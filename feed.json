      "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-Italian influencer who ranks as world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality, has been named as a goodwill ambassador by the U.N.'s children\u2019s agency",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- DAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Khaby Lame, the Senegal-born world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality who never says a word in videos watched by millions of followers, addressed the youth in his native country on Friday when he was appointed as UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",
      "The 24-year-old influencer, who has over 162 million followers, rose to fame with charming videos of his reactions to everyday life in which he never says a word. His following surged during the pandemic, when he was fired from his factory job and used the extra time on his hands to make and upload more videos.",
      "Being a UNICEF ambassador will allow him to \u201csee all the world and its problems,\u201d Lame said, adding that he hoped he could contribute to solving some of them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a true honor to be appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador and be part of an organization that puts children\u2019s rights front and center every day,\u201d Lame said in a statement. \u201cFrom my own experience as a child fearing poverty, struggling to find my passion at school, and losing my job during the COVID-19 pandemic, to finding my place and calling in the world, I know that all children can thrive when they are given a chance and opportunity.\u201d",
      "Senegal is a major source of irregular migration to Europe. Over 60% of Senegalese people are under 25, and 90% work in informal jobs. They have watched for years as money made from natural resources has gone overseas, and many say they have no other choice but to embark on treacherous journeys in rickety fishing boats across the Atlantic.",
      "\u201cI tell them to dream big,\u201d Lame said when asked about his message to Senegal's youth. \u201cTry and do your best to accomplish your dreams, even though there are people telling you that you cannot reach them.\u201d",
      "Lame moved to Italy from his native Senegal when he was an infant with his working class parents, but was only granted Italian citizenship when he was 20.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in Italy for 20 years since I was only 2 years old,\u201d Lame told The Associated Press in Dakar. Looking sharp in a beige suit and a matching tie, he added: \u201cMy blood is from Senegal, but I feel Senegalese and Italian at the same time.\u201d",
      "Lame's appointment to UNICEF came at the end of a four-day visit to Senegal where he met children and young people who are driving positive change in their communities.",

    "story": [
      "Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, was kidnapped by JNIM, a branch of al-Qaida in Africa's Sahel region, while on his way to interview one of the group's leaders in northern Mali",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For a foreign correspondent in Mali, the assignment seemed like a dream: as Islamic extremists upended the region, Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, secured a rare interview with a leader of JNIM, an al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in the Sahel.",
      "Or so he thought. En route to the interview in Gao, northern Mali, in April 2021, Dubois, a correspondent for Lib\u00e9ration and Jeune Afrique publications, was kidnapped.",
      "He spent 711 days in desert captivity, sleeping chained to a tree, eating dried goat meat and plotting his escape. Nearly two years after his release, he recounts his ordeal in a book released Thursday in France that draws heavily on notes Dubois secretly kept during his captivity, written on any scrap of paper he could find.",
      "\u201cOne of the main factors that helped me resist and survive was telling myself that I am a journalist,\u201d Dubois told The Associated Press in the first interview for English-language media since his release. \"Let\u2019s continue to gather information, let\u2019s continue to ask questions and pretend I\u2019m working.\"",
      "The Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in recent years have been upended by military coups and are now led by military juntas, which struggle against rising extremist violence and have made kidnappings a cornerstone of their strategy in the region.",
      "Upon his release, French media published an investigation revealing that Dubois's fixer had worked with French intelligence, who used him to locate the extremist leader he was trying to interview.",
      "Dubois told the AP he knew his project was risky, but that he trusted his fixer too much and ignored the warning signs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said of the circumstances surrounding his kidnapping. \u201cI think it was a betrayal. But the motive for the betrayal is not yet clear. I have not spoken to my fixer since I have been released.\u201d",
      "Kidnappings have skyrocketed in the Sahel in recent years, according to data from the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.",
      "JNIM, the Sahelian branch of al-Qaida, has been responsible for most of the 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, according to the ACLED. The group relies on ransom money to fund their operations and on the fear they instill on local populations to keep them in check.",
      "Dubois recalled being told he would be \"released quickly\u201d if his family and government did as instructed.",
      "Dubois was released on March 20, 2023, in Agadez, Niger, but details of his release, including whether a ransom was paid, remain undisclosed.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron took to the social platform X to write \u201cOlivier Dubois is free,\" but he did not elaborate on the conditions of the release.",
      "Speaking to the AP, Dubois said that he did not know the details either, but he recalled being told by the rebels that ransoms varied by nationality. As a French citizen, he was worth 10 million euros, he was told. A South African was worth 50 million.",
      "Having covered numerous hostage stories in the region, Dubois knew that even if freed, his ordeal could be lengthy.",
      "In order to stay sane, he became obsessed with plotting an escape. But after the fourth unsuccessful attempt, his captors staged a mock execution and threatened to kill him if he tried again. So instead, Dubois started reading the Quran.",
      "Reading the holy book of Islam served a dual purpose: it occupied his mind, and helped him understand his captors better, be able to discuss with them and build a relationship, so they could treat him more as a human being and less as an anonymous hostage.",
      "Unexpectedly, it also put him on a more spiritual path.",
      "\"I am a former atheist, then an agnostic who thought I\u2019d stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cReading the Quran made me want to read other religious texts. This captivity has been the beginning of a journey that will perhaps lead me to God \u2014 or not.\u201d",
      "Now that his book \u2014 \u201cPrisonnier du d\u00e9sert, 711 jours aux mains d\u2019Al-Qa\u00efda,\u201d which translates in English into \u201cPrisoner of the desert, 711 days in the hands of Al-Qaida\u201d \u2014 is out, Dubois said he was hoping he was ready to go back to journalism and move on.",
      "But the experience still haunts him.",
      "\u201cIt was painful labour,\u201d he said of the writing process. \u201cThe first reflex after finishing it was to distance myself from the story, hoping time will pass and, maybe, all of that will be behind me. But I don't really know if that's possible.\u201d"

      "In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer is challenging the account of his accuser, who says he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In a stretch of questioning crucial to the defense of A$AP Rocky, his lawyer on Friday challenged the account of his accuser, who said he suffered a hand injury when the hip-hop performer fired a gun at him in 2021.",
      "Superstar singer Rihanna, Rocky\u2019s partner and the mother of their two children, watched from the audience as the man who goes by A$AP Relli, a former friend of Rocky, underwent a second day of cross-examination at the Los Angeles trial that left him visibly frustrated and at times angry.",
      "She slipped into court for a third day about 30 minutes into the testimony and sat next to Rocky\u2019s mother after coming in through a public entrance. After the lunch break, she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time. She had been brought in privately, out of view of the public, on her previous visits.",
      "Relli had testified under prosecution questioning that his hand felt hot when Rocky fired at him on a Hollywood street and his hand was grazed. A photo was shown of scrapes that had torn the skin on his knuckles.",
      "He did not seek medical attention until two days later in New York.",
      "\u201cYou waited to fly all the way across country before seeking medical attention?\u201d defense attorney Joe Tacopina asked.",
      "\u201cI had my hand wrapped that night,\u201d Relli said, then acknowledged he had.",
      "He said that after the incident, \u201cI didn't trust LA. I didn't trust nobody.\u201d",
      "Through their opening statement and the cross-examination, Rocky's attorneys have suggested Relli only sought medical attention because the lawyer in a separate civil case where he's seeking money from the rapper, told him he should.",
      "Relli at first denied that he had been acting on his lawyer's advice, but later conceded after hearing his previous testimony.",
      "\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about getting the police involved, your endgame was getting money from Rocky, correct?\u201d Tacopina asked.",
      "Relli answered, \u201cNo. I wanted protection. I wasn\u2019t sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Tacopina also challenged him about the short time he spent at the hospital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one hour and 36 minutes for a gunshot, yeah?\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cIt was two days later,\u201d Relli replied.",
      "Anticipating the defense tactic, the prosecution told jurors during their opening statement that for the charges in the case \u2014 two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 it doesn't matter whether Relli was injured.",
      "Relli appeared angry and frustrated throughout the testimony. He constantly asked if questions were relevant, muttered to himself, and had to be instructed by the judge to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d After listening to two different recordings of phone calls the defense said were him, he declared both were fake.",
      "Guilty findings on both counts could lead to a maximum of 24 years in prison for Rocky.",
      "That verdict could be a major turning point in the life of the rapper, who this weekend is nominated for his third Grammy Award at a ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles from the trial.",
      "Rocky's attorneys are arguing, in a revelation made just before the trial began, that the gun he fired was a starter pistol that carried only blanks that he had just as a prop for security. They allege Relli knew this.",
      "Relli testified under prosecution questioning that he had not known Rocky to carry a gun.",
      "When Tacopina returned to the question, Relli hedged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really chill with him every day, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the time I chill with him, I don\u2019t know him carrying guns.\u201d",
      "Tacopina continued, \u201cWell one thing you know, is for sure he doesn't carry a prop gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho carries a prop gun?\u201d Relli answered. \u201cWho\u2019s going to come to a situation and carry a prop gun?\u201d",
      "After the jury was dismissed for lunch, a vicious argument broke out between Tacopina and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin over a racy photo of Relli's girlfriend that he showed Relli to identify her.",
      "Lewin argued it was an attempt to inflame the witness, and that the defense's entire case failed to address the actual incident, including \u201cthis prop gun garbage!\u201d",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh!?\u201d Tacopina shouted back. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "Tacopina then called Relli a perjurer, and said that the prosecutors were abetting him.",
      "As it got even louder and more personal, the judge, who seemed disgusted, walked out.",
      "He had previously instructed the men, who have butted heads often, only to talk to each other on the record. In this case they were, though the cameras had been turned off.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers.",

      "Wearing a long black dress with buttons that resembled an overcoat, she watched the proceedings calmly and periodically moved oversized, tortoiseshell glasses from atop her head to her eyes.",

      "Rocky fired another shot that he didn't see because had hidden behind a mutual friend who was there with the rapper, who ran away after that.",
      "He said, \u201cI felt my hand hot,\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer, who will get to cross-examine Relli on Thursday, says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified under prosecution questioning, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \u201cU try killing me.\u201d",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. Rihanna revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020."

      "Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "Superstar singer Rihanna has made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",
      "He said \u201cI felt my hand hot\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum, which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul within the next ten years",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",

      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

    "summary": "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

      "\"I've had multiple doctors look at it and tell me they don't know what's going on,\" Hayes said about her tongue.",
      "",
      "Estimates of prevalence range considerably, depending on how researchers define long COVID in a given study, but the CDC puts it at 17 million adults.",
      "",
      "Despite long COVID's vast reach, the federal government's investment in researching the disease  --  to the tune of $1.15 billion as of December  --  has so far failed to bring any new treatments to market.",
      "",
      "This disappoints and angers the patient community, who say the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should focus on ways to stop their suffering instead of simply trying to understand why they're suffering.",
      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",
      "",
      "Hayes said she would definitely volunteer for an investigational drug trial. For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family. At the same time, Hayes doesn't want to spend the rest of her life on a beige couch.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 02:30:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The M23 rebel group that is backed by Rwanda has emerged as a more potent force after being crushed during their first rebellion in 2012",
    "story": [
      "The M23 rebel group that is backed by Rwanda has emerged as a more potent force after being crushed during their first rebellion in 2012",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- After Rwanda-backed M23 rebels took control of the biggest city in eastern Congo this week, the man who emerged from the shadows to assert his leadership was not the group's long-time military leader.",
      "Sultani Makenga, an ethnic Tutsi rebel leader sanctioned by both the U.S. and the U.N., was nowhere to be seen in Goma\u2019s Serena Hotel as the bearded Corneille Nangaa, in military fatigues, was ushered into the hall. Nangaa, who is not a Tutsi and who analysts say brings a more diverse, Congolese face to the group, told reporters of his plan to fight all the way to Kinshasa, the national capital a thousand miles away.",
      "The spectacle was significant because it captures the evolution of M23 from an ethnic Tutsi-dominated outfit more than a decade ago to one that\u2019s now actively seeking to be seen as a Congolese nationalist group. That's the case despite the military support it gets from neighboring Rwanda, according to observers and analysts in Africa\u2019s Great Lakes region.",
      "Nangaa is the former head of Congo's electoral body who oversaw the 2018 presidential election won by President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi. He has been a controversial figure in Congolese politics for years. As the election commission chair, he oversaw the heavily criticized vote that elected Tshisekedi and led the U.S. to sanction him in 2019 for undermining Congo's democracy.",
      "A falling-out with Congolese authorities, including a dispute over a mining concession, sent Nangaa into exile in Kenya. In 2023, he joined the Congo River Alliance, a political-military coalition including 17 parties and rebel groups opposed to the government of Tshisekedi and became a top political figure.",
      "Besides the mining, his grievance is also believed to be due to the president\u2019s alleged refusal to advocate for the U.S. dropping Nangaa from its sanctions list, according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol. \u201cHis perception that he had been mistreated by the authorities is what pushed him towards radicalization,\u201d Moleka said.",
      "Last year, Makenga\u2019s M23 joined Nangaa\u2019s Congo River Alliance and with Nangaa at the helm of the revamped outfit, the M23 looked even more menacing to Congolese authorities, analysts say.",
      "M23 is more of a threat now because the group is trying to \u201cdecouple the question of self-determination in eastern Congo\u201d from evidence of Rwandan support, said Angelo Izama, an analyst with the Uganda-based Fanaka Kwawote think tank.",
      "The rebels want to provoke a national discussion on widespread feelings of neglect in eastern Congo while gaining \u201cas much territory as possible such that they can force the Congolese state to deal with questions of genuine autonomy and to force some kind of negotiation,\u201d he said.",
      "Forcing political negotiations is \u201ca smart move\u201d for the rebels, \u201cthe only path out of this crisis,\u201d he added.",
      "Unlike in 2012, when the M23 took Goma in a campaign led by Kinyarwanda-speaking fighters pushing mainly for their full integration into the Congolese army, \u201cthis time it has a national agenda,\u201d the Crisis Group think tank said of M23 in a recent assessment.",
      "With Nangaa\u2019s Congo River Alliance as the \u201cpolitical umbrella\" for the M23, the think tank said the rebels have accumulated resources and allies that made them \u201cattractive partners not only to armed groups in eastern (Congo) but to others aiming to undermine Tshisekedi.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is in line with (Rwanda's) probable strategy of creating a deniable but powerful Congolese front to exact the maximum leverage over Kinshasa and confirm its dominance of North Kivu (province), at a minimum,\u201d the think tank said.",
      "United Nations experts have asserted that some 4,000 Rwandan troops back M23 rebels in North Kivu. To take Goma, which is strategically located close to the Rwanda border, the rebels defeated Congolese government troops who long had been supported by local militias known as Wazalendo as well as U.N. and regional peacekeepers and mercenaries from Europe.",
      "M23 has about 6,500 fighters, according to U.N. estimates. It emerged in 2012 as a rebel group led by Congolese ethnic Tutsis who said a 2009 agreement signed to look after their interests \u2014 including integration into the army and the return of refugees from elsewhere in east Africa \u2014 had been violated by Congo\u2019s government.",
      "Led by Makenga, a Congolese Tutsi, M23 took Goma in a November 2012 offensive and pulled out days later under international pressure. They were later repulsed by U.N. forces fighting alongside Congolese government troops in a military campaign that forced hundreds of them to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. Makenga, a self-appointed major-general often seen wielding a herder\u2019s staff in the bush, was among those who fled to Uganda.",
      "In December 2013, with hundreds of the rebels cantoned in a remote forested area of western Uganda, M23 signed an agreement with Congo\u2019s government that called for the repatriation of the rebels to Congo within a year. That proved difficult to achieve because of a dispute over the rebels\u2019 demand for a blanket amnesty while Congo\u2019s government wanted commanders such as Makenga tried for their alleged crimes against civilians.",
      "In 2016, hundreds of M23 rebels fled custody in Uganda, from where they were to be airlifted back to Congo. The rebels resurfaced in 2021 and became the most potent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in the mineral-rich territory. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates mineral deposits there to be worth $24 trillion, most of them crucial to global technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, Nangaa's selling point as the face of M23 is that he is from the Haut-Uele province and not Tutsi,\" said Moleka with the Dypol Congolese think tank. \"This allows M23 to give itself a new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,\u201d said Moleka.",
      "The Washington-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies, in an analysis published Wednesday, cited \u201ca shifting political calculus by sponsors\" of M23. Efforts to establish a parallel civilian administration and expand the illicit exploitation of minerals \u201csuggests that the rebel group and their regional backers have longer-term objectives in holding and potentially expanding their territorial control,\" according to the assessment by Paul Nantulya, a Ugandan analyst with the group.",
      "At an M23 news conference in Goma on Thursday, Nangaa said the rebels aim to set up a new administration in the city of 2 million people that's now home to hundreds of thousands of displaced Congolese. The rebels spoke to reporters of their plans to return displaced people to their homes, presenting a major challenge to Tshisekedi.",
      "\"We are here in Goma to stay as Congolese,\u201d Nangaa said. \u201cWe will continue the march for liberation all the way to Kinshasa.\u201d",

      "The hostages to be released, according to Hamas and Israel, are: Yarden Bibas, 35; American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65; and French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54. All were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war.",
      "News that Yarden Bibas, 35, is among the hostages set to be freed on Saturday brought renewed attention to the uncertain fate of the Bibas family. Hamas says his kidnapped wife and two young boys were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but Israel has not verified the claim.",
      "A video of their abduction by armed men showed Shiri swaddling in a blanket her two redheaded boys \u2014 Ariel, 4, and Kfir, 9 months old at the time. Kfir was the youngest of about 250 people taken captive on Oct. 7, and his plight quickly came to represent the helplessness and anger the hostage-taking stirred in Israel, where the Bibas family has become a household name.",
      "Like Bibas, Kalderon was also captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His two children and ex-wife, Hadas, were also taken, but they were freed during the 2023 ceasefire.",
      "Keith Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. She was released during the 2023 ceasefire and has waged a high-profile campaign  to free Keith and other hostages.",
      "Today\u2019s exchange is part of a deal that paused fighting in Gaza on Jan. 19. Israeli forces have pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance.",
      "It calls for Hamas to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.",
      "The initial Phase One ceasefire paused fighting for six weeks, calling for the sides to use that time to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Negotiating a phase two deal could be difficult. Hamas says it won\u2019t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, after reasserting its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, and a key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire\u2019s first phase."

      "Dressed in pristine white robes to symbolize purity and equality before God, worshippers filled the streets leading to Yoff\u2019s beachside mosque on Friday. The gathering, known as \u201cL\u2019Appel,\" (\"The Call\"), marked the 145th anniversary of Seydina Limamou Laye\u2019s controversial declaration as the prophet.",
      "The Layene brotherhood, while smaller than Senegal\u2019s other Sufi orders such as the Mouride or Tijan, has gained attention for its distinctive beliefs, including the claim that their founder was a reincarnation of the Prophet Muhammad.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any Sufi order where the idea of reincarnation is so central as it is with the Layene,\u201d said Cheikh Babou, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in Sufism in West Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything else in Senegal or elsewhere in the Muslim world.\u201d",
      "As part of the celebrations, worshippers made a pilgrimage to the sacred grotto where Seydina Limamou Laye first retreated for meditation and \u2014 according to believers \u2014 received divine inspiration. The site remains a powerful symbol of his spiritual awakening and a place of connection between the Layene community and their founder.",
      "His message emphasized that the Prophet Muhammad had returned in his form as a Black man to restore justice and correct societal wrongs, including those caused by slavery. This message of racial equality and spiritual unity continues to resonate with followers today.",
      "\u201cIt is a pride for both Black and white people because Seydina Limamou Laye is not the prophet of Black people; he is a universal prophet,\u201d said Moussa Lahi, a Layene who attended this year\u2019s events. \u201cSo, there are white people, Black people, yellow people \u2013 everyone. He brought equality among the races.\u201d",

      "Ambulance services stretched thin in the U.K. are drawing attention to the non-emergency calls that are hampering their response times",
      "LONDON -- If your pet alligator escapes, don't call for an ambulance \u2014 unless it has sunk its teeth into someone.",
      "That's the message from the Welsh Ambulance Service in a plea to get people to stop phoning with non-emergencies.",
      "With public health services stretched thin in the U.K., there is no shortage of anecdotes about people suffering from true health emergencies who wait hours for medical care \u2014 whether from paramedics or a hospital doctor. But the ambulance service said 15% of its 426,000 calls last year \u2014 175 a day \u2014 were not urgent. Some weren't even health-related and were far from being matters of life and death.",
      "There was a call about a chipped tooth (\"it's starting to throb\"), a bloody toe (\"I\u2019ve cut my little nail on the toe and I\u2019ve nipped across the top of it.\") and a person who stuck their finger in an electrical socket who appeared to be fine (\"I\u2019m worried that I could be electrocuted\").",
      "Then there was the call Emma Worrall took last year that she won't soon forget.",
      "\u201cI remember saying \u2018alligator?\u2019 and my call-taker supervisor just looked at me and was like, \u2018What is going on in your call?\u2019\u201d Worrall said.",
      "As a dispatcher in a busy call center in Wales, Worrall has to be unflappable, patient and able to efficiently handle the most stressful calls in which a delay of seconds or minutes could be the difference between life and death.",
      "She understands that some people have a different gauge of what is life-threatening and an emergency. But it's still frustrating when someone phones the emergency number to say they\u2019re locked out of their house and cold or their dog jumped in a river and won\u2019t swim back \u2014 calls she also fielded.",
      "\u201cWe just ask everybody to find alternative pathways before phoning for an ambulance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ambulance service is for those who are experiencing life-threatening problems.\u201d",
      "Worrall\u2019s craziest call came one afternoon when a man phoned to say his son\u2019s pet alligator had escaped and was hiding under the sofa.",
      "\u201cI asked if he\u2019d been hurt, and he said, no. he was scared,\u201d Worrall recounted.",
      "He wanted paramedics to help him corral the toothy reptile.",
      "\u201cI told him that we wouldn\u2019t be sending an ambulance for something like that. And he said, \u2018So you\u2019re not going to send me any help until I get bit, is that right?\u2019 I went, \u2018That\u2019s correct.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Welsh Ambulance Service isn't alone in publicizing the wacky calls they got last year. The South Western Ambulance Service in England this week said more than a quarter of the 1 million-plus calls it fielded last year did not merit sending help.",
      "The non-emergency calls included a person looking for assistance in finding their walking stick, a patient who had fallen off a chair \u2014 who was already in the hospital \u2014 and a woman who complained of having a \u201chorrendous nightmare.\u201d",
      "Emergency calls \u201care for situations where minutes matter and lives are at risk,\u201d said William Lee, assistant operations director at South Western Ambulance. \u201cInappropriate calls tie up our emergency lines and divert valuable resources away from those in genuine need.\"",
      "Worrall was gobsmacked the gator caller thought paramedics were the panacea for his problem. When she got off the phone, she took a short break and shared the story with her amused colleagues.",
      "\u201cWe did have a little chat about that and, yeah, back to work I went,\u201d she said. \u201cOn to the next call.\u201d"

      "A startup in Mexico is trying to help get a handle on one Gulf coast city\u2019s plastic waste problem by converting it into gasoline, diesel and other fuels",
      "BOCA DEL RIO, Mexico -- A startup in Mexico is trying to help get a handle on one Gulf coast city\u2019s plastic waste problem by converting it into gasoline, diesel and other fuels.",
      "With less than 10% of the world\u2019s plastics being recycled, Petgas\u2019 idea is that rather than letting discarded plastic become waste, it can become productive again as fuel.",
      "Petgas developed a machine in the port city of Boca del Rio that uses pyrolysis, a thermodynamic process that heats plastics in the absence of oxygen, breaking it down to produce gasoline, diesel, kerosene, paraffin and coke.",
      "Carlos Parraguirre D\u00edaz, chief technology officer at Petgas, said that in a week, the machine can process 1.5 tons of plastics and produce 356 gallons (1,350 liters) of fuel.",
      "The process does require propane to initiate the heating, but once the pyrolysis begins, the gas it produces is used to keep it going, according to the company. And using fuel it produces does throw off carbon dioxide, but the company says its net impact is less than comparable fuels because their fuel is lower in sulfur.",
      "Parraguirre D\u00edaz said that the machine shows that \u201cwe can transform that (plastic) into a product that\u2019s useful and has high value in the world economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn place of having a dump, it\u2019s as if we dug into the earth and found hydrocarbons that can be used by our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Global plastic production, already exceeding 400 million tons annually, could surge by 70% by 2040 without policy changes, according to the United Nations. China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the United States.",
      "Many plastics are used for packaging. Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world\u2019s oceans, rivers and lakes.",
      "Negotiations on a treaty to end plastic pollution concluded in Busan, South Korea in December without reaching an agreement. This was supposed to be the fifth and final round to produce the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.",
      "Petgas envisions a circular economy where plastic is no longer waste, but rather a resource for the production of energy.",
      "To that end, the company has organized plastic collection drives to remove bottles and other material from the city\u2019s beaches. It encourages people to bring plastic waste to a drop-off point and receives most of its material clean and shredded from a recycler.",
      "Alexa Mendoza, a biologist specializing in plastic contamination of the sea who is not involved in the project, said Petgas plan was a good initiative, but a \u201cband-aid\u201d for a massive global problem.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me a solution to put a band-aid on it and say, \u2018great, it\u2019s solved and let\u2019s do it,\u2019 but rather it could be a first step,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cFrom there, with the help of scientists you could take into account what needs to be adjusted so that it doesn\u2019t become another source of pollution.\"",
      "For now, Petgas donates the fuel it produces to the local fire department and food delivery services.",
      "\"The future is being able to really take production to a scale that has impact,\u201d said Parraguirre D\u00edaz.",

      "BANGKOK -- Peace prospects look bleak in Myanmar as a civil war rages despite international pressure on the military four years after it seized power from an elected civilian government.",
      "The political situation remains tense with no negotiation space in sight between the military government and the major opposition groups fighting against it.",
      "The four years after the army's takeover on Feb. 1, 2021, have created a profound situation of multiple, overlapping crises with nearly half the population in poverty and the economy in disarray, the U.N. Development Program said.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said the military ramped up violence against civilians last year to unprecedented levels, inflicting the heaviest civilian death toll since the army takeover as its grip on power eroded.",
      "The army launched wave after wave of retaliatory airstrikes and artillery shelling on civilians and civilian populated areas, forced thousands of young people into military service, conducted arbitrary arrests and prosecutions, caused mass displacement, and denied access to humanitarians, even in the face of natural disasters, the rights office said in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cAfter four years, it is deeply distressing to find that the situation on the ground for civilians is only getting worse by the day,\u201d U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said. \u201cEven as the military\u2019s power wanes, their atrocities and violence have expanded in scope and intensity,\u201d he said, adding that the retaliatory nature of the attacks were designed to control, intimidate, and punish the population.",
      "The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others criticized the military takeover in a statement that also called for the release of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.",
      "They said nearly 20 million people need humanitarian assistance and up to 3.5 million people are displaced internally, an increase of nearly 1 million in the last year. They also expressed concern about increased cross-border crime in Myanmar such as drug and human trafficking and online scam operations, which affect neighboring countries and risk broader instability.",
      "\u201cThe current trajectory is not sustainable for Myanmar or the region,\u201d the countries said in the joint statement that also included Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.",
      "The military's 2021 takeover prompted widespread public protests, whose violent suppression by security forces triggered an armed resistance that has now led to a state of civil war. Ethnic minority militias and people\u2019s defense forces that support Myanmar\u2019s main opposition control large parts of the country, while the military holds much of central Myanmar and big cities including the capital, Naypyidaw.",
      "The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the repression of the military government, said that at least 6,239 were killed and 28,444 were arrested since the takeover. The actual death toll is likely to be much higher since the group does not generally include deaths on the side of the military government and cannot easily verify cases in remote areas.",
      "Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank, told The Associated Press that Myanmar's current situation is at its worst with peace and development being pushed back.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s worse is that the sovereignty which ever-proclaimed by the military is losing, and the country\u2019s borders could even shift,\u201d Aung Thu Nyein said in a text message.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s army suffered unprecedented battlefield defeats over the past year, when a coalition of ethnic armed groups won victories in the northeast near the Chinese border and in the western state of Rakhine.",
      "The ethnic rebels were able to quickly capture several towns, military bases and two important regional commands, and their offensive weakened the army\u2019s grip in other parts of the country.",
      "The ethnic minorities have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government and are loosely allied with the People\u2019s Defense Force, the pro-democracy armed resistance formed after the army\u2019s 2021 takeover.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office and rights groups including Amnesty International also made rare allegations in recent statements that armed groups opposing the military have also committed human rights violations in areas under their control.",
      "In pursuit of a political solution, the military government is pushing for an election, which it has promised to hold this year. Critics say the election would not be free or fair as civil rights have been curtailed and many political opponents imprisoned and the election would be an attempt to normalize military control.",
      "On Friday, the military government extended a state of emergency another six months because it said more time was needed to restore stability before the election, state-run MRTV television reported. No exact date for the polls was given.",
      "Tom Andrews, a special rapporteur working with the U.N. human rights office, said it wasn't possible to hold a legitimate election while arresting, detaining, torturing and executing leaders of the opposition and when it is illegal for journalists or citizens to criticize the military government.",
      "\u201cGovernments should dismiss these plans for what they are \u2013 a fraud,\u201d Tom Andrews said."

      "A busy shelter for migrants in southern Mexico has been left without a doctor",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A busy shelter for migrants in southern Mexico has been left without a doctor. A program to provide mental health support for LGBTQ+ youth fleeing Venezuela was disbanded. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Guatemala, so-called \u201cSafe Mobility Offices\u201d where migrants can apply to enter the U.S. legally have shuttered.",
      "Barely a week into Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, his order to halt U.S. foreign assistance is having a profound effect on an issue that propelled him to the White House: migration.",
      "Across Latin America, grassroots organizations that assist migrants have been gutted, the already perilous trek northward has become more confusing and the future of programs to root out the violence, poverty and human rights abuses that has driven historic levels of migration in recent years are hanging by a thread.",
      "Trump, within hours of taking office Jan. 20, ordered a sweeping 90-day freeze on most U.S. foreign assistance disbursed through the State Department. The decision immediately halted thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide, forcing U.S. aid organizations and partners in the field to slash hundreds of aid workers.",
      "The United States is the world\u2019s largest source of foreign assistance by far, although several European countries allocate a much bigger share of their budgets. While aid to Africa dwarfs the roughly $2 billion that Latin America receives annually, the Western Hemisphere has long been a spending priority of both Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "The region is closely tied to the U.S. through trade and migration as well as the flow of narcotics. And the rising influence of China and Russia in recent years has only enhanced the strategic importance of what used to be referred to, disparagingly, as \u201cWashington's backyard.\u201d",
      "It's a message that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is likely to reinforce when starting Saturday he visits Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic in his first official overseas trip.",
      "Trump has made it a priority to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally and many of the aid programs he halted are funded through the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which provides humanitarian assistance to those fleeing persecution, crisis, or violence.",
      "One such beneficiary is the Peace Oasis of the Holy Spirit Amparito shelter in the southern Mexican city of Villahermosa. The shelter has been treading water for months as Mexican authorities \u2014 under pressure from the U.S. to stem migration flows \u2014 have dumped migrants rounded up throughout the country.",
      "The aid freeze dealt another blow, forcing the charitable organization that runs the facility to fire its only doctor as well as a social worker and child psychologist.",
      "In the days since Trump's order, the shelter has been appealing to the Mexican government for alternate funding for programs managed by the United Nations to pay for flights and bus rides to Mexico's southern border with Guatemala for migrants who want to return home. Currently, four families from Honduras, Ecuador and El Salvador are stranded.",
      "\u201cThe crisis is only going to worsen,\u201d the shelter said in a statement. \u201cThe most affected will be the population we serve.\u201d",
      "Some 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) away from Villahermosa, in the Colombian capital of Bogota, aid workers are also scrambling.",
      "The city is a major hub for the more than 7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic collapse and abuse under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's increasingly authoritarian rule. Colombia is also the starting point for the more than 800,000 migrants \u2014 the majority Venezuelan \u2014 who have set out the past two years on the dangerous trek northward through once impenetrable Darien Gap connecting Central and South America on their way to the U.S.",
      "Among the most marginalized migrant groups are LGBTQ+ youth, who suffer significantly higher rates of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. The Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, for the past year has been readying a U.S.-funded project to provide mental health support to LGBTQ+ teenagers, from Venezuela as well Colombians internally displaced by decades of armed conflict.",
      "Leila Younes, a Lebanese gender specialist, had just arrived in Bogota to launch the project when she saw the devastating email with the stop-work order by the State Department. After breaking the news to local partners, she immediately returned home \u2014 and now the Human Rights Center is urgently seeking $300,000 to continue the research",
      "\"We spent a year preparing with our partners, and overnight, we were told to stop,\u201d said Younes. \u201cNo transition, no time to secure other funding.\u201d",
      "Although the White House only paused humanitarian assistance for 90 days pending further review, Younes said she's under no illusion the work \u2014 and a sister project in Poland among Ukrainian youth fleeing the war with Russia \u2014 will resume. Trump on the campaign trail repeatedly blasted transgender youth and has issued sweeping orders instructing the federal government to terminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a funding cut\u2014it\u2019s part of a rollback on LGBTQI+ rights,\u201d said Younes.",
      "The first Trump administration funded several programs by Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to integrate the Venezuelan diaspora as well as those by Costa Rica to resettle opponents of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. The aid aligned closely with Trump's foreign policy goals to isolate anti-democratic governments and helped discourage migrants from heading to the U.S., said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re likely to see much of the foreign assistance in the region understood through a migration lens,\u201d said Selee. \u201cThat means stopping funding for programs that support migrants in transit but perhaps increasing funding for efforts to integrate returned migrants and those already living in other countries in the region.\u201d",
      "What is less likely to resume, says Selee, is foreign aid attacking the root causes of migration \u2014 a priority, at least initially, of the Biden administration. Trump has also suspended offices opened by Biden in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Guatemala where migrants could apply for asylum and other legal pathways to enter the U.S. instead of trekking to the border.",
      "Traditionally, U.S. funding in Latin America has been channeled to support everything from child health nutrition, legal reform and press freedom. By far the biggest chunk funds security assistance to combat gangs, eradicate illegal crops and strengthen the rule of law.",
      "Liliana Ayalde, a former American ambassador to Brazil and Paraguay, said long term investments in state-building like the more than $10 billion spent on \u201cPlan Colombia\u201d since 2000 generate enormous goodwill even if it is difficult to measure the number of people who chose not to uproot as a result of such assistance.",
      "\u201cTrust isn\u2019t something you can turn on and off in a conflict zone,\u201d said Ayalde, who started her diplomatic career at the U.S. Agency for International Development and now serves on the board of two non-profit organizations who also saw their funding cut. \u201cPartners aren\u2019t going to trust the U.S. again if they don\u2019t feel safe and think we\u2019re in it for the long haul.\u201d",
      "That may good news for China, Washington\u2019s top adversary for influence in Latin America. As Latin America has faded from the U.S. foreign policy agenda since the end of the Cold War, China has made deep inroads through billions in infrastructure investment and no-string attached lending.",
      "\u201cChampagne bottles are uncorking right now in Beijing,\u201d said Adam Isacson, who has studied foreign aid trends for years and directs the defense oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cIt's really hard for the U.S. to compete with a geopolitical rival when we're disarming unilaterally.\u201d",

      "The warning came as Olof Skoog, the EU's special representative for human rights, wrapped up a weeklong visit to Islamabad.",
      "The visit was aimed at engaging \u201cPakistan on the most pressing human rights and labor rights issues and discussing Pakistan\u2019s plans to address them, including in view of the ongoing assessment under the GSP+ trade scheme,\u201d the EU said in a statement.",
      "Pakistan's exports to Europe have doubled since 2014 when it was awarded the status of duty-free exporter under the EU\u2019s Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, or GSP+, incentives for developing countries.",

      "The statement said that Skoog, during his meeting with Pakistani authorities, \u201chighlighted areas of concern such as the application of blasphemy laws, women\u2019s rights, forced marriages and conversions, enforced disappearances, freedoms of expression, religion or belief, independence of the media, impunity for rights violations, due process and the right to a fair trial, civic space, and the death penalty.\u201d",

      "The bill, which now has become a law after President Asif Ali Zardari's approval, grants the government extensive powers to impose heavy fines and incarcerate social media users for spreading disinformation. Journalists rallied on Friday across Pakistan, vowing to resist any laws aimed at suppressing freedom of speech.",

      "TOCUYITO, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro labeled them as terrorists on national television. They were plucked from pharmacies, apartment buildings and other locations, and thrown in prison for months. Many then endured severe beatings, food deprivation and other forms of torture. Virtually all developed stomach infections and lost weight. Three died.",
      "More than 2,200 people were detained after Venezuela\u2019s July presidential election, when civil unrest broke out over Maduro\u2019s claim to victory. With dissent firmly squelched, the government has slowly released nearly 1,900 of the mostly poor, politically unaffiliated twenty-somethings.",
      "Tearful reunions with family, some as recently as Friday, have brought them an immense sense of relief, but it vanishes with the realization that they are not truly free, neither physically nor mentally.",
      "Now at home, the former detainees, particularly those who participated in post-election demonstrations, must also cope with the disappointment that the votes they defended on the streets did not push Maduro out of office or produce the change they hoped for.",
      "\u201cYou go home, see your loved ones and get drunk on happiness, but 24-48 hours later, reality hits you,\u201d a man who was detained for more than five months told The Associated Press. \u201cWhat is the reality? My fundamental rights were violated, and I am still at the mercy of the same government.\u201d",
      "The man and relatives of other former detainees narrated to AP how the government\u2019s repressive apparatus wrecked their lives after the July 28 election. Most spoke under the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from the government or its network of ruling-party loyalists who through physical force and control of state subsidies quash dissent.",
      "Former detainees suffer insomnia, cannot be among crowds and tremble at the sight of a police officer. They have heart conditions not typical of young adults. They are worse off financially than before the election and cannot find work partly because their IDs were seized during their arrests.",
      "They feel doubly insulted having to tap into the government\u2019s precarious health, food and cash programs, but some see no other alternatives.",
      "The families of the former detainees are indebted to loan sharks and acquaintances after spending hundreds of dollars in transportation as well as meals, medicines, toiletries and other items not provided by the corrections system. Some mothers sob at night. Others silently carry the guilt that comes from having their children home again while other families are still making prison visits.",
      "\u201cThe intimidation to which we are being subjected \u2013 the psychological damage that they are causing us \u2013 is the worst thing that can be done to a population\u2026 with a desire for freedom,\u201d the mother of a former detainee said. \u201cThat is terrorism.\u201d",

More than 20 people were killed during the unrest.",

      "Previous protests were led primarily by young, college-educated, middle- and upper-class Venezuelans of European descent who openly embraced the country\u2019s political opposition. But at the end of July, those on the streets were adolescents and young adults whose lives have been marked by poverty and letdowns from Maduro\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cThey were the children and grandchildren of the people who voted for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,\u201d Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea, said referring to Maduro\u2019s predecessor. \u201cThey did not identify with the opposition. They came out in rejection of the poor management of the election results.\u201d",

      "As time wore on inside overcrowded and sweltering cells, a few attempted suicide, some leaned into prayer and many were convinced they would all be freed by Jan. 11, the day after the presidential term, by law, begins in Venezuela. Those fixated on that deadline were banking on Gonz\u00e1lez fulfilling his promise to return from exile and be sworn in as president.",

      "Friday marks five years since Britain left the European Union at 11 p.m. on Jan. 31, 2020",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Five years ago Friday, two crowds of people gathered near Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 some with Union Jacks and cheers, others European Union flags and tears.",
      "On Jan. 31, 2020 at 11 p.m. London time \u2013 midnight at EU headquarters in Brussels \u2014 the U.K. officially left the bloc after almost five decades of membership that had brought free movement and free trade between Britain and 27 other European countries.",
      "For Brexit supporters, the U.K. was now a sovereign nation in charge of its own destiny. For opponents, it was an isolated and diminished country.",
      "It was, inarguably, a divided nation that had taken a leap into the dark. Five years on, people and businesses are still wrestling with the economic, social and cultural aftershocks.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been really quite profound,\u201d said political scientist Anand Menon, who heads the think-tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s changed our economy.",
      "\u201cAnd our politics has been changed quite fundamentally as well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a new division around Brexit becoming part of electoral politics.\u201d",
      "An island nation with a robust sense of its historical importance, Britain had long been an uneasy member of the EU when it held a referendum in June 2016 on whether to remain or leave. Decades of deindustrialization, followed by years of public spending cuts and high immigration, made fertile ground for the argument that Brexit would let the U.K. \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, laws and economy.",
      "Yet the result \u2014 52% to 48% in favor of leaving \u2014 came as a shock to many. Neither the Conservative government, which campaigned to stay in the EU, nor pro-Brexit campaigners had planned for the messy details of the split.",
      "The referendum was followed by years of wrangling over divorce terms between a wounded EU and a fractious U.K. that caused gridlock in Parliament and ultimately defeated Prime Minister Theresa May. She resigned in 2019 and was replaced by Boris Johnson, who vowed to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t so simple.",
      "The U.K. left without agreement on its future economic relationship with the EU, which accounted for half the country\u2019s trade. The political departure was followed by 11 months of testy negotiations on divorce terms, culminating in agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020.",
      "The bare-bones trade deal saw the U.K. leave the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union. It meant goods could move without tariffs or quotas, but brought new red tape, costs and delays for trading businesses.",
      "\u201cIt has cost us money. We are definitely slower and it\u2019s more expensive. But we\u2019ve survived,\u201d said Lars Andersen, whose London-based company, My Nametags, ships brightly colored labels for kids\u2019 clothes and school supplies to more than 150 countries.",
      "To keep trading with the EU, Andersen has had to set up a base in Ireland, through which all orders destined for EU countries must pass before being sent on. He says the hassle has been worth it, but some other small businesses he knows have stopped trading with the EU or moved manufacturing out of the U.K.",
      "Julianne Ponan, founder and CEO of allergen-free food producer Creative Nature, had a growing export business to EU countries that was devastated by Brexit. Since then she has successfully turned to markets in the Middle East and Australia, something she says has been a positive outcome of leaving the EU.",
      "Having mastered the new red tape, she is now gradually building up business with Europe again.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019ve lost four years of growth there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the sad part. We would be a lot further ahead in our journey if Brexit hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d",
      "The government\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that U.K. exports and imports will both be around 15% lower in the long run than if the U.K. had remained in the EU, and economic productivity 4% less than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Brexit supporters argue that short-term pain will be offset by Britain\u2019s new freedom to strike trade deals around the world. Since Brexit. the U.K. has signed trade agreements with countries including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.",
      "But David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, said they have not offset the hit to trade with Britain\u2019s nearest neighbors.",
      "\u201cThe big players aren\u2019t so much affected,\u201d Henig said. \u201cWe still have Airbus, we still have Scotch whisky. We still do defense, big pharmaceuticals. But the mid-size players are really struggling to keep their exporting position. And nobody new is coming in to set up.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Brexit has not played out as either supporters or opponents anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine piled on more economic disruption, and made it harder to discern the impact of Britain\u2019s EU exit on the economy.",
      "In one key area, immigration, Brexit\u2019s impact has been the opposite of what many predicted. A desire to reduce immigration was a major reason many people voted to leave the EU, yet immigration today is far higher than before Brexit because the number of visas granted for workers from around the world has soared.",
      "Meanwhile, the rise of protectionist political leaders, especially newly returned U.S. President Donald Trump, has raised the stakes for Britain, now caught between its near neighbors in Europe and its trans-Atlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U.S.",

      "Polls suggest U.K. public opinion has soured on Brexit, with a majority of people now thinking it was a mistake. But rejoining seems a distant prospect. With memories of arguments and division still raw, few people want to go through all that again.",
      "Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected in July 2024, has promised to \u201creset\u201d relations with the EU, but has ruled out rejoining the customs union or single market. He\u2019s aiming for relatively modest changes such as a making it easier for artists to tour and for professionals to have their qualifications recognized, as well as on closer cooperation on law enforcement and security.",
      "EU leaders have welcomed the change of tone from Britain, but have problems of their own amid growing populism across the continent. The U.K. is no longer a top priority.",
      "\u201cI completely understand, it\u2019s difficult to get back together after quite a harsh divorce,\u201d said Andersen, who nonetheless hopes Britain and the EU will draw closer with time. \u201cI suspect it will happen, but it will happen slowly and subtly without politicians particularly shouting about it.\u201d"

      "Fifteen Israeli hostages were released from more than 15 months of captivity in Gaza over the past two weeks",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- When Ilana Gritzewsky returned to Israel after being held captive in Gaza for 55 days in November 2023, she had so much adrenaline coursing through her body she couldn\u2019t sleep for two days.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s really over,\" Gritzewsky recalled. \"You don\u2019t know who you are or even what your name is.\u201d",
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is underway and hostages are being released in stages. But after the initial jubilation of being freed, the released captives \u2014 who have been held for more than 15 months \u2014 are likely to endure a trying reentry, based on the testimony of those who were held hostage themselves.",
      "Gritzewsky, 31, who is originally from Mexico, was kidnapped with her boyfriend from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants burst across the border, killing around 1,200 people, and kidnapping around 250 people, in an attack that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Gritzewsky was released after 55 days during the only previous ceasefire deal a year ago.",
      "More than a year later, Gritzewsky still has lingering health issues. She hasn\u2019t gained back all of the weight that she lost, she\u2019s prediabetic, and has lingering pain issues from the kidnapping, when her pelvis and jaw were broken and her leg was burned from the motorcycle exhaust. She suffered hearing loss in one ear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still not able to really take care of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think my brain has really grasped everything I\u2019ve gone through.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s acknowledges she has neglected her own recovery as she advocates tirelessly for her boyfriend\u2019s release.",
      "Fifteen hostages have been released from Gaza, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, as the current ceasefire for the that has devastated Gaza moves into its second full week. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and wide swaths of the territory have been destroyed. Hamas is expected to release small groups weekly throughout the ceasefire's initial six-week phase. There are approximately 80 hostages left in Gaza, almost half of whom Israel believes to be dead.",
      "When Gritzewsky was freed, she was able to do what she had dreamed of during her captivity: hug her mother and see her family.",
      "She was desperate for a good steak, but due to concerns about health complications spurred by eating too much or too quickly in those with prolonged vitamin and nutritional deficiencies, it took time before she could eat what she wanted.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re used to hostage conditions, so whenever you get food you put some to the side. You ask if you can go to the bathroom, if you can sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "The leadup to her release was traumatic. Gritzewsky said she was told four times she was being released, only to be brought to a different location. Each time her transfer didn\u2019t lead to freedom.",
      "\u201cI thought this was going to be my life forever, that I was going to be a doll for Hamas terrorists, I\u2019d end up having babies with them, I wanted to just smash my head into the wall and die,\u201d she said.",
      "Watching the released hostages enter Israel over the past week was a \u201cstorm of emotions,\u201d said Gritzewsky.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s finally starting. Our heroes are starting to come out, and they\u2019re leaving on their own two feet,\u201d she said. But there\u2019s also uncertainty about whether the ceasefire will hold. Gritzewsky\u2019s boyfriend, Matan Zangauker, 25, is not on the list of 33 hostages expected to be released in the first stage of the ceasefire.",
      "The hostages stay in the hospital for several days as they undergo a battery of tests to determine next steps. All fifteen of the hostages released over the past two weeks returned in stable condition, but were suffering from \u201cmild starvation\u201d and vitamin deficiencies, according to Dr. Ami Banov, an Israeli military doctor who has treated the released hostages. He said many of them suffered injuries in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack and that the medical care they received was nonexistent or poor quality. Many of them still have pieces of shrapnel in their body.",
      "Some of the women who have returned recently said they were held in tunnels and deprived of sunlight for at least eight months straight, said Banov, which can lead to major vision or skin issues. Those who were held in captivity with others seem to be faring better mentally than hostages who were kept alone, he said.",
      "Each hostage is accompanied by a dedicated team of doctors, nurses, specialists, psychologists, and social workers, medical officials said.",
      "One of the most important things is allowing the returned hostage to lead the recovery, explained Ofrit Shapira, a psychoanalyst who heads a group of health professionals treating freed hostages, their families, and survivors of the Oct. 7 attack. Everyone treating them must ask their permission for each little thing, from turning off a light to changing bedsheets to carrying out medical tests.",
      "\u201cThey took everything away that defines them as humans, especially privacy and autonomy, and it\u2019s a challenge to help them regain that,\u201d she said.",
      "Doctors refer to this process as \u201cgrounding\u201d said Banov, who likened it to a decompression process, gradually helping the hostages understand they have regained control over such decisions as what to eat, what to wear and where and when to meet their families.",
      "\u201cWe feel obligated to give them the option to do whatever they feel right,\u201d he said. But he said everything is being done in \u201cvery small steps.\u201d",
      "Adina Moshe was freed after 49 days in captivity. In a first-person account on the Israeli news site N12, she said some hostages will return knowing little about any destruction to their homes or the fates of their loved ones. They will remain suspicious of people and have to contend with aggressive media. Any improvement in their condition can easily reverse, she said.",
      "\u201cIn their souls, they will continue to remain in the tunnels for a long time,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Avichai Brodutch, whose wife and three children were kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Kfar Aza will never forget waiting for them to return in the hospital and the moment he saw them for the first time.",
      "\u201cThe elevator doors opened and I got my family, reborn,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodutch said the return was both overwhelming and joyful because he feared his family had been killed during Hamas' initial attack. He said they returned thin and lice-ridden.",
      "The physical issues were quickly treated. But Brodutch said captivity left a lasting imprint on his family's mental well-being. Each day, he hears a new story about something that happened in Gaza. They relive Oct. 7 over and over, and the challenges remain largest for his wife, Hagar, who cared for their three children and a neighbor's child, Abigail Edan, then 3, while in captivity.",
      "\"It\u2019s going to take a long time to repair the wounds of the soul,\u201d he said.",

      "A vermilion dot on the forehead is one of India\u2019s most widely accepted Hindu cultural insignias",
      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- The pilgrims come and go as strangers. They march like a sea of people, walking toward the spot where they take holy baths, drawn by the hope that the bathing would bring them salvation.",
      "But when they leave \u2014 believing their sins have been cleansed by the redemptive bath \u2014 they leave with one thing in common: their foreheads display a sacred stroke of color.",
      "This sacred stroke, called tilak, is ubiquitous to the millions of Hindu pilgrims attending the Maha Kumbh festival in India's northern Prayagraj city, where faithful gather at the spot where the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers converge. Applied by Hindu priests using sandalwood paste, turmeric and sacred ashes, these strokes represent divine connections in Hinduism, with each type having its own symbolic association with a deity.",
      "The festival, where a stampede killed 30 people Wednesday, has historically embraced diversity in the ancient traditions of Hinduism. They allow plurality in belief and ritual practice of faith of Hindus, who comprise 80% of India\u2019s population. The markings worn on the foreheads cut across castes and classes, many of them being unique identifiers of the numerous religious communities, all under the umbrella of Hinduism.",
      "Hundreds of Hindu priests at the festival paint them on the foreheads of the pilgrims. Many consider it a selfless service to their religion \u2014 without which the pilgrimage is incomplete.",
      "\u201cWash away your sins all you want, and do all the good deeds, but if you don\u2019t put a tilak on your forehead after bathing, everything goes to a waste,\u201d says priest Shiv Kumar Pandey.",
      "A vermilion dot on the forehead is one of India\u2019s most widely accepted Hindu cultural insignias. But at the festival, where millions are flocking to pray and bathe at the confluence of India\u2019s holy rivers, it morphs into a major display of Hinduism in various forms and designs.",
      "Some pilgrims wear it in the form of three yellow horizontal lines. Others prefer two vertical white ones with a red or yellow stripe in the center. Then there is the large red vertical mark, or names of various Hindu gods written in Hindi and English.",
      "Hindu priest Pandey, who sits cross-legged at a nearby stretch of the riverbank, can apply all of them.",
      "For every pilgrim who visits him, he dips his fingers in the yellow vermillion paste and spreads a stroke on their forehead. He then uses a steel stamp to mark them with a symbol of the Hindu god they prefer \u2014 from Lord Shiva, the powerful Hindu god of destruction, to Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered gods.",
      "The pilgrims give Pandey money, from one rupee coins to a 50-rupee note, small pouches of rice and pulses \u2014 even, at times, blankets. In return, he places his hand on their heads as they bow to seek his blessings.",
      "According to Hindu scriptures, the tilak is supposed to \u201cprotect and purify the mind as well as the body,\u201d Pandey says.",
      "The Maha Kumbh festival began on Jan. 13 and continues over six weeks. About 400 million people \u2014 most of them from the country\u2019s vast rural and remote locations \u2014 were expected to attend the festival where Hindu faith and spirituality reigns supreme.",
      "Most pilgrims believe that a dip in the holy waters has to be followed by having a tilak pasted on their foreheads by a Hindu priest.",
      "Sushila Chauhan sat quietly a short distance from where she had taken the holy dip, as hundreds of other pilgrims waded in the river, splashing the murky water over their heads and bodies, chanting Hindu prayers. She explained why the words \u201cMahakal\u201d \u2014 a fierce manifestation of Hindu god Shiva \u2014 were pasted on her forehead.",
      "\u201cBecause he is the god of the three worlds,\u201d Chauhan says, referring to the deity's association with creation, preservation and destruction.",
      "Chauhan came to the festival along with 52 other family members. With the sun low in the sky, a priest shuffled along the riverbank, his bare feet padding on the sand, and applied tilak on their foreheads one by one.",
      "\u201cIt gives you concentration, peace of mind and satisfaction,\u201d Chauhan says. \u201cIt is also a symbol of our religion.\u201d",

      "A landslide has engulfed a group of mainly women gold miners in Mali, killing several of them",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- A landslide engulfed a group of mainly women gold miners in Mali, killing several of them, the governor\u2019s office of the Koulikoro region in the West African country said Thursday.",
      "In a statement broadcast on Mali\u2019s national television, Koulikoro's governor, Col. Lamine Kapory Sanogo, said \u201cthe women (gold miners) were numerous at an excavation in search of gold, and the excavation was surrounded by a dike that gave way and water entered with mud and engulfed the women.\u201d",
      "The office of the governor said the landslide at the artisanal gold mine in southern Mali happened on Wednesday. It said several of the miners were killed but did not provide a number.",
      "This is not the first time such accidents have occurred at a gold mine in Mali, which is known as one of the three gold producing countries in Africa. In January last year, an unregulated gold mine collapsed in Mali, killing more than 70 people near the capital Bamako.",
      "In recent years, there have been concerns that profits from unregulated mining in northern Mali could benefit extremists active in that part of the country.",

    "story": [
      "In 2012, when M23 rebels appeared poised to seize control of a major city in eastern Congo, western countries suspended aid to put pressure on Rwanda to withdraw its support",
      "When Rwanda-backed rebels seized control of eastern Congo\u2019s strategic city of Goma this week, it prompted a flurry of declarations condemning Rwanda from the U.N. and western nations, including the United States, France and the U.K.",
      "Yet, the international community has stopped short of putting financial pressure on Kigali to withdraw its support for the rebels as happened when they took Goma in 2012.",
      "The contrast has to do with the country\u2019s evolving stature both in Africa and the West, where officials have long admired fourth-term President Paul Kagame for his role in uplifting Rwanda in the aftermath of genocide, analysts and diplomats said. They point to Rwanda\u2019s shrewd branding, efforts to make itself more indispensable militarily and economically and divided attention spans of countries preoccupied with wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cSo far there has been significantly less international pressure than there was in 2012 for various reasons, including the new administration in the White House, other ongoing international crises and Rwanda\u2019s role in continental peacekeeping and security operations,\u201d said Ben Shepherd, a fellow Chatham House\u2019s Africa Program.",
      "Kagame\u2019s efforts to transform his small east African nation into a political and economic juggernaut, they say, has made the international community more reluctant to pressure Rwanda.",
      "That's been true when Kagame has abolished term limits and waged a campaign of repression against his opponents at home. It\u2019s been true as he\u2019s backed rebels fighting Congolese forces across the country\u2019s border. And it's remained true despite the fact that Rwanda\u2019s economy is still heavily reliant on foreign aid, including from the United States, the World Bank and the European Union.",
      "The United States disbursed $180 million in foreign aid to Rwanda in 2023. The World Bank's International Development Association provided nearly $221 million the same year. And in the years ahead, the European Union has pledged to invest over $900 million in Rwanda under the Global Gateway strategy, its response to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "In 2012, that aid was a key source of leverage as the western powers pressured Rwanda to end its role in the fighting. Donor countries withheld aid and the World Bank threatened to. Only a few nations, including the U.K. and Germany, have implied Rwanda\u2019s involvement could jeopardize the flow of aid.",
      "But today, the international community has fewer means to influence Rwanda as M23 advances southward from Goma. The United States suspended military aid to Rwanda in 2012 in the months before it seized Goma but can't make the same threats after suspending it again last year. And since taking office, President Donald Trump has since frozen the vast majority of foreign aid, stripping the United States of the means to use it to leverage any country in particular.",
      "The Rwanda-backed M23 group is one of about 100 armed factions vying for a foothold in eastern Congo in one of Africa\u2019s longest conflicts, displacing 4.5 million people and creating what the U.N. called \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.\"",
      "A July 2024 report from a U.N. group of experts estimated at least 4,000 Rwandan troops were active across the Congolese border. More have been observed pouring into Congo this week.",
      "Kagame has claimed that M23 rebels in eastern Congo merely want to defend Tutsis from the same Hutu extremists who carried out the genocide that killed some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus without intervention from the international community.",
      "That failure and the resulting guilt informed a generation of politicians\u2019 thinking about Rwanda.",
      "\u201cRwanda\u2019s justifications and references to the genocide continue to play to the West\u2019s perception of it,\u201d said South Africa-based risk analyst Daniel Van Dalen. \u201cThere\u2019s always been apprehension to take any decisive action against Rwanda politically or economically.\u201d",
      "But today, there are other factors at play.",
      "Set on transforming the country into the \u201cSingapore of Africa,\u201d Kagame has modernized Rwanda\u2019s infrastructure, raised life expectancy rates and lured companies like Volkswagen and leagues like the NBA to open up shop in-country. Donors and foreign correspondents often profess wonder at Kigali\u2019s clean streets, upscale restaurants and women-majority parliament.",
      "The transformation has won Rwanda admiration from throughout the world, including in Africa, where leaders see Rwanda\u2019s trajectory as a model to draw lessons from.",
      "\u201cThe history of genocide still plays a role, but Kagame has very cleverly set up relationships with western capitals and established himself as a beacon of stability and economic growth in the region,\u201d said a European diplomat, who did not want to be named because he was not allowed to speak on the matter publicly. \u201cSome capitals still don\u2019t want to see the truth.\u201d",
      "Rwanda contributes more personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations than all but two countries. It is a key supplier of troops deployed to Central African Republic, where the United States worries about growing Russian influence. The country has also agreed deals to deploy its army to fight extremists in northern Mozambique, where France\u2019s Total Energies is developing an offshore gas project.",
      "\u201cThey have leveraged two things very well, which is their international diplomacy and their military prowess,\u201d said Jason Stearns, a political scientist and Congo expert at Canada's Simon Fraser University. \u201cThey\u2019ve just been very good at making themselves useful.\u201d",
      "A decade ago, Rwanda was primarily exporting agricultural products like coffee and tea. But it has since emerged as a key partner for western nations competing with China for access to natural resources in east Africa.",
      "In addition to gold and tin, Rwanda is a top exporter of tantalum, a mineral used to manufacture semiconductors. While it does not publish data on the volumes of minerals it mines, last year the U.S. State Department said Rwanda exported more minerals than it mined, citing a U.N. report. And just last month, Congo filed lawsuits against Apple\u2019s subsidiaries in France and Belgium, accusing Rwanda of using minerals sourced in eastern Congo.",
      "Yet still, the European Union has signed an agreement with Kigali, opening the door to importing critical minerals from Rwanda. The deal sparked outrage from activists who criticized the lack of safeguards regarding sourcing of the minerals, and accused Brussels of fueling the conflict in eastern Congo.",
      "The EU pushed back, saying that the deal was in early stages and that it was \u201cworking out the practicalities\u201d on tracing and reporting minerals from Rwanda.",
      "But even if the West stepped up its response, it has less leverage than in 2012, analysts said. Kagame invested in relationships with non-Western partners, such as China and the United Arab Emirates, which is now the country\u2019s top trade partner. Rwanda also deepened its ties with the African nations that took much more decisive action to defuse the crisis in 2012.",
      "\u201cWe are waiting to see how South Africans and Angolans react,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cThere was diplomatic pressure in 2012, but it only changed things because it came alongside African forces deployed in the U.N. intervention brigade.\u201d",

      "Being the destination for the first overseas visit by the top U.S. diplomat would have been big for Panama in any case, but Rubio comes as the emissary of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly suggested the U.S. retake the Panama Canal.",

      "Mulino tried to downplay the tension at his weekly press conference Thursday. He spoke of wanting to clarify confusion about China\u2019s role in the canal \u2014 a Hong Kong consortium manages ports at both ends, but Panama controls the canal \u2013 and blamed a predecessor for the long-term concession made for control of the ports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I can\u2019t negotiate,\u201d Mulino said when asked about returning the canal to U.S. control. \u201cThat is done. The canal belongs to Panama.\u201d",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I want is to clear all the garbage from the path, clean the table and be able to speak with the United States and very frankly\u201d about issues including immigration, security and the fight against drug trafficking, Mulino said.",

      "\u201cIt was a fishing vessel, which is not typically found in the Caribbean,\u201d Police Commissioner James Sutton told The Associated Press. \u201cWe are not certain, but we believe that this vessel originated off the West African coast.\u201d",
      "Sutton said officials now face the difficult task of determining the exact number of bodies and identifying them. The advanced state of decomposition, he said, has made it difficult.",
      "This is the first such discovery in recent memory in the twin-island nation.",

      "McDonald\u2019s said Friday it is changing \u2014 but not eliminating \u2014 a scholarship program for Latino students after it was sued by a group that opposes affirmative action.",
      "McDonald\u2019s HACER National Scholarship Program, which was founded in 1985, awards college scholarships to students with at least one Latino parent. The program has awarded more than $33 million in scholarships to more than 17,000 students.",
      "On Jan. 12, the American Alliance for Equal Rights sued McDonald's over the HACER program. The alliance, which challenges programs that use race or ethnicity as a factor in their decisions, is run by Edward Blum, the conservative activist who also successfully challenged affirmative action programs in college admissions.",
      "On Friday, McDonald\u2019s said it reached a settlement with the American Alliance for Equal Rights that will allow it to consider this year\u2019s applicants. The Chicago company said more than 3,000 students have already applied for this year's scholarships.",

      "Canada and Mexico say they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary now that the White House says the U.S. will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from them this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues for the federal government.",
      "\u201cStarting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by the president.\u201d",
      "The tariffs carry both political and economic risks for Trump, who is just two weeks into his second term. Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could tamp down inflation, but the possibility of tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, auto, lumber and agricultural sectors.",
      "Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts.",
      "The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day.",
      "Trump has previously stated a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country.",
      "Shortly after Leavitt spoke, the S&P 500 stock index sold off and largely erased its gains on the day.",
      "Both Canada and Mexico have said they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary, which in turn could trigger a wider trade conflict that economic analyses say could hurt growth and further accelerate inflation.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada is ready is a respond if Trump goes ahead with the tariffs, but he did not give details.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\u201d",
      "Trudeau said tariffs would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for the U.S, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Trudeau reiterated that less than 1% of the fentanyl and illegal crossings into the U.S. come from Canada.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Trump\u2019s team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \u201cPlan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\u201cNow it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "A study this month by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China \u201cwould damage all the economies involved, including the US.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cFor Mexico,\u2019\u2019 the study said, \u201ca 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the US \u2014 directly contradicting another Trump administration priority.\u2019\u2019",

      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey",
      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump's early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey.",
      "Shell told The Associated Press it is writing off the project, citing increased competition, delays and a changing market.",
      "\u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email.",
      "Shell co-owns the large Atlantic Shores project, which has most of its permits and would generate enough power for 1 million homes if both of two phases were completed. That\u2019s enough for one-third of New Jersey households.",
      "It's unclear whether Shell's decision kills the project \u2014 partner EDF-RE Offshore Development says it remains committed to Atlantic Shores.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order singling out offshore wind for contempt with a temporary halt on all lease sales in federal waters and a pause on approvals, permits and loans. Perhaps most of interest to Shell, the order directs administration officials to review existing offshore wind energy leases and identify any legal reasons to terminate them.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. They are considered by experts to be an essential part of addressing climate change because they can take the place of fossil fuel plants, if paired with battery storage. New Jersey has set a goal of generating 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2035.",
      "The Biden administration approved plans to build the Atlantic Shores project in two phases in October, but construction has not begun. Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF, said the partners are facing significant uncertainty about their lease, and other developers are watching what happens with Atlantic Shores closely. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncertain territory here,\u201d he added.",
      "Offshore wind foes, who are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey, celebrated Shell\u2019s withdrawal. Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, helped the Trump team draft the executive order. He said Shell\u2019s decision is a \u201cbig win\u201d for New Jersey\u2019s coastline and economy but \u201cthis fight is not over.\u201d",
      "Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, said that without Shell's financial backing, it appears the project is \u201cdead in the water.\u201d",
      "Shell is writing off a nearly $1 billion investment. It announced its decision on Thursday, as it reported a 16% decline in full-year earnings of $23.7 billion from $28.3 billion. Most of its business is oil and gas.",
      "Danish wind developer Orsted was close to beginning work on two offshore wind farms in New Jersey but scrapped the project in Oct. 2023 after deciding it would not be economical.",
      "A lot of clean energy is cheap now, but offshore wind is still among the most expensive. That can make these projects less attractive to investors, absent strong policy support, said Coco Zhang, vice president for environmental, social and governance research at ING.",
      "\u201cThe potential uncertainty that the executive order has brought to the market, it cannot be ignored,\u201d she said.",
      "The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals to deploy offshore wind energy, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects.",

    "story": [
      "An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose slightly last month, the latest sign that some consumer prices remain stubbornly elevated, even as inflation is cooling in fits and starts",
      "WASHINGTON -- An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose slightly last month, while some underlying prices pressures showed signs of easing.",
      "The latest inflation figures arrive as President Donald Trump has threatened to impose big import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico, potentially affecting everything from autos to avocados, which could push prices higher in the coming months.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.6% in December from a year earlier, up from a 2.4% annual pace in November and the third straight increase. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices increased 2.8% compared with a year ago, the same as in November and October.",
      "There were some positive signs in Wednesday\u2019s report, however. When measured in shorter time frames, inflation is slowing: In December, core prices ticked up 0.2% from the previous month, a pace that is nearly consistent with the Fed\u2019s annual target. Economists \u2014 and Fed officials \u2014 pay close attention to core prices because they provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures arrive just two days after Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, decided to pause their interest rate cuts in part because inflation has largely been stuck at about 2.5%, above their 2% target, for the past six months.",
      "In the past three months, core prices have risen at an annual rate of just 2.2%, down from 2.6% in November.",
      "Many businesses raise prices at the start of the year, which could push up inflation a bit when January's figures are released next month. But the Fed's preferred gauge should decline steadily in the next few months, economists say, as higher inflation readings early last year fall out of the year-over-year figures.",
      "\u201cBeyond that, however, the growing risk that Trump will impose tariffs a little earlier than we are assuming presents an upside risk to inflation,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm, said in a written note.",
      "Overall inflation climbed 0.3% in December from the previous month, driven higher by a jump in gas prices. Monthly increases at that level, if they continued, would exceed the Fed's target.",
      "The Commerce Department's report also showed consumer spending rose a healthy 0.7% in December from the previous month, fueled in part by steady wage gains and higher stock prices and home values. Incomes rose 0.4%, the government said. With spending outpacing incomes, the savings rate fell to 3.8% from 4.1%.",
      "Americans specifically ramped up spending on goods, such as electronics and furniture, likely a sign that consumers are buying more manufactured products, many of which are imported, before the potential imposition of tariffs that Trump has threatened to implement.",
      "Underlying trends point to lower inflation ahead. Apartment rental prices and other housing costs are slowly moderating. And a sluggish labor market has meant wage growth has slipped, which means companies are under less pressure to raise prices to offset higher labor costs.",
      "\u201cWe seem to be set up for further progress,\u201d Powell said Wednesday at a news conference, referring to inflation. \u201cBut being \u2018seem to set up for' it is one thing, having it is another. So we're going to want to see further progress on inflation.\u201d",
      "Until then, Powell suggested, the Fed is likely to keep its key rate at about 4.3%, down a full percentage point from a two-decade peak last year before three cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed expects higher borrowing costs will weigh on spending and bring inflation down further.",
      "Consumers, meanwhile, powered strong growth in the final three months of last year, when the economy expanded at a solid 2.3% annual rate. Growth was stronger in the July-September quarter, at 3.1%, but the fourth-quarter expansion was held back by a sharp reduction in business inventories, which should reverse in coming quarters."

      "The company said in a brief statement Thursday that its cash needs over the next several years for things like litigation and debt refinancing were big parts of the decision to suspend the dividend.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the drugstore chain of filling millions of prescriptions without a legitimate purpose, including some for dangerous amounts of opioids.",
      "In September, the company said it would pay $106 million to settle separate litigation over false payment claims.",

      "But he added that markets frequently see a dividend suspension as a positive sign initially because the company recognizes it has a problem and is taking a step to correct it.",
      "The company says it has paid cash dividends every quarter since 1933, a streak stretching more than 90 years or nearly 370 straight quarters.",
      "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., based in Deerfield, Illinois, were down more than 11% to $10.16 in premarket trading."

      "The tariffs would also invite retaliation. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has already vowed to counterpunch by pulling American alcohol off store shelves in the Canadian province \u2013 no idle threat; Canada is the world\u2019s No. 2 market for America\u2019s distilled spirits (behind the 27-nation European Union).",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to blow up the trade agreement he himself negotiated with America\u2019s neighbors in his first term. His U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2013 \u201cthe fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law,\u2019\u2019 Trump once declared -- was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade, giving businesses the confidence to make investments.",
      "But when it comes to the self-proclaimed \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 Trump and his passion for plastering taxes on foreign goods, nothing is predictable, and nothing is ever really settled.",
      "\u201cTariffs at those levels and at that scope would effectively destroy the agreement that Trump himself negotiated and always brags about,\u2019\u2019 said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "The president says the 25% levies are designed to pressure America\u2019s two neighbors to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Michael Robinet of S&P Global Mobility and many other analysts suspect the tariff threat is also designed to get Canada and Mexico to go along with America\u2019s demands for changes to the USMCA when it comes up for renewal next year.",
      "Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global, said he doubts that Trump will go ahead with 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports \u2013 what he calls a \u201cshock-to-the-system\u2019\u2019 approach that would freeze the North American economy in a \u201cTariff Winter.\u2019\u2019 Instead, Robinet said, Trump might postpone or phase in the tariffs or initially exempt some industries to show Canada and Mexico how much worse things could get if he doesn\u2019t get his way.",
      "Trump pressured Mexico and Canada into agreeing to the USMCA five years ago, partly to narrow the United States\u2019 big trade deficit \u2013 the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys.",
      "It hasn\u2019t worked out that way.",
      "The U.S. deficit in the trade of goods of Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023 (the last full year for which numbers are available). That is partly because Mexico has replaced China, locked in an ongoing trade war with the United States, as the source of many U.S. imports \u2013 furniture, textiles, shoes, laptops, computer servers.",
      "The trade gap in goods with Canada has ballooned, too: From $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. The deficit largely reflects America\u2019s imports of Canadian energy.",
      "\u201cThe USMCA has not met the goals that Trump set forth for it. Our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico is bigger than it was, considerably,\u2019\u2019 said Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime critic of America\u2019s free trade pacts. \u201cA lot of jobs have been offshored to Mexico since USMCA.\u2019\u2019",
      "When the USMCA comes up for renewal next year, the U.S. is expected to press for rules that would do more to encourage factories to produce in the United States. And it could seek a crackdown on Chinese goods being sent through Mexico to the United States to evade tariffs that Trump and President Joe Biden imposed on Beijing.",
      "The United States now does far more business \u2013 exports and imports alike \u2013 with both Canada and Mexico than it does with China. In 2023, U.S. trade of both goods and services with Canada and Mexico came to more than $1.8 trillion, compared with $643 billion with China. Because of USMCA \u2013 and the regional trade deal it replaced in 2020 \u2013 most products cross the region\u2019s borders tariff-free.",
      "The threatened 25% tariffs are causing heartburn in corporate boardrooms. If Trump goes ahead with his threat, tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico\u2019s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada\u2019s, according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.",
      "And no one knows if Trump will really pull the trigger or how long the tariffs would stay in place if he does. \u201cIt\u2019s really thrown industry into this turmoil of anxiety,\u201d said trade lawyer Chandri Navarro, senior counsel at Baker & McKenzie. \u201cWhat industry likes is certainty. You\u2019re making production decisions, supply chain decisions, purchasing decisions five years out.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs as a fix-it for most of what ails the economy. He says they raise money for cuts in income and corporate taxes, encourage companies to move production to the United States and offer useful leverage in pressuring other countries to make concessions on trade and other issues.",
      "Trump administration officials also say critics of potential tariffs shouldn't view them in isolation, arguing that their other policies, including lowering taxes and easing regulations, will strengthen the economy.",
      "Companies are scrambling to prepare. Some bought goods and shipped them to the United States ahead of time to beat the tariffs. Others are calculating how much of the cost they can pass along to their customers. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to impact a lot of consumers,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Evans, co-founder and CEO of Fictiv, a San Francisco company that helps clients manage their supply chains in plastics and metals. \u201cWe saw this in his first term. A tariff isn\u2019t fully absorbed by the companies.\u2019\u2019",
      "Canada and Mexico are bracing, too. Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister who represented Canada in USMCA negotiations, has called for retaliation if Trump moves ahead with tariffs. \u201cBeing smart means retaliating where it hurts,\u201d said Freeland, who is running to replace prime minister Justin Trudeau. \u201cOur counterpunch must be dollar-for-dollar \u2014 and it must be precisely and painfully targeted: Florida orange growers, Wisconsin dairy farmers, Michigan dishwasher manufacturers, and much more.\u201d",
      "Likewise, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised in November that \u201cfor every tariff, there will be a response in kind.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Texas company earned $7.61 billion, or $1.72 per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31. It earned $7.63 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the prior-year period.",
      "Removing one time costs and charges, earnings were $1.67 per share.",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt freeze of U.S. foreign aid is sending shockwaves through Eastern Europe, leaving pro-democracy groups, independent media, civil society initiatives and local governments scrambling to make ends meet in a region often defined by rivalries between East and West.",
      "The U.S. State Department said that the 90-day freeze aims to root out waste and block so-called woke programs to expose U.S.-funded activities \u201cthat run contrary to our national interests\u201d \u2014 as Trump aggressively rolls out his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "Eastern Europe has been a longtime geopolitical battleground where Western foreign policy interests often collide with those of Moscow or Beijing.",
      "Many fear the cessation of U.S. funds could expose Washington's allies \u2014 and create a vacuum that its foes could gladly seek to fill.",
      "\u201cIn Moldova\u2019s case, foreign donor support is vital to balancing the media landscape,\" says Oxana Greadcenco, the director of independent media platform Moldova.org. \u201cMany television networks and media institutions are funded by Russia so there needs to be a counterbalance ... This is an unprecedented situation, but we are trying not to panic.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, informed her that grants officially ended on Jan. 24 and they aren\u2019t allowed to spend any remaining funds in their accounts. This week, Greadcenco promoted their online Patreon campaign, which garnered 135 new backers in two days, which should cover salaries for the platform\u2019s 16-strong staff through March, she said.",
      "\u201cWe did not expect it to impact Moldova so severely, as we thought there would only be a partial cut in funds,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \"Being aware of how much Moldova depends on U.S. funds, not just NGOs and the press but also local municipalities, many public institutions \u2026 this is a shock for everyone.\"",
      "Since the 1990s, USAID has invested several billion dollars in countries like Moldova, Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 all former communist countries with aspirations of joining the European Union.",
      "In these countries, USAID money has promoted democratic institutions and reforms, aided infrastructure and energy security projects, bolstered businesses and economies, and supported a significant number of nongovernmental organizations and independent media platforms. The agency says it \u201ctailors its approach to each country\u2019s unique challenges and opportunities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that we have democracy in Moldova, in part thanks to American financial support,\u201d Valeriu Pasa, the chairman of the Chisinau-based think-tank WatchDog, said in a statement on Wednesday. He added that the U.S. benefits \"from us being more democratic and developed, ensuring we don\u2019t turn into a Russian or Chinese colony.\u201d",
      "The wide-ranging effects of the USAID spending freeze spanning different sectors highlight how critical the funds are to the region.",
      "Sytrime Dervisholi, executive director of the Prefabricated Construction Association of Kosovo, says the halted USAID funds will adversely affect her association\u2019s ability to provide technical assistance to member companies that require vocational education and training, and access to grants.",
      "\u201cKosovo, but also our association \u2026 is dependent on foreign aid, mostly on U.S. aid,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we really do hope that this measure will be \u2026 canceled after 90 days,\u201d when the funding reviews by U.S. officials have concluded.",
      "Safet Gerxhaliu, an independent economic analyst in Kosovo, also believes the USAID freeze could have \u201ca very negative impact\u201d on the country\u2019s future, affecting everything from the government to the private sector and education.",
      "\u201cI do believe that the impact is very bad, because those measures come at the same time that Kosovo is under sanctions from the European community,\u201d he said. Brussels froze some funding to Kosovo in 2023 following a series of clashes with ethnic Serb minorities.",
      "Although Serbia obtained EU candidate status in 2012, the Balkan nation is also a key ally of Russia and China in Europe. Under the government of populist President Aleksandar Vucic, reforms in areas such as strengthening the rule of law and tackling corruption have been slow, and the USAID suspension could further hamper progress.",
      "\u201cWe currently have a USAID project about public financing. Training for local NGOs regarding following of public finances,\u201d Nemanja Nenadic from Transparency International organization in Serbia, told the AP. \u201cThis has been put on hold.\u201d",
      "For the Promo-LEX Association, a longtime pro-democracy and human rights NGO in Moldova, USAID funds are vital since they account for about 75-80% of its projects, which include monitoring elections, political financing and parliamentary oversight.",
      "\u201cAll USAID-funded activities have been put on hold. Without immediate alternative support, these crucial activities may not continue at the same scale or effectiveness,\u201d said Ion Manole, the association\u2019s executive director. \u201cGiven previous Russian interference \u2014 through illicit campaign funding, political corruption, and disinformation \u2014 our observation mission is essential to ensuring electoral transparency.\"",
      "Moldova will hold a pivotal parliamentary election this fall which comes after the pro-Western government accused Russia of meddling in two key votes last year \u2014 including backing a vast vote-buying scheme in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWithout resources, we cannot deploy long-term observers, conduct election-day monitoring, or track foreign interference effectively,\" Manole said. \u201cA change to an anti-Western government could affect Moldova\u2019s European path and ... significantly destabilize the whole of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain hopeful that the U.S. government\u2019s evaluation process will allow programs like ours to resume,\u201d he said, adding that his NGO is already seeking alternative funding, mainly from European donors.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that any suspension of aid \u201cgives Russia an unnecessary opportunity to exploit and benefit further from Moldova\u2019s weaknesses, which the lack of USAID funding would exacerbate.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoscow would therefore have greater abilities to derail Chisinau from its European Union integration course,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilarly, cutting funding to independent news outlets makes it more difficult for journalists to hold corrupt politicians \u2014 many of whom have connections to Russia \u2014 accountable and therefore weakens Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and institutional independence.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has cast the aid freeze as an accountability quest to justify American spending abroad. Beyond support for Ukraine in recent years, the U.S. is spending about $40 billion in foreign aid annually, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "Greadcenco of the Moldova.org news platform hopes that other international partners will consider stepping in to stem a potential longer-term shortfall.",
      "\u201cThese funds are vital to keeping Moldova afloat,\u201d she said. \u201cI dread to think what the complete cessation of these funds would mean for our country.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Five years ago Friday, two crowds of people gathered near Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 some with Union Jacks and cheers, others European Union flags and tears.",
      "On Jan. 31, 2020 at 11 p.m. London time \u2013 midnight at EU headquarters in Brussels \u2014 the U.K. officially left the bloc after almost five decades of membership that had brought free movement and free trade between Britain and 27 other European countries.",
      "For Brexit supporters, the U.K. was now a sovereign nation in charge of its own destiny. For opponents, it was an isolated and diminished country.",
      "It was, inarguably, a divided nation that had taken a leap into the dark. Five years on, people and businesses are still wrestling with the economic, social and cultural aftershocks.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been really quite profound,\u201d said political scientist Anand Menon, who heads the think-tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s changed our economy.",
      "\u201cAnd our politics has been changed quite fundamentally as well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a new division around Brexit becoming part of electoral politics.\u201d",
      "An island nation with a robust sense of its historical importance, Britain had long been an uneasy member of the EU when it held a referendum in June 2016 on whether to remain or leave. Decades of deindustrialization, followed by years of public spending cuts and high immigration, made fertile ground for the argument that Brexit would let the U.K. \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, laws and economy.",
      "Yet the result \u2014 52% to 48% in favor of leaving \u2014 came as a shock to many. Neither the Conservative government, which campaigned to stay in the EU, nor pro-Brexit campaigners had planned for the messy details of the split.",
      "The referendum was followed by years of wrangling over divorce terms between a wounded EU and a fractious U.K. that caused gridlock in Parliament and ultimately defeated Prime Minister Theresa May. She resigned in 2019 and was replaced by Boris Johnson, who vowed to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t so simple.",
      "The U.K. left without agreement on its future economic relationship with the EU, which accounted for half the country\u2019s trade. The political departure was followed by 11 months of testy negotiations on divorce terms, culminating in agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020.",
      "The bare-bones trade deal saw the U.K. leave the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union. It meant goods could move without tariffs or quotas, but brought new red tape, costs and delays for trading businesses.",
      "\u201cIt has cost us money. We are definitely slower and it\u2019s more expensive. But we\u2019ve survived,\u201d said Lars Andersen, whose London-based company, My Nametags, ships brightly colored labels for kids\u2019 clothes and school supplies to more than 150 countries.",
      "To keep trading with the EU, Andersen has had to set up a base in Ireland, through which all orders destined for EU countries must pass before being sent on. He says the hassle has been worth it, but some other small businesses he knows have stopped trading with the EU or moved manufacturing out of the U.K.",
      "Julianne Ponan, founder and CEO of allergen-free food producer Creative Nature, had a growing export business to EU countries that was devastated by Brexit. Since then she has successfully turned to markets in the Middle East and Australia, something she says has been a positive outcome of leaving the EU.",
      "Having mastered the new red tape, she is now gradually building up business with Europe again.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019ve lost four years of growth there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the sad part. We would be a lot further ahead in our journey if Brexit hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d",
      "The government\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that U.K. exports and imports will both be around 15% lower in the long run than if the U.K. had remained in the EU, and economic productivity 4% less than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Brexit supporters argue that short-term pain will be offset by Britain\u2019s new freedom to strike trade deals around the world. Since Brexit. the U.K. has signed trade agreements with countries including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.",
      "But David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, said they have not offset the hit to trade with Britain\u2019s nearest neighbors.",
      "\u201cThe big players aren\u2019t so much affected,\u201d Henig said. \u201cWe still have Airbus, we still have Scotch whisky. We still do defense, big pharmaceuticals. But the mid-size players are really struggling to keep their exporting position. And nobody new is coming in to set up.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Brexit has not played out as either supporters or opponents anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine piled on more economic disruption, and made it harder to discern the impact of Britain\u2019s EU exit on the economy.",
      "In one key area, immigration, Brexit\u2019s impact has been the opposite of what many predicted. A desire to reduce immigration was a major reason many people voted to leave the EU, yet immigration today is far higher than before Brexit because the number of visas granted for workers from around the world has soared.",
      "Meanwhile, the rise of protectionist political leaders, especially newly returned U.S. President Donald Trump, has raised the stakes for Britain, now caught between its near neighbors in Europe and its trans-Atlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U.S.",

      "Polls suggest U.K. public opinion has soured on Brexit, with a majority of people now thinking it was a mistake. But rejoining seems a distant prospect. With memories of arguments and division still raw, few people want to go through all that again.",
      "Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected in July 2024, has promised to \u201creset\u201d relations with the EU, but has ruled out rejoining the customs union or single market. He\u2019s aiming for relatively modest changes such as a making it easier for artists to tour and for professionals to have their qualifications recognized, as well as on closer cooperation on law enforcement and security.",
      "EU leaders have welcomed the change of tone from Britain, but have problems of their own amid growing populism across the continent. The U.K. is no longer a top priority.",

      "More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continued, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. The officials were not authorized to discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

      "Investigators have already recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the American Airlines plane that collided with an Army helicopter as the plane was landing Wednesday night at Ronald Reagan National Airport next to Washington, D.C. Officials are scrutinizing a range of factors in what National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has called an \u201call-hands-on-deck event.\u201d",
      "All aboard the two aircraft were killed, with officials examining the actions of the military pilot as well as air traffic control after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the American Airlines jet.",
      "Air crash investigations normally take 12-18 months, and investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause.",
      "Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter\u2019s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said.",
      "Although some of the airspace had already been restricted following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration decided to indefinitely bar most helicopters from using the low-to-the-ground routes that run under or parallel to the airport\u2019s flightpaths, an official told the AP on Friday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.",
      "Military aircraft frequently conduct such flights in and around the nation\u2019s capital for familiarization with routes they would fly in case of a major catastrophe or an attack on the U.S. that would require relocation of key officials from the capital region.",

He stressed that it remained the Pentagon\u2019s duty to also mitigate risks, while conducting such training. But he underscored U.S. forces need \u201cto ensure, if unfortunately, there were a real world event where things needed to happen we could respond to it day or night.\u201d",
      "The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",
      "One air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened, according to a report by the FAA that was obtained by the AP. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines the roles at 9:30 p.m., once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier.",
      "\u201cThe position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\u201d the report said.",
      "A person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.",

      "Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.",
      "A top Army aviation official said the crew of the helicopter, a Black Hawk, was \u201cvery experienced\u201d and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city.",

      "The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision.",
      "Koziol said investigators need to analyze the flight data before making conclusions about altitude.",
      "President Donald Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform that the helicopter was \u201cflying too high\u201d at the time of the crash.",

      "The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, along with one person on the ground, bringing the total death toll to 50.",

      "A new report says the expansion of nickel mining in Indonesia is a threat to one of Earth's most biodiverse marine regions",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- One of Earth's most biodiverse marine regions is threatened by the expansion of nickel mining projects in Indonesia, according to a new report.",
      "Satellite analysis and on-the-ground visits found a rapid increase in land given over to mining pits in Raja Ampat Regency, a group of tropical islands near West Papua, according to the report from Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia.",
      "A few degrees south of the equator, the islands are home to 75% of the world\u2019s coral species and over 1,600 fish species, including critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles and vulnerable reef manta rays. The regency has at least nine marine protected areas spread over nearly 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres), and was named a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2023, recognizing the international value of its geological heritage.",
      "Much of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more. Experts fear that continued expansion of mining \u2014 which more than tripled in the area the past five years \u2014 will lead to further deforestation, water pollution and disruption of the area's precious ecosystem.",
      "Auriga Nusantara's report found that land used for mining in Raja Ampat grew by about 494 hectares (about 1,220 acres) from 2020 through 2024. That was about three times the rate of expansion from the previous five years. The total permit area for mining in Raja Ampat \u2014 all for nickel \u2014 is more than 22,420 hectares, or about 55,400 acres.",
      "Felled trees and open pits of orange-brown gravel and earth scar the islands where mining has started, according to Auriga Nusantara. Sediment from the mines could also be seen along the islands\u2019 coasts as it was carried away by the ocean\u2019s current.",
      "\u201cAs long as the nickel mining continues to operate, the sediment will destroy coral and its surrounding ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Timer Manurung, the director of Auriga Nusantara. \u201dIt\u2019s really a threat for Raja Ampat, as the archipelago is known for ocean biodiversity and richness that makes it an international tourism destination.\u201d",
      "With the world\u2019s largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "New mining pits were located on at least four islands in the regency, according to the report. One island where mining has occurred is located within the UNESCO Global Geopark area.",
      "Experts fear the expansion of mining in Raja Ampat could have a disastrous impact on the rich marine ecosystem.",
      "\u201cSedimentation, or the waste runoff generated from the mining on land that flows into the water, devastates downstream marine ecosystems,\u201d said Victor Nikijuluw, a program advisor for Indonesia-based environmental organization Konservasi Indonesia, in recent written responses to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis muddy flow from mining clouds, waters, smothers coral reefs, displaces the animals that can leave the area, and generally endangers the nature that local biodiversity and communities depend on.\u201d",
      "The diverse natural landscape and world-class diving destination has become a growing tourism draw for Indonesia: In 2023 the area drew over 19,800 tourists, more than three times the number that visited in 2022, according to Indonesia\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Local communities who rely on the area for their local livelihoods \u2014 including subsistence fishing for food and tourism-related activities for income \u2014 have said they've noticed decreased water quality since mining began, said marine ecologist Edy Setyawan, who works in Raja Ampat.",
      "\u201cThey've seen the water get murkier and murkier,\u201d he told AP.",
      "The Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association expressed concerns about the expansion of nickel mining in Raja Ampat last year.",
      "Despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia\u2019s constitutional court that small islands require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities \u2014 including mining \u2014 as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas, mining continues to have a devastating impact on communities.",
      "In a December 2024 written response to AP questions on why small islands were still being mined in Indonesia, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said there is a \u201ccritical need for rigorous environmental impact assessments and sustainable development practices\" for small islands.",
      "The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about mining in Raja Ampat.",
      "The UNESCO Global Geopark did not respond to a request for comment from AP.",
      "Despite the court ruling, Indonesia\u2019s government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia.",

    "story": [
      "Civil rights activists have gathered outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters to call for a boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Civil rights activists gathered outside the headquarters of Target Corp. on Thursday to call for a national boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target announced last Friday that it would join competitor Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back their DEI initiatives, which have come under attack from conservatives and the new White House of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, a veteran civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis and founder of the Racial Justice Network, joined other local activists and their supporters at a news conference to urge people to begin the boycott on Saturday, the first day of Black History Month. Many of the participants were regular Target shoppers until now, she said.",
      "Levy Armstrong said they were \u201cstunned\u201d that Target, which increased its commitment to building a more diverse workforce in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in 2020, backed away from its support of racial equity.",
      "\u201cWe thought that they would hold the line. We thought that they would continue to stand for the values that we all hold dear,\u201d she said. \"But instead they acted cowardly, and they made the decision to bow down to the Trump administration. Well, we are here today saying we will not bow down. We will not step back, and we will not turn around.\u201d",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations, said that as a company based in the city where Floyd's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice, Target must be called out.",
      "\u201cWe here in Minneapolis today, the good people of the state, are saying to our friends all over the country, \u2018If you were moved to do something good after the murder of George Floyd, it is time for you to stand up and boycott Target,\u2019\u201d Hussein said.",
      "The organizers of the boycott include local Black Lives Matter groups. During the boycott announcement, some speakers cut up their distinctive red Target charge cards, while others called on DEI supporters to shop at Costco, which reaffirmed its commitment to DEI last week.",
      "Despite the anger with Target, the news conference-turned-rally took on a festive atmosphere, with a New Orleans-style brass band playing protest songs like Bob Marley's \u201cGet Up, Stand Up.\u201d Participants circled up for a prayer before the speeches began.",
      "Target, which long was viewed as a strong advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the call for a boycott. But in a memo to employees last week, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the company's decision to retire its diversity goals as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s human resource and customer engagement strategy.",
      "\u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Levy Armstrong said Target has not reached out to her or other local Black leaders. She said they expected more from Target, and now feel like everything it had done in support of people of color was just window dressing. The starting point for any conversation, she said, would be for the company reverse its decision immediately.",
      "\u201cTarget knows what its presence and its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion means to this community,\" Levy Armstrong said. \u201cSo that is why we are focusing on Target first. But that does not mean that those other businesses should not also be held accountable. All of those businesses should be held accountable, and they should not have access to our dollars.\u201d",
      "Speakers also called on long-established civil rights groups that have benefited from Target\u2019s philanthropy, such as the NAACP and the Urban League, to join the opposition to Target\u2019s decision. Levy Armstrong and Hussein said they plan to partner with other national organizations to get the word out about the boycott and to take other steps they were not yet ready to share publicly.",
      "Ever since calls for a boycott began circulating on social media, the founders of several Black-owned businesses that sell their products in Target stores or through the company's online platforms have expressed concern that a broad boycott might hurt them. They included the owners of hair care brands The Doux and Camille Rose, and the cosmetics brand Lip Bar.",
      "The Minneapolis organizers said Black consumers and their white allies can continue to support those companies while cutting Target out.",
      "\u201cWe are asking people to go on their websites and buy directly from those Black companies, because Target will not see a single one of our Black dollars,\u201d Levy Armstrong said."

    "story": [
      "Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal Doug Burgum as North Dakota governor catered to the whims of oil and gas executives while leveraging those connections to expand his political profile",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- When North Dakota's petroleum association was going to hold a banquet honoring top fracking executives last year, it turned to Gov. Doug Burgum. The two-term Republican, now President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, co-hosted the event \u2014 at the governor's mansion.",
      "And when energy industry lobbyists were looking for help taking on Biden administration greenhouse gas rules, they also turned to Burgum. In an email to Burgum's office seeking the legal heft the state could provide, an industry lobbyist argued that \u201ccombating\u201d such regulations required \u201ca one-two punch\" from industry and government.",
      "While it is not surprising that the governor of the third-largest oil producing state would have a close relationship with fossil fuel producers, records obtained by the Associated Press reveal Burgum's administration eagerly assisted the industry even as the governor was profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies. And his assistance came at a time when Burgum was leaning on those very connections to build his national profile in the Republican Party.",
      "Now that he's been confirmed to run the Interior Department, Burgum will have vast control over federal lands, including the issuance of oil and gas leases, as well as a mandate from Trump to extract such resources even though the U.S. is producing record amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "Those ties concern Democrats and environmentalists who say his zeal to expand drilling was \u201ctroubling.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre you going to protect our resources, or are you going to \u2018drill, baby, drill?\u2019\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, asked during Burgum's confirmation hearing this month.",
      "The selection of Burgum, who briefly pursued the presidency in 2023 before endorsing Trump, represents an abrupt pivot from Biden's emphasis on combating climate change. It also signals that Trump intends to follow through on a proposal made last spring when he urged oil and gas CEOs to donate $1 billion to his campaign in exchange for the dismantling of Biden's environmental agenda.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for Burgum declined to make him available for an interview.",
      "\u201cGovernor Burgum worked tirelessly to build a prosperous economy in North Dakota,\" spokesman Rob Lockwood said in a statement. \"This economic growth included sustainably developing natural resources. As governor, he met with job creators and leaders who generated opportunities for the people of North Dakota.\u201d",
      "Under the partisan glare of Washington, and faced with stricter federal ethics rules governing conflicts of interest, Burgum has pledged to sell his interest in his family\u2019s lease with the shale oil giant Continental Resources, as well as another one with Hess, a Chevron subsidiary. He has also pledged to sell stock held in a handful of energy companies, some of which he interacted with as governor, which are worth as much as $200,000 according to his 2023 financial disclosures.",
      "There is perhaps no better demonstration of Burgum\u2019s close ties to oil and gas producers than his friendship with Harold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources who is responsible for much of North Dakota\u2019s fracking boom. The billionaire Oklahoma wildcatter advises Trump on energy policy and is widely viewed as playing a role in helping Burgum secure the nomination to lead Interior.",
      "Hamm did not respond to a request for comment made through his company.",
      "During his 2023 state-of-the-state speech, Burgum likened Hamm to Teddy Roosevelt for his \"grit, resilience, hard work and determination\" that he said \u201cchanged North Dakota and our nation.\u201d The shout-out came after Hamm had donated $50 million toward a library honoring Roosevelt in western North Dakota \u2014 a passion project of Burgum's.",
      "The documents obtained by AP reveal that several months later Hamm gifted Burgum a set of cuff links along with a note thanking Burgum for his \u201cfriendship\" and willingness to take a break from the \u201cgrueling task\u201d of running for president to speak at an energy conference that Hamm had hosted in Oklahoma City.",
      "These were not his only displays of patronage. Though Burgum, an independently wealthy former software company CEO, had a dim chance of winning the Republican presidential primary, Hamm's Continental Resources contributed $250,000 in the summer of 2023 to a super PAC supporting Burgum, campaign finance disclosures show. He also contributed to Burgum's campaign for governor.",
      "Emails between Burgum and Hamm's offices reveal the two communicated often.",
      "In a May 2020 email, Hamm's executive assistant asked if Burgum had time to talk with Hamm and shared a briefing document that railed against wind power, blasting wind turbines as a blight on \u201cour special places and sacred lands\u201d while excoriating tax breaks for wind energy providers as \"unconscionable.\"",
      "\u201cThis does NOTHING to Make America Great Again!\u201d the document states.",
      "Though Burgum set a goal in 2021 to make North Dakota carbon-neutral by 2030, he has adopted Hamm's tone. During his Senate confirmation hearing this month, he was dismissive of renewable energy, such as wind power, suggesting such sources were unreliable when compared to fossil fuels.",
      "In early 2023, as Hamm prepared to publish a memoir, Continental lobbyist Blu Hulsey emailed to ask if Burgum could write a blurb praising the book, the newly obtained records show. Burgum happily complied, heaping praise on the memoir, which the governor called \u201can inspiring story worthy of sharing.\u201d Burgum added that Hamm's impact was \"immeasurable.\u201d",
      "Ethics experts say there are other aspects of their relationship that pose a greater conflict of interest. As governor, Burgum never disclosed that his family leased roughly 200 acres of farmland to Continental for well drilling, as previously reported by CNBC. When Burgum ran for president and faced greater transparency requirements, he revealed making as much as $50,000 in royalties from Continental in 2023.",
      "Despite this relationship, Burgum routinely took action that benefited Hamm's company. As chairman of North Dakota's Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, he voted nearly a dozen times or more on measures that had favorable outcomes for Continental, records show.",
      "\u201cNorth Dakota is a leading energy producing state,\" Lockwood, the Burgum spokesman said. \"Tens of thousands of families and mineral owners have similar arrangements. As the publicly available disclosures show: the cited agreement began many years before he became governor.\u201d",
      "Burgum also used the governor's office to support a proposed pipeline that received $250 million in financial backing from Hamm. If completed, it will transport earth-warming CO2 gas that is the byproduct of ethanol fuel production to North Dakota, where it will be stored deep underground. It\u2019s been touted as a way to decarbonize the atmosphere, but has also run into stiff resistance from landowners, who fear their property will be seized to complete the project.",
      "Sarah Vogel, a Democrat and former North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner who previously sat on the commission, said Burgum seemed more like a cheerleader of the industry than a regulator.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he had a regulator\u2019s mindset. He had a promoter\u2019s mindset, which has probably made him beloved in the oil and gas industry,\u201d Vogel said.",
      "Hamm is not the only oil executive or lobbyist who has cultivated ties with Burgum, emails and office schedules show. Ryan Berger, a lobbyist for Occidental Petroleum, emailed Burgum's staff last year seeking a meeting for Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub after Burgum moderated a panel she participated in at an oil industry conference.",
      "\u201cIn an ideal world, a face-to-face over lunch or dinner would be amazing,\u201d Berger wrote in a May 2024 email. He added that Hollub had recently discussed energy issues \u201cdirectly with President Trump\u201d and \u201cwe thought you would benefit from hearing from her\u201d to see \u201cif there are mutually shared policies and perspectives that could be amplified this year.\u201d",
      "Berger declined to comment on the email. Lockwood, the spokesman, declined to say if Burgum had a meeting with Hollub happened.",
      "The records revealed that a Who's Who of oil executives had calls scheduled with Burgum. The include: CEOs of Chevron and Exxon; Marathon Oil officials had an audience with Burgum in 2022; and the governor also spoke before the Hess Corporation's board of directors' dinner. Burgum's family also has an oil lease with Hess that paid him as much as $1,000 in 2023, according to his financial disclosure.",
      "Burgum turned down an invitation to address an American Petroleum Institute convention in Washington, the records show, but agreed to speak at a private dinner for the American Exploration and Production Council in 2023, which drew top executives from Conoco Phillips, Devon Energy, Hilcorp and others.",
      "When Burgum was a leading contender last year to be Trump's vice presidential pick, he co-hosted a banquet at the governor's mansion with the North Dakota Petroleum Council that drew fracking industry heavy hitters, lobbyists and executives. Burgum, Hamm and Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy who is now Trump's pick for energy secretary, addressed attendees as they dined on beef, walleye cakes and bourbon caramel-topped cobbler.",
      "On Inauguration Day, after he had been named by Trump to lead Interior, Burgum declined an invitation to a party at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel that was hosted by Hamm and a number of petroleum trade associations and oil companies.",
      "Burgum\u2019s presence may not have been missed. Many of those executives and lobbyists, who will have business before the Interior Department, have shown they know how to reach him.",

      "Officials say Dubai International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest for international travel, saw a record 92.3 million passengers pass through its terminals in 2024",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, saw a record 92.3 million passengers pass through its terminals in 2024, officials announced Thursday.",
      "The result cements Dubai's bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic, surpassing the previous record set in 2018 for the first time. Today, the airport feels like it is bursting at the seams with aircraft movements and crowds moving through its cavernous terminals as authorities plan to move operations in 10 years to the city-state's second airport after a nearly $35 billion upgrade.",
      "Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced the figure on the social media platform X. The state-owned airport is home to the long-haul carrier Emirates, which powers the network of state-owned and state-linked businesses known as \"Dubai Inc.\"",
      "\u201cDubai is the airport of the world ... and a new world in the aviation sector,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed wrote.",
      "In 2023, the airport, known as DXB, had 86.9 million passengers. Its 2019 traffic was 86.3 million passengers. It had 89.1 million passengers in 2018 \u2014 its previous busiest-ever year before the pandemic, while 66 million passengers passed through in 2022.",
      "A real-estate boom and the city's highest-ever tourism numbers have made Dubai a destination as well as a layover. However, the city is now grappling with increasing traffic and costs pressuring both its Emirati citizens and the foreign residents who power its economy.",
      "In 10 years, Dubai plans to move its airport operations to Al Maktoum International Airport, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) away from DXB. The airport, which opened in 2010 with one terminal and is known as DWC, served as a parking lot for Emirates\u2019 double-decker Airbus A380s and other aircraft during the pandemic. But since then, it has slowly returned to life with cargo and private flights. It also hosts the biennial Dubai Air Show and has a vast, empty desert in which to expand.",
      "DXB and DWC serve 106 airlines flying to 272 cities in 107 countries across the world."

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:26:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
    "story": [
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
      "ATLANTA -- The pitch from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is simple: Putting limits on lawsuits will halt rising insurance costs.",
      "The reality, though, is more complicated.",
      "Changes could reduce liability insurance costs for businesses and commercial property owners. The evidence is mixed on whether it would drive large premium reductions for car and other types of insurance. And some researchers say efforts limiting lawsuits, often called tort reform, fattens insurers' profits more than it cuts the price of policies.",
      "\u201cThe net impact is that it really improves insurer profitability,\u201d said Tyler Leverty, a business professor who studies risk and insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "When Kemp unveils his proposals Thursday, the Republican governor is likely to keep leaning on his argument that everyone's insurance rates are increasing because unfair lawsuits are on the rise and juries are awarding excessive damages.",
      "The issue is Kemp\u2019s top priority this year after promising the Georgia Chamber of Commerce he would take action and instead pushed a law to have Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King gather data in 2024.",
      "King said that lawsuits are driving insurance companies to reduce coverage for retail businesses, apartment owners, drivers and others. He said business owners in areas that insurers label as high crime are among those struggling the most. Companies that offer low-income housing have also complained.",
      "\u201cGo down to southeast Atlanta and talk to the small convenience owners having to close because they can\u2019t find insurance,\u201d King said.",
      "Some say there's no evidence that a nationwide litigation crisis is driving high insurance rates.",
      "\u201cI went in search of the data, and I have not found it,\u201d said Kenneth Klein, a law professor at California Western School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s to say we cannot document it.\u201d",
      "But Mike Iverson of Oakbridge Insurance and former president of the Independent Insurance Agents Association said insurance companies like predictability when determining rates and how to spread out losses.",
      "In a well-known case, a jury awarded a man almost $43 million after a shooting in a CVS parking lot in Atlanta, arguing the company should have strengthened security. In another case, a Jonesboro mobile home park was ordered to pay $31 million to the daughter of a man who was shot and killed there.",
      "Opponents note that few verdicts are that large and insurance companies are still profitable. They want lawmakers to demand more transparency on how they set rates.",
      "\u201cWhenever they want an excuse to raise rates or limit coverage they will always point to a verdict here and there and make all kinds of claims about how it\u2019s affecting their bottom line,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School.",
      "Studying how tort reform impacts premiums in other states is difficult because other factors are in play and there are different combinations of reform. Some saw benefits, but the research varies.",
      "Other factors that influence insurance rates include inflation, extreme weather, and the costs of labor and materials. It is normal for insurance markets to cycle through tough years where less coverage is offered as rates rise.",
      "In many lines of coverage, including those not heavily impacted by lawsuits, insurers in 2022 were less profitable in Georgia than in several other states, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A spokesperson said over a longer period, though, nothing is abnormal about Georgia's fluctuations.",
      "King\u2019s report, using mostly auto insurance data, says the number of claims and the size of resulting payments have risen over the years, especially those involving lawsuits. Some numbers dropped in 2022 and 2023, but he said that was because the data is incomplete.",
      "King also found that a greater percentage of legal claims are resulting in payments that hit the maximum dollar amount a policy covers.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, which lobbies against tort reform, disputes King's conclusions.",
      "Risk consultant David Stegall said the number of claims is in line with Georgia\u2019s high number of car accidents. Both claims and payouts have mostly been stable or falling, especially when adjusted for population growth and inflation, he said.",
      "He also found that while Georgia residents pay between 11% and 68% more for car insurance than residents of other states, they are more than 200% more likely to be in an accident.",
      "Adam Willis, president of trucking firm F&W Transportation, said his company\u2019s premiums have doubled over the last 10 years while fewer insurers offer full coverage. His company also has been sued more often, he said.",
      "Defenders of the current system say the trade-offs of lawsuit limits are a bad deal.",
      "\u201cThe governor says that limiting your right as a consumer will lower your insurance costs, but that is not only a bad idea for everyday citizens, it\u2019s just not correct,\u201d said state Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat.",

      "AUBURN, N.Y. -- A New York food bank was offered a huge donation of fresh fish this month \u2014 but it came with a catch.",
      "LocalCoho, a soon-to-close salmon farm in the small upstate city of Auburn, wanted to give 40,000 pounds (18,100 kilograms) of coho salmon to the Food Bank of Central New York, a mother lode of high-quality protein that could feed thousands of families.",
      "But the fish were still alive and swimming in the farm\u2019s giant indoor tanks. The organizations would need to figure out how to get some 13,000 salmon from the water and then have them processed into frozen fillets for distribution to regional food pantries.",
      "And they\u2019d need to do it fast, before the business closed for good. LocalCoho is ceasing operations this Friday.",
      "Thanks to dozens of food pantry volunteers willing to help staffers scoop up the salmon, the team was able to empty the tanks in a matter of weeks and cold pack tons of fish for shipment to a processor.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we only had weeks to execute this really ratcheted up the intensity and the anxiety a little bit,\u201d said Brian McManus, the food bank\u2019s chief operations officer. \u201cI knew that we had the will. I knew we had the expertise.\u201d",
      "Tackling food waste has been a daunting challenge for years both in the U.S. and around the world. More than one-third of the food produced in the U.S. is never eaten and much of it ends up in landfills.",
      "On a recent day, workers waded through knee-deep water teeming with salmon to fill their nets. Christina Hudson Kohler was among the volunteers who donned waterproof overalls and gloves to grab the fish-laden nets and empty their contents into cold storage containers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kohler said during a break. \u201cIn the past, my volunteer work with the food bank has been sorting carrots or peppers, or gleaning out in the field.\u201d",
      "LocalCoho is a startup that had been piloting a sustainable salmon farming system employing recirculated water. Its facility west of Syracuse had been supplying coho salmon to wholesalers and retailers, including high-end Manhattan sushi restaurants, with the goal of building regional farms across the country.",
      "But company officials said they could not raise enough capital to expand and become profitable. Thus, they decided to wrap things up at the end of January.",
      "With a shutdown looming, farm manager Adam Kramarsyck said they didn\u2019t want the fish to go to waste or end up as biofuel. That's when they reached out to see if the fish could be donated as food.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018lemonade out of lemons,\u2019 I guess is the phrase,\u201d Kramarsyck said.",
      "LocalCoho can process about 600 fish a week by hand. But there was less than a month to clear the tanks of many times that number of fish.",
      "Enter the food bank.",
      "McManus was excited by the offer to land so many fish \u2014 and nervous about the challenge. But while the Syracuse-based operation knew how to distribute canned or frozen seafood, they\u2019re not set up to handle fresh fish. How could they turn thousands of fish into frozen fillets in a tight time frame?",
      "Kramarsyck said it took \u201ctons and tons of logistics.\u201d",
      "The food bank enlisted 42 volunteers to help out. A local business with refrigerated trucks, Brown Carbonic, offered to ship the fish for free to a processor an hour away in Rochester. And LocalCoho staff pitched in to get the job done in time.",
      "\u201cA lot of companies going out of business would just be like, \u2018Take what you can get, we\u2019ll do the best we can.\u2019 I mean, they\u2019re working extra hard,\u201d said Andrew Katzer, the food bank\u2019s director of procurement.",
      "The salmon was being processed and quick-frozen. It will be distributed soon among 243 food pantries, as well as soup kitchens, shelters and other institutions in the food bank\u2019s network.",
      "All told, the catch is expected to yield more than 26,000 servings of hard-to-source protein for the hungry.",
      "\u201cProtein, animal protein is very, very desirable. We know that people need it for nourishment and it\u2019s difficult to get. And so this is going to make a very large impact,\" said McManus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate this being here very long,'' he added. \"We\u2019ve had salmon before, but not like this.\u201d"

      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

      "The Fed\u2019s decision could hint at rates staying on hold for a while following their swift drop at the end of 2024. Lower rates would help the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households  and companies to borrow, but the downside is they could also fuel more inflation.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.53%, where it was late Tuesday.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank could cut rates if inflation slows further or if the job market suddenly weakens. But \u201cright now, we don\u2019t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don\u2019t need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments.\u201d",
      "While Wall Street would almost always prefer lower interest rates, \u201cwe would continue to focus on why the Fed won\u2019t cut anytime soon, specifically a strong economy and labor, which bodes well for solid corporate earnings growth,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.",

      "That casts doubt about whether AI development broadly will require as much spending on chips, vast data centers  and electricity as Wall Street and Big Tech had assumed.",
      "Nvidia,, whose stock has almost become a symbol of the AI bonanza, fell 4% Wednesday after plunging nearly 17% Monday and then jumping nearly 9% Tuesday. It was the single heaviest weight dragging the S&P 500 lower, by far.",
      "Big gains for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies were instrumental in the S&P 500\u2019s rallying to back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% for the first time since before the millennium. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500's total return last year.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, Starbucks  rose 8.1% after delivering a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. T-Mobile US rallied 6.3% after topping Wall Street\u2019s expectations for both profit and revenue in the last three months of 2024. It also said it expects to add between a net 5.5 million and 6 million in postpaid customers this year.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group rose after announcing it would be getting into the financial services business via a partnership with Charles Schwab. TMTG said more details would be released later this year, and what had been a double-digit gain for the notoriously volatile stock shrank to an increase of 6.8%.",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company\u2019s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses.",
      "The iPhone\u2019s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year\u2019s October-December period wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device\u2019s AI features didn\u2019t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn\u2019t available in many markets outside the U.S.",
      "The countries still awaiting Apple\u2019s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground.",
      "Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion.",
      "Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple\u2019s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year.",
      "Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone\u2019s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple\u2019s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp.",
      "The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple\u2019s other products may not boost the company\u2019s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June.",
      "The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple\u2019s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible.",
      "Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn\u2019t been investing as heavily in AI \u2013 one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek\u2019s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum.",
      "Apple\u2019s services division remained the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google\u2019s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly."

      "U.S. government regulators sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks on Thursday, saying the combination would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation",
      "The Justice Department sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks on Thursday, the first attempt to stop a merger by a new Trump administration that is expected to take a softer approach to mergers.",
      "The Justice complaint alleges that Hewlett Packer Enterprise, under increased competitive pressure from the fast-rising Juniper, was forced to discount products and services and invest more in its own innovation, eventually leading the company to simply buy its rival.",
      "The lawsuit said that the combination of businesses would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation.",
      "HPE and Juniper issued a joint statement Thursday, saying the companies strongly oppose the DOJ's decision.",
      "\u201cWe will vigorously defend against the Department of Justice\u2019s overreaching interpretation of antitrust laws and will demonstrate how this transaction will provide customers with greater innovation and choice, positively change the dynamics in the networking market,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company would create more competition, not less, the companies said.",
      "The Justice Department's intervention \u2014 the first of the new administration and just 10 days after Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 comes as somewhat of a surprise. Most predicted a second Trump administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under former President Joe Biden\u2019s watch.",
      "Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced one year ago that it was buying Juniper Networks for $40 a share in a deal expected to double HPE\u2019s networking business.",
      "In its complaint, the government painted a picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a company desperate to keep up with a smaller rival that was taking its business.",
      "HPE salespeople were concerned about the \u201cJuniper threat,\u201d the complaint said, also alleging that one former executive told his team that \u201cthere are no rules in a street fight,\u201d encouraging them to \u201ckill\u201d Juniper when competing for sales opportunities.",
      "The Justice Department said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper are the U.S.'s second- and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses.",
      "\u201cThe proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market \u2014 and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,\u201d the complaint said, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.",
      "Many businesses and investors accused Biden regulatory agencies of antitrust overreach and were looking forward to a friendlier Trump administration.",
      "Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a $24.6 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would have been the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Two judges agreed with the FTC\u2019s case, blocking the proposed deal in December.",
      "In 2023, the Department of Justice, through the courts, forced American and JetBlue airlines to abandon their partnership in the northeast U.S., saying it would reduce competition and eventually cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021.",
      "U.S. regulators also proposed last year to break up Google for maintaining an \u201cabusive monopoly\u201d through its market-dominate search engine, Chrome. Court hearings on Google\u2019s punishment are scheduled to begin in April, with the judge aiming to issue a final decision before Labor Day. It\u2019s unclear where the Trump administration stands on the case.",
      "One merger that both Trump and Biden agreed shouldn\u2019t go through is Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the nearly $15 billion acquisition just before his term ended. The companies challenged that decision in a federal lawsuit early this year.",
      "Trump has consistently voiced opposition to the deal, questioning why U.S. Steel would sell itself to a foreign company given the regime of new tariffs he has vowed."

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",

      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "But that likelihood is low, with just a 1.3% chance that the asteroid could make direct impact on the planet on Dec. 22, 2032, according to space experts.",
      "Astronomers monitoring the ATLAS telescope at the University of Hawaii first spotted the asteroid as it was moving away from Earth on Dec. 27 and reported it to the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center, which determined it had never before been seen, Kelly Fast, a planetary defense officer at NASA, told ABC News.",
      "Asteroid 2024 YR4 has an \"interesting\" orbit, Fast said. The elongated path takes the asteroid around the sun and into Earth's vicinity before it ventures far out between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, she said.",
      "\"In the past, even though it's passed through the inner solar system before, it didn't always pass by where the Earth happened to be, where it could be picked up easily,\" Fast said, explaining why the asteroid was only recently discovered.",
      "Because of its unique orbit, astronomers are trying to learn everything they can about 2024 YR4 before it disappears out of sight after April, Fast said. It's not expected to be visible again until 2028.",
      "The end of 2032 is when astronomers predict 2024 YR will come close to Earth again, Fast said, adding that further observations are expected to provide data to support the likelihood that 2024 YR4 will avoid hitting Earth.",
      "\"The worldwide community is continuing to take observations,\" Fast said. \"it can't all happen in a day, because the asteroid has to keep moving in the sky.\"",
      "Astronomers estimate the size of asteroids based on how much light they reflect. Based on current data, 2024 YR is large enough for it to potentially cause localized damage were it to strike a populated city, Fast said.",
      "In 1908, the Tunguska asteroid, which was a similar size, flattened trees over an area of about 1,250 miles after it exploded in the skies over Siberia.",
      "Congress has tasked NASA with locating asteroids larger than 450 feet in length \u2013 large enough to potentially do \"regional\" damage were it to strike the planet, Fast said.",
      "Smaller asteroids, within a few yards in diameter, tend to be disintegrated by Earth's atmosphere and transformed into fireballs, Fast said.",
      "NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Asteroid Watch tracks asteroids and comets that will make relatively close approaches to Earth. Five asteroids are forecast to pass near Earth in the coming days.",
      "On Friday, two asteroids are expected to pass near Earth, according to the updated list. Asteroid 2025 BR2, with JPL describes as an \"airplane-size\" space rock about 67 feet long, is expected to pass within 3.21 million miles of Earth, while another asteroid, 2015 DJ155 \u2013 two-and-a-half times as large, at 170 feet \u2013 is expected to pass within 4.42 million miles of Earth.",
      "Two more asteroids, 2025 BG4 and 2025 BR7 \u2013 75 and 100 feet in length, respectively \u2013 are forecast to pass within 3.09 million miles and 3.58 million miles of Earth, respectively, also on Friday.",
      "On Sunday, 2025 BU, which JPL describe as being about the size of a house, at around 54 feet in length, is predicted to pass within 2.1 million miles of Earth, according to Asteroid Watch.",
      "Fast emphasized that although these asteroids are passing \"relatively\" close to Earth, they're still a great distance away. The moon itself is fewer than 240,000 miles from Earth and there are often asteroids passing Earth within that distance, she said.",
      "\"Space is big, and so that's very far away,\" Fast said."

    "summary": "Senior White House officials had not reviewed the Office of Management and Budget's sweeping order freezing federal grants and loans before it was issued, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The funding freeze order was rescinded following legal challenges.",
      "When the Office of Management and Budget issued a sweeping order this week freezing trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, senior White House officials had not reviewed it beforehand, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The order was rescinded following legal challenges and intense backlash amid widespread confusion and disruptions to critical services like Medicaid.",
      "And now, amid the fallout, finger pointing has begun inside the administration, sources said, with the attention turning to Mark Paoletta, OMB's general counsel, who played a key role in drafting the order.",
      "Top White House policy adviser Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf were among those who had been left out of the review process, sources said.",
      "The fallout has already led to discussions about reassigning Paoletta away from his position as OMB's general counsel, though no final decision has been made, according to multiple sources.",
      "Sources said senior advisers were caught off guard and frustrated that they had not reviewed the memo before its release, seeing its rollout as a stain on what had otherwise been smooth messaging around President Donald Trump's rapid rollout of executive orders.",
      "Meanwhile, some rank-and-file officials at OMB were themselves left confused both when the memo was issued and after it was rescinded, sources said.",
      "OMB officials did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge signaled he would issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants. That's now raised concerns that the White House will try to enact the same policy described in the now-rescinded memo.",

      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" Leavitt posted on X, defending the policy after the memo was rescinded. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Despite the Office of Management rescinding their directive, Judge McConnell said he believed there was \"sufficient evidence\" that the government still plans to carry out the policy based on Leavitt's social media post.",

Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation in doubt, the nominee for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services declared in a written statement to senators on Friday that, if confirmed, he will divest his financial stake in an ongoing civil lawsuit against a vaccine manufacturer.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s commitment to walk away from the potential windfall is a major reversal for the nominee, who in his ethics plan submitted to federal officials earlier this month told lawmakers he was entitled to those proceeds so long as the U.S. government wasn\u2019t involved.",
      "Democrats had seized on Kennedy\u2019s financial stake in the lawsuit, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warning that he could use his perch in government to make it easier for lawyers \u2013 including himself \u2013 to sue vaccine manufacturers and drug makers in court.",
      "The lawsuit alleges marketing fraud against pharmaceutical company Merck for its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, which Merck denies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that the vaccine has been proven safe, with more than 160 studies finding no concerns.",

      "The next day, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with Kennedy\u2019s nomination, noting at one point that Kennedy was \u201cfinancially vested in finding fault with vaccines.\u201d",
      "Kennedy told senators in his testimony Thursday that he was giving away his rights to the fees in the lawsuit against Merck. However, it was unclear whether he misspoke because his ethics agreement still maintained that he was entitled to the fees.",

But the diversity language referenced in the article was on the FAA website during the entirety of Trump\u2019s first term and has been on the site for more than a decade, according to Snopes.",

      "ABC NEWS: The director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School, Karen Greenberg. Karen, thanks for being with us. We are talking about an American military base on foreign soil. What does that mean for immigrants' access to due process?",
      "KAREN GREENBERG: OK, so first, it's not really foreign soil in the United States' terms -- it's an outpost of the United States. And that's always been one of the confusing things about Guantanamo.",
      "What it is is a place where, repeatedly, the United States has sought to place individuals without the kinds of protections by law that they have in the United States on the homeland, as we've seen with the detention of war on terror detainees. And also, you know, we can talk about the migration center as well, but it is not correct to call it on foreign soil. It is on a U.S. base located in Guantanamo Bay.",
      "ABC NEWS: All right, so you've been to that facility where they'd be held at Guantanamo Bay. What challenges will the administration face in trying to implement the plan?",
      "GREENBERG: So one big challenge that they're going to face is basically the numbers he was throwing around. He threw out 30,000 -- I don't know that they have the capacity for that, but I have never heard that before. At the height that I knew about it, in the old days and the '90s, I think they held 21,000 at the most.",
      "They've held refugees repeatedly. In current context, President Biden talked about using it for migrants as well, but never, and we're using it now for some intercepted asylum seekers and migrants. But that kind of capacity, that kind of number, hasn't been thrown around before.",
      "So I'm assuming that will mean they will need to build up some kind of facility, not just for the numbers they're talking about in terms of migrants, but also for the guards, the health facilities, etc., etc., that we'll need there.",
      "And just to make a point there, they had to build Guantanamo detention facility, also, you know, for the war on terror detainees. And they did that very rapidly. They did it within 100 days, and built, you know, state-of-the-art maximum security prisons and housing for those who would need to attend to them. So it can be done quickly.",
      "ABC NEWS: As you point out, the base has been used to hold much smaller numbers of immigrants for years. What could some of their experiences tell us about Guantanamo?",
      "GREENBERG: Well, the reports are not good. And I want to say that it's not just the past reports that are not good. It's also, there was a report released in September by the International Refugee Assistance Project, which sort of detailed the conditions that migrants are held in currently at Guantanamo, which included unsanitary conditions, mistreatment, not to mention this sort of fuzzy legal status.",
      "So I don't think that's projected well in the past, there's also been in these prior times, in the '70s and the '90s also, you know, allegations of, and documents of mistreatment and unsanitary conditions, etc.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As the Democratic National Committee prepares to elect a new chair, its departing leader says Democrats should have stuck with Joe Biden in the 2024 race.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Jaime Harrison reflected on why his party lost to President Donald Trump and what might have happened had former Vice President Kamala Harris had more time to campaign after Biden ended his reelection bid following a disastrous debate performance.",
      "He also offered advice to his eventual successor, who will be chosen Saturday. The next DNC chair, Harrison said, needs to insist that the party not be a \u201crubber stamp\u201d to its presidential candidate.",

      "HARRISON: \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s one answer. A lot of people like to come up with things, and they say it\u2019s the economy. Well, it could have been a part of it. I think every state had their own little nuance. In Michigan, the Palestinian issue played something there.\"",
      "\"The gap in which she lost wasn\u2019t huge, but when you add up little pockets where it\u2019s, some people because of Gaza, some people because of the economy, some people because she was a woman. And I think in many of those states, those little nicks here and there added up to how she lost in some of those states.\u201d",
      "HARRISON: \u201cHad she had more runway, it would have been probably easier for her and for the campaign. We were building a race for Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "\u201cJoe Biden gave the State of the Union, people said it was one of the best State of the Unions that we\u2019ve ever seen. Then we move forward to the debate, and people were like, that was a horrible debate performance. And then my thought was: \u2018Joe Biden secured the nomination. The primary was done, and so, I\u2019m a loyal guy. We\u2019re riding with Biden.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd if you look at the other side, in terms of Republicans, Donald Trump had just been convicted, how many times for all these felonies? And you didn\u2019t hear a peep from the Republicans, in terms of like, \u2018We need to jettison Donald Trump, and we need to open up a new primary, and we need to do this and that.\u2019 And so sometimes, I think, Democrats can learn something in terms of, let\u2019s put a line of defense around our folks and defend them as well.\u201d",
      "HARRISON: \u201cThat\u2019s my normal default, is that you stick by your people, right, particularly people who have worked hard on behalf of the party.\"",
      "\u201cI went into this thinking, OK, you've got probably the most successful of my lifetime legislative president who has poured tons of money into making sure that not just Joe Biden and Kamala Harris get elected, but Democrats get elected \u2014 not just in the battleground states, but all states who support a lot of resources and his own time fundraising in order to strengthen the state parties.\u201d",
      "\"And then when he hits a roadblock, when he hits a bump in the road, do we stick with him, or do we jettison him? That\u2019s the mentality that I had going into this. And my nature is, 'I'm on the team with you, you\u2019re my quarterback. You got sacked a few times. But you know what? I'm going to block the hell out of the next person that's coming at you.' And that is not always the mentality of everybody in my party. And so sometimes, people look on the sidelines, ready to call in the backup.\u201d",
      "HARRISON: \u201cI had a very small group to whom I basically said, just game out for me what happens ... if I have to do something, because people were asking for a big primary and this and that \u2014 and again, we have a short time frame, and so basically it was going back to the rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even talk to all of the people in my inner circle. There were two staffers ... just in case anything happened, I wanted to make sure that I knew what we could do. And so we had some structure for what something would look like.\u201d",
      "HARRISON: \u201cShe was literally on it. I wanted to get a sense of whether or not we were going to have a lot of people who were going to throw their hats in the ring.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so I started making phone calls just asking, \u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the news about the president,\u2019 and to a person, they\u2019re saying, \u2018I just got off the phone with the vice president, and I\u2019m pledging my support.' I must have been chasing her calls, because literally, I\u2019m calling, and everyone said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m supporting her.\u2019\u201d",

It\u2019s more than just turnout. It\u2019s about persuasion. You have to persuade people why you are the best person for them. You have to talk to them about the issues that are important to them. You have to show them that you really are fighting for them, and that means having those individual conversations, but having targeted conversations specifically geared towards the people that you\u2019re talking to.\u201d",

He didn\u2019t close the door on another campaign. He has long been mentioned as a possible future contender for the seat held for decades by his mentor, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.",

      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2",
      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2, but celebrating the midpoint between the shortest and darkest day of the year and the spring equinox has ancient roots in European agricultural life.",
      "Punxsutawney Phil is far from the only groundhog whose human handlers make annual announcements about whether they've seen their own shadows and are predicting six more weeks of winter or an early spring.",
      "The date not only divides the calendar between the winter solstice and the spring equinox \u2014 it's also a time of year that figures in the Celtic calendar and the Christian holiday of Candlemas.",
      "And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil.",
      "Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal celebrations far and wide.",
      "One thing it's not: serious business.",
      "\u201cWe know this is silly; we know this is fun,\u201d said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. \u201cWe want people to come here with a sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Here are some things to know about the holiday:",
      "Celtic people across Europe marked the four days that are midway between the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the fall equinox. What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem.",
      "Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal\u2019s emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Pennsylvania Germans apparently substituted the groundhog, endemic to the eastern and midwestern United States.",
      "Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose 2003 book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection.",
      "Yoder concluded the festival has roots in \u201cancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Germans settled in the area, and in the late 1880s, they started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs.",
      "Members of Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, organized in 1899, care for Phil and his woodchuck family at a customized space beside Punxsutawney Memorial Library, where there's a window with a view into the creature's burrow.",
      "The Punxsutawney groundhog makes predictions, but he's not always predictable. The designated groundhog emerged before sunrise in 1929 and didn't come out until late afternoon in 1941.",
      "The 1993 Bill Murray movie \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.",
      "Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.",
      "The early festivities in Punxsutawney were followed in 1907 by folks in Quarryville, a farming area in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania's southeastern corner. The roughly 240 members of the Slumbering Groundhog Lodge there report the winter forecast from Octoraro Orphie, or least via his well-preserved remains.",
      "The groundhog is a member of the squirrel family and related to chipmunks and prairie dogs. It's also known as a woodchuck, a whistle pig \u2014 or in the parlance of Pennsylvania Dutch, a language with German roots, a \u201cgrundsau.\u201d",
      "Groundhogs are herbivores that are themselves edible to humans, although they are not widely consumed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years.",
      "Some cooks advise groundhogs are best taken when they are young and after clover is in bloom, since a clover diet is thought to improve the meat's taste.",
      "Starting in the 1930s, groundhog lodges opened in eastern Pennsylvania. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry.",
      "Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. They were traditionally all-male groups and several of the clubs remain active.",
      "They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, according to William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor and author of \u201cSerious Nonsense,\u201d a book about the lodges and other efforts to preserve German heritage.",
      "\u201cI think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,\u201d Donner said.",
      "Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what \u201csix weeks of winter\u201d means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow \u2014 and that it's able to communicate that to a human \u2014 are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor impaired.",
      "By all accounts, Phil predicts more winter far more often than he predicts an early spring.",
      "Groundhogs are mostly solitary creatures who start to emerge in midwinter to find a mate. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best.",
      "Among the skeptics is the National Centers for Environmental Information, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The government agency compares Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures to conclude he's hardly perfect."

      "Democrats are poised to elect a new leader in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party\u2019s future",
      "OXON HILL, Md. -- Democrats, desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future.",
      "More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection.",
      "Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong.",
      "Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough.",
      "\u201cAs we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who\u2019s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman and a top candidate for DNC chair.",
      "The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand.",
      "Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.",
      "The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system.",
      "They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.",
      "Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O\u2019Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders\u2019 last presidential campaign.",
      "Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC.",
      "But he has struggled to gain traction.",
      "Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.",
      "Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections.",
      "Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party.",
      "\u201cAs positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I\u2019m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, \u2018We\u2019re in real trouble because I don\u2019t see a desire to change,\u2019\u201d said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.",

      "It had just hosted the next generation of Olympic hopefuls at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the kind of major sporting event that leaders of the largest city in Kansas had envisioned when they opened a 15,000-seat arena in 2010. For Wichita, which once built many of the nation\u2019s aircraft, the skating showcase was another way of putting the community in America's heartland on a larger stage.",
      "Then came the horror of learning the flight never made it.",
      "\u201cWe were so proud to see these high-level athletes, their families, their friends, fans, coming to our community and sharing their skills and talents so that the whole world could see,\u201d Mayor Lily Wu said. \u201cTo end it with this type of tragedy just truly breaks my heart.\u201d",
      "The midair collision Wednesday night between the plane and an Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., has left Wichita grieving. The worst U.S. air disaster in a generation killed 67 people, including young figure skaters who had attended a national development camp in Wichita following the championships. No one survived.",
      "The city of nearly 400,000 residents has deep connections to America's aviation history and is a regional hub for oil companies, engineers and drillers, riding the industry's boom-and-bust cycles.",
      "It was unclear how many of the victims may have been Wichita residents. Authorities have not released a list of the passengers, who included hunting buddies, an attorney on a business trip and a college student returning from her grandfather's funeral.",
      "Following the collision, city and religious leaders held a prayer vigil that turned out hundreds of people who prayed for victims' families and pledged to provide comfort.",
      "\u201cThis unity cannot just stay in sadness. It has to elicit something greater, something brighter, something that can shine forth,\u201d said Rabbi Shmulik Greenberg of Chabad, a Hasidic synagogue and community center in Wichita.",

During World War II, Boeing made more than 1,700 bombers in Wichita, said Logan Daugherty, curator of the Kansas Aviation Museum.",
      "The industry employs tens of thousands of area residents, who work for major manufactures such as Spirit AeroSystems, as well as a network of more than 350 suppliers, according to an economic development agency called the Greater Wichita Partnership.",
      "The community has had its share of other strivers: The first White Castle restaurant opened here in 1921, beginning one of the first fast-food hamburger chains. Two Wichita State University students opened the first Pizza Hut in 1958. Koch Industries \u2014 the energy, agriculture and manufacturing conglomerate with 121,000-plus employees \u2014 has its leafy headquarters grounds in the north part of the city.",
      "The city recently celebrated the first anniversary of the start of the single daily commercial American Airlines flight from Wichita to Washington.",
      "The manufacturer of the passenger airline that went down, Bombardier, has its U.S. headquarters in Wichita. Jim Howell, who serves on the local county commission, said the plane had been certified in the city.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of connections to this plane. There\u2019s a lot of connections to Bombardier as a company,\u201d said Howell, who spent two decades working in flight testing, including a stint with Bombardier in the early 1990s. \u201cWe have a lot of employees who work for Bombardier who are still involved in testing and maintaining those types of planes here in Wichita.\u201d",
      "Wichita's population more than doubled between 1940 and 1960 and has since grown steadily and more diverse. The public school system \u2014 the largest in the state, educating roughly 11% of all Kansas students \u2014 says it has families from more than 100 nations, speaking more than 110 languages and dialects other than English.",
      "It's also a politically diverse city. Although President Donald Trump has carried Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, three times, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has won it twice.",
      "The city has mourned other aviation tragedies, including in 1970, when a plane carrying players, coaches and fans of Wichita State University's football team crashed in Colorado, killing 31 of the 37 people on board.",
      "Following the tragedy in Washington, the city\u2019s nonprofit Wichita Community Foundation almost immediately set up a fund to collect donations for victims\u2019 families, to cover burial expenses and provide mental health or other services. Shelly Prichard, the foundation\u2019s president and CEO, said on the night of the crash they \u201cstarted having people reach out to us about how they could help.\u201d",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A letter submitted to the U.S. Senate that states it was sent by physicians in support of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services includes the names of doctors who have had their licenses revoked, suspended or faced other discipline, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The letter was meant to lend credibility to Kennedy\u2019s nomination, which has faced strenuous opposition from medical experts due to his two decades of anti-vaccine activism. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who boasts on his official website of an effort he created to vaccinate 36,000 children against hepatitis B, expressed hesitancy about Kennedy's nomination and is seen as a key vote.",
      "The AP found that in addition to the physicians who had faced disciplinary action, many of the nearly 800 signers are not doctors. The letter with the names of those who signed was provided to the AP by Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s office after he entered it into the Congressional Record on Wednesday during the first of Kennedy\u2019s two confirmation hearings.",
      "Among those who signed it were a self-described journalist, a certified public accountant, a firefighter/paramedic, a certified health coach and someone who said they had a bachelor\u2019s degree \u201cwith an emphasis on Jungian Psychology.\u201d The signers include at least 75 nurses, as well as physician's assistants. More than 90 did not include any credentials at all.",
      "Over 20 were chiropractors, representing an industry that has funded Kennedy's work. An AP investigation found that donations from a chiropractic group represented one-sixth of the revenues collected by Kennedy's anti-vaccine nonprofit in 2019.",
      "The letter was organized and submitted by MAHA Action, which is run by Del Bigtree, who worked for Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign and is a longtime anti-vaccine activist. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Kennedy transferred the trademark for the \u201cMAHA\u201d slogan to an limited liability company run by Bigtree. Kennedy reported that he received $100,000 in income from licensing the slogan and said in his financial disclosures that he had transferred the trademark for \u201cno compensation.\u201d",
      "MAHA stands for \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d a play on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again.\"",
      "Emma Post, a MAHA Action spokesperson, said in an email that the letter was \u201cshared and circulated organically in a grassroots manner with explicit instructions that it was for physicians only to sign on to.\u201d She did not address the AP\u2019s questions about what further steps the group took to verify credentials, if any.",
      "Bigtree and Kennedy did not return messages seeking comment. A White House spokesman, Kush Desai, said the administration looks forward to the Senate's swift confirmation of Kennedy.",
      "The letter includes the header \u201c Doctors for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201d and begins with the words, \u201cWe, the undersigned physicians.\" It says lower down that it \u201creflects the collective voice of physicians and medical professionals\u201d committed to addressing chronic disease.",
      "The AP\u2019s review found that at least 10 doctors who signed the letter had run into trouble with state medical boards or their board certification body for a variety of alleged misconduct. Sanctions they faced included having their license revoked or suspended, being put on probation, receiving a reprimand or other action. One received a warning letter from the Federal Trade Commission, which said he was unlawfully advertising products as treatments or prevention for COVID-19, including intravenous nutrient therapy and vitamins.",
      "Among the signers was Paul Thomas, an anti-vaccine doctor who voluntarily surrendered his medical license in 2022 after Oregon's medical board found he had engaged in repeated and gross negligence in the practice of medicine.",
      "Thomas did not admit or deny the finding. NBC News reported that Thomas was part of a team assembled by Kennedy who remotely advised an anti-vaccine activist in Samoa during a measles outbreak there on how to treat children with vitamins. A person who responded on behalf of Thomas, DeeDee Hoover, said the information the AP had was inaccurate but did not reply when asked what specifically was wrong.",
      "Other signers included Dr. Simone Gold, who was reprimanded by California\u2019s medical board after she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her conduct at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Gold was recently pardoned by Trump and told the AP in an email that her reprimand and other disciplinary action were overturned by a judge prior to her pardon.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is an honorable and honest person with vast subject matter knowledge and experience who values the health of the American people, and furthermore because he is willing to challenge corporate interests where they conflict with the best interests of those citizens,\u201d Gold wrote in an email.",
      "Meryl Nass, whose medical license was suspended in Maine over her treatment of COVID-19 patients, also signed. She told the AP she is appealing the decision and expects to be fully vindicated.",
      "At least two of the doctors were disciplined, prior to the pandemic, for improperly giving out vaccine waivers, including one who had his license revoked and another who was put on probation. Another doctor's license was revoked for refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines.",
      "Post said MAHA Action\u2019s letter was just one of several provided to the Senate supporting Kennedy, including one that she provided a link to that she said was signed by \u201c17,000 medical professionals.\u201d That letter stated it was from international medical providers and did not include the names of those who signed.",
      "Opponents of Kennedy's nomination sent their own letter with signatures from what they said were more than 18,000 \u201cvetted and verified\u201d doctors. The group, the Committee to Protect Health Care, said that the letter was initially circulated among verified physicians and that as additional signatures were added, their credentials were checked. The group provided the list of signatories to the AP but with anonymized names that included the first initial of their first name along with the first three letters of their last name, as well as their medical credentials. They said doctors' names were anonymized for their privacy and to protect them from harassment.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks this weekend on his first foreign trip in office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks this weekend on his first foreign trip in office, heading to Central America to press President Donald Trump's top priority \u2014 curbing illegal immigration \u2014 and bring the message that the U.S. wants to reclaim control over the Panama Canal despite intense resistance from regional leaders.",
      "It's an unusual destination for the maiden voyage of America\u2019s top diplomat, whose predecessors have generally favored Europe or Asia for their initial outings. It reflects not only the personal interest that Rubio \u2014 the first Hispanic to hold the nation\u2019s most senior Cabinet post \u2014 has in the region but also the Trump administration\u2019s intent to focus much of its foreign policy energy close to home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no accident that my first trip abroad as secretary of state will keep me in the hemisphere,\u201d Rubio wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Friday.",
      "Limiting immigration and fighting narcotics smuggling are major elements of that effort, but another key priority will be curbing China\u2019s growing influence in the Western Hemisphere, topped by reasserting U.S. control over the Panama Canal. The American-built canal was turned over to the Panamanians in 1999 and they object strongly to Trump's demand to hand it back.",
      "Mass migration, drugs and hostile policies pursued by Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have wreaked havoc, Rubio said in the Journal opinion piece. \"All the while, the Chinese Communist Party uses diplomatic and economic leverage \u2014 such as at the Panama Canal \u2014 to oppose the U.S. and turn sovereign nations into vassal states.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Rubio's first stop on the five-nation tour Saturday will be Panama, whose president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, says there will be no negotiation with the United States over ownership of the canal. He said he hoped Rubio\u2019s visit would instead focus on shared interests like migration and combating drug trafficking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I can\u2019t negotiate,\u201d Mulino said Thursday. \"The canal belongs to Panama.\u201d",
      "Yet Rubio said he will make clear Trump's intent. In an interview Thursday with SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly, he said Trump's desire to retake control of the Panama Canal is driven by legitimate national security interests stemming from growing concerns about Chinese activity and influence in Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to address that topic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again. Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. That message has been brought very clear.\u201d",
      "Chinese investments in ports and other infrastructure and facilities at both the Pacific and Caribbean ends of the canal are a cause for major concern, leaving Panama and the critical shipping route vulnerable to China, he said.",
      "Rubio added that \u201cif China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could,\u201d and that would be a violation of the 1977 treaty signed by former President Jimmy Carter under which the U.S. later ceded control.",
      "Despite Mulino's rejection of any negotiation over ownership, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company that was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already under way and could lead to a rebidding process.",
      "What is unclear is whether Trump would accept the transfer of the concession to an American or European firm as meeting his demands, which appear to cover more than just operations.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, Trump is pushing on an open door,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cBut it will depend on how his red lines are defined.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's been a lot of heavy rhetoric and it will be up Rubio to clarify it,\u201d Berg said, adding that some kind of compromise was possible \u201cbut we\u2019ll have to see if he\u2019s really serious about taking it back. If that\u2019s the case then nothing short of that will satisfy him.\u201d",
      "Rubio will arrive in Panama on Saturday for meetings the following day with Mulino and the canal administrator. He will then travel to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "His arrival will come just a day after the U.S. resumed visa processing at its embassy in Bogota, Colombia, which had been shut down Sunday after the Colombian government refused to accept two planeloads of Colombian deportees from the United States.",
      "Previous secretaries of state have often traveled abroad with so-called \u201cdeliverables\u201d \u2014 assistance packages, new cooperation initiatives and the like \u2014 that they can announce at each stop. However, such as with Colombia, Rubio may only be able to bring limited relief from a U.S. freeze on foreign assistance that Trump ordered pending a review of all programs.",
      "In Latin America, such programs have generally focused on policing, counternarcotics operations and efforts to stem illegal migration. Rubio has made provisions for certain programs offering life-saving assistance to be exempted from the funding pause, and waiver applications for programs in several of the countries he will be visiting are under review.",
      "Among the countries for which waivers for certain programs have been submitted are Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and its neighbor, Haiti. Although Rubio will not be traveling to Haiti, the State Department has already allowed some $41 million in support of an international peacekeeping force there to go ahead."

      "PHILADELPHIA -- In Boston, Northeastern University renamed a program for underrepresented students, emphasizing \u201cbelonging\u201d for all. In New Jersey, a session at Rutgers University catering to students from historically Black colleges had to be abruptly canceled. And around the U.S., colleges are assessing program names and titles that could run afoul of a Trump administration crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "New White House orders ban DEI policies in programs that receive federal money. Across higher education, institutions rely on federal funding for research grants, projects and contract work.",
      "As they figure out how to adapt, some schools are staying quiet out of uncertainty, or fear. President Donald Trump has called for compliance investigations at some schools with endowments over $1 billion.",
      "Others have vowed to stand firm.",
      "The president of Mount Holyoke College, a liberal arts school in Massachusetts, said she hopes colleagues in higher education will not capitulate to Trump\u2019s vision for the country. Danielle Holley said she believes Trump\u2019s orders are vulnerable to legal challenges.",
      "\u201cAnything that is done to simply disguise what we\u2019re doing is not helpful,\u201d said Holley, who is Black. \u201cIt validates this notion that our values are wrong. And I don\u2019t believe that the value of saying we live in a multiracial democracy is wrong.\u201d",
      "Trump has said DEI amounts to discrimination. To get colleges to shutter diversity programs, he said during the campaign he would \u201cadvance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "Efforts by colleges to build the diversity they seek on campuses already had been constrained by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that struck down affirmative action in higher education. Many colleges have said they are no less committed to recruiting students of color and helping all students succeed, even if strategies change or go by a different name.",
      "Northeastern changed the name of what had been called \u201cThe Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d to \u201cBelonging in Northeastern,\u201d which it described as a \u201creimagined approach\u201d that embraces everyone at the school.",
      "\u201cWhile internal structures and approaches may need to be adjusted, the university\u2019s core values don\u2019t change. We believe that embracing our differences \u2014 and building a community of belonging \u2014 makes Northeastern stronger,\u201d university spokesperson Renata Nyul said.",
      "The orders are having a chilling effect at many colleges, said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "\u201cWe are also seeing institutions preemptively reevaluating courses, programs and even administrative positions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe long-term consequences of such shifts could be profound, both for higher education and for the broader workforce and society.\u201d",
      "Some changes are outside the control of the colleges.",
      "At Rutgers University, professor Marybeth Gasman awoke Jan. 23 to a contractor's email telling her to cancel an upcoming conference on student internships. The funding, from the Department of Labor, was coming through the contractor and earmarked for DEI programs that were put on hold. About 100 students and staff from historically Black colleges and universities had planned to attend the online session.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a punch in the gut,\u201d said Gasman, who runs Rutgers\u2019 Center for Minority Serving Institutions, which was completing its final project on a $575,000 grant. With the grant frozen, she now hopes to raise the remaining $150,000 from other sources so they can finish the work and retain staff.",
      "Beyond scrutiny of their own policies and programs, many universities and faculty members also are worried about research grants.",
      "The White House this week paused federal grants and loans to conduct an ideological review to uproot progressive initiatives. It later reversed itself, but uncertainty remains over the future of research touching on issues related to diversity.",
      "California Polytechnic professor Cameron Jones said he is worried whether he would still get a $150,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant to study the history of African descendants in early California, even though it\u2019s not a DEI grant. He also worries about the ban\u2019s effect on his students, especially students of color.",

      "President Donald Trump has targeted the rights of transgender people in executive orders in his first two weeks back in office",
      "President Donald Trump has targeted transgender and nonbinary people with a series of executive orders since he returned to office.",
      "He has done it with strong language. In one executive order, he asserted \u201cmedical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "That's a dramatic reversal of the policies of former President Joe Biden's administration \u2014 and of major medical organizations \u2014 that supported gender-affirming care.",
      "American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said that to be put into effect, provisions of the orders should first go through federal rulemaking procedures, which can be years long and include the chance for public comment.",
      "\u201cWhen you have the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief demonizing transgender people, it certainly sends a signal to all Americans,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director at Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Things to know about Trump's actions:",
      "On Trump's first day back in office, he issued a sweeping order that signaled a big change in how his administration would deal with transgender people and their rights.",
      "It questions their existence by saying the government would recognize only two unchangeable sexes: female and male.",
      "The stated purpose is to protect women. \u201cEfforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being,\u201d the order says.",
      "The document calls on government agencies to use the new definitions of the sexes, and to stop using taxpayer money to promote what it calls \u201cgender ideology,\u201d the idea broadly accepted by medical experts that gender falls along a spectrum.",
      "Federal agencies have been quick to comply. Andrea Lucas, the acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for example, announced this week that she would remove identity pronouns from employees' online profiles and disallow the \u201cX\u201d gender marker for those filing discrimination charges.",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\u201d Lucas said in a statement.",
      "On Friday, information about what Trump calls \u201cgender ideology\u201d was removed from federal government websites and the term \u201cgender\u201d was replaced by \u201csex\u201d to comport with the order. The Bureau of Prisons stopped reporting the number of transgender incarcerated people and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary students.",
      "Researchers have found less than 1% of adults identify as transgender and under 2% are intersex, or born with physical traits that don't fit typical definitions for male or female.",
      "In the order calling for a new federal definition of the sexes, Trump included some specific instances in which policy should be changed, including on passports.",
      "The State Department promptly stopped granting requests for new or updated passports with gender markers that don't conform with the new definition.",
      "The agency is no longer issuing the documents with an \u201cX\u201d that some people who identify as neither male nor female request and will not honor requests to change the gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF\u201d for transgender people.",
      "The option to choose \u201cX\u201d was taken off online passport application forms Friday.",
      "The ACLU says it's considering a lawsuit.",
      "Trump's initial order called for transgender women in federal custody to be moved to men's prisons. Warbelow, from Human Rights Campaign, said her organization has received reports from lawyers that some have been.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to requests for information about such moves.",
      "There have been at least two lawsuits trying to block the policy. In one, a federal judge has said a transgender woman in a Massachusetts prison should be housed with the general population of a woman's prison and continue to receive gender-affirming medical care for now.",
      "Trump set the stage for a ban on transgender people in the military, directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to come up with a new policy on the issue by late March.",
      "In the executive order, the president asserted that being transgender \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "Trump barred transgender service members in his first term in office, but a court blocked the effort.",
      "A group of active military members promptly sued over the new order this week.",
      "Trump called for halting the use of federal money to support gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth under 19 years old.",
      "The care in question includes puberty blocking drugs, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, which is rare for minors.",
      "If fully implemented, the order would cut off government health insurance including Medicaid and TRICARE, which serves military families, for the treatments.",
      "It also calls on Congress to adopt a law against the care, though whether that happens is up to lawmakers.",
      "Twenty-six states already have passed laws banning or limiting gender-affirming care for minors, so the change could be smaller in those places.",
      "Some hospitals have paused some gender-affirming care for people under 19 following the executive order while they evaluate how it might apply to them.",
      "Another executive order this week seeks to stop \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d in the nation's school system.",
      "It calls on the Education Department to come up with a policy blocking schools from using federal funds to support students who are socially transitioning or using their curriculum to promote the idea that gender can be fluid, along with certain teachings about race.",
      "The order would block schools from requiring teachers and other school staff to use names and pronouns that align with transgender students' gender identify rather than the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Some districts and states have passed those requirements to prevent deadnaming, the practice of referring to transgender people who have changed their name by the name they used before their transition. It is widely considered insensitive, offensive or traumatizing."

The flight\u2019s final destination was Tijuana after a stop in Missouri. All six people aboard were from Mexico.",
      "The plane crashed Friday 30 seconds after takeoff from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.",
      "Here's what to know about air medical transport:",
      "An air ambulance provides transportation to people in critical or life-threatening situations when a ground ambulance can\u2019t reach a patient or wouldn\u2019t get to them fast enough.",
      "They help boost a patient's odds of surviving and recovering, particularly in rural areas that don't have trauma or burn centers, according to a 2017 U.S. Government Accountability Office report.",
      "They've grown in importance as more rural hospitals have closed, according to a medical journal report from 2022.",
      "Air ambulances can be either a helicopter or a fixed wing aircraft. Helicopters are generally used to take patients between hospitals or from the scene of an accident to a hospital. The airplane versions fly longer distances between airports.",
      "Helicopters make up 74% of all air ambulances, according to the GAO report.",
      "The Philadelphia crash involved a Learjet 55, a small business jet.",
      "People with traumatic injuries, pregnancy complications, heart attacks, strokes and respiratory diseases are the most common users of air ambulances, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. More than 550,000 patients in the U.S. use them every year.",
      "In Hawaii, for example, they are frequently used to take patients from less populated islands, where health care is more limited, to Honolulu, where the state\u2019s biggest hospitals are located.",
      "The owner of the plane that crashed in Philadelphia, Jet Rescue, flew baseball Hall of Famer David Ortiz to Boston after he was shot in the Dominican Republican in 2019.",
      "Air ambulances will often have similar life-saving equipment like ventilators and blood transfusion devices. They will have stretchers and incubators.",
      "The Mayo Clinic, for example, said its air ambulances will have an external defibrillator, an external pacemaker and more than 60 medications.",
      "Paramedics and emergency medical technicians care for patients on board. Sometimes doctors and nurses are on board.",
      "The average air ambulance trip is 52 miles (84 kilometers) and costs between $12,000 and $25,000 per flight, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The medical condition of the patient and the staff on board can influence the price.",
      "Many insurers will pay what they believe to be a reasonable but sometimes they will disagree with the air ambulance provider and in these cases the patient may have to pay the difference.",
      "Insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts.",
      "Yes, there were 87 accidents that led to 230 deaths from 2000 to 2020, according to a study in the journal Prehospital and Disaster Medicine. Nearly three-fourths of those accidents were on helicopters.",
      "Human factors that can include pilot error or disorientation, impairment and fatigue contributed to 87% of the fatal crashes.",
      "The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023, five crewmembers were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside."

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A federal judge on Friday refused to stop what would be the fourth nitrogen gas execution in the U.S., saying the inmate had not proven his claims that the new method is unconstitutionally cruel and causes psychological terror.",
      "Chief District Judge Emily C. Marks rejected Demetrius Frazier\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to either stop his execution on Thursday in Alabama or require that the state give him a sedative before administering the gas.",
      "Marks ruled Frazier had not met the \u201cexceedingly high\u201d legal bar required to win an injunction.",
      "\u201cFrazier fails to meet his burden to establish that the Protocol does create a substantial risk of serious psychological pain such that the Protocol violates the Eighth Amendment,\u201d Marks wrote.",
      "Frazier is scheduled to be executed for the 1991 rape of murder of Pauline Brown. Prosecutors said Frazier broke into Brown\u2019s Birmingham apartment, raped her and shot her in the back of the head.",
      "Alabama became the first state to carry out executions with nitrogen gas when three inmates were put to death using the new method in 2024. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Frazier\u2019s lawyers pointed to descriptions of the state\u2019s first three nitrogen executions to argue the method causes conscious suffocation instead of the swift death that the state promised.",
      "Dr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner and that Grayson appeared conscious for up to three minutes.",
      "Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, described how the men shook on the gurney at the start of their executions.",
      "Marks ruled that the descriptions do not support a finding that any of the men \u201cexperienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\u201d The state has maintained the movements by the inmates may have been involuntary or faked.",
      "However, the judge noted there could be a point that depriving an inmate of oxygen while conscious is unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cNotwithstanding the State\u2019s stubborn refusal at the evidentiary hearing to concede this point, the longer an inmate remains conscious while breathing in nitrogen during an execution, the more likely it becomes that the Eighth Amendment may be violated,\u201d Marks wrote.",
      "Before his conviction in Alabama, Frazier was convicted in Michigan for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life in prison. Michigan does not have the death penalty.",
      "Frazier\u2019s mother made a last-minute plea to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to intervene and request that Frazier be sent back to Michigan to serve the life sentence instead of being executed in Alabama.",
      "\u201cPlease bring my son back to Michigan. Please don\u2019t let Alabama kill my son if you can stop it,\u201d Carol Frazier wrote in the letter to Whitmer.",

      "A woman who was accused of fatally poisoning her boss has had her manslaughter conviction overturned",
      "ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- A woman accused of fatally poisoning her boss had her manslaughter conviction overturned Friday. A New York appeals court said improperly obtained evidence from her cell phone was used against her.",
      "Kaitlyn Conley has been serving a 23-year sentence in the 2015 death of chiropractor Dr. Mary Yoder, a case that spurred a documentary series.",
      "\u201cMs. Conley is looking forward to clearing her name,\u201d appeals lawyer Melissa Swartz said in an email.",
      "She said Conley will be transported back to Oneida County for prosecutors to say whether they plan to pursue the case. A message seeking comment was sent Friday to the Oneida County district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Conley, now 31, was a receptionist in Yoder's office in Whitesboro, a village in central New York, and had dated Yoder's son.",
      "Authorities said Conley poisoned Yoder, 60, with an anti-inflammatory drug called colchicine. Conley has said she's innocent.",
      "\u201cI did not kill Mary Yoder,\u201d Conley said in an ABC News Studios series, \u201cLittle Miss Innocent,\u201d that was shown on Hulu last fall. She added: \u201cI put all my faith and all my trust in the system and these people, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Conley's first trial ended in a hung jury. At a 2017 retrial, she was acquitted of murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter.",
      "A mid-level state appeals court ruled Friday that investigators went beyond what their warrant allowed when they had a cybersecurity center search Conley's cell phone. The search found references to the words \u201cpoison\u201d and \u201ccolchicine\u201d and ties to an email account used to acquire colchicine, according to the court.",
      "\u201cA person\u2019s cell phone now contains at least as much personal and private information as their home and, thus, indiscriminate searches of cell phones cannot be permitted,\u201d a five-judge panel of state Appellate Division judges wrote."

      "Just a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D",
      "Just a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., employees at the Federal Aviation Administration were sent an offer to resign with eight months' pay.",
      "The union for air traffic controllers recommended to its members that they not accept Tuesday\u2019s offer, because the FAA had not decided which positions would be included in the resignation plan. An official for the Office for Personnel Management, the U.S. government's human resources arm, said Friday that controllers weren't eligible for the resignation plan or subject to the hiring freeze across much of the rest of federal government.",
      "The crash Wednesday that killed all 67 people on board an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter has renewed focus on the real-world implications of President Donald Trump's push to slash the federal bureaucracy.",
      "There's no evidence that the White House effort to downsize government played any role in the collision, with shortages of air traffic controllers long predating Trump taking office. But those who\u2019ve worked in air safety say that those who try to dramatically shake up the federal workforce need to remember that lives are on the line.",
      "\u201cIt concerns me that there are people who don\u2019t want to reform or restructure institutions, they want to destroy institutions,\u201d said James Hall, who was head of the National Transportation Safety Board under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. \u201cThe American people enjoy the safest aviation system in the world. I don\u2019t doubt there should be changes in government, but someone should remember the old adage to look before you leap.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, as the investigation into the crash was well underway, FAA employees were among the federal workers who received an email telling them to quit and find more useful work.",
      "\u201cThe way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,\u201d read the memo from OPM.",
      "An official with OPM, which made the resignation offers, said air traffic controllers are exempt from a hiring freeze that Trump announced on taking office on Jan. 20 and they are not eligible for a buyout even though they were sent the offer. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal government operations.",
      "It was unclear if the controllers themselves have been notified by OPM whether they are exempt. After the initial offer went out, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association recommended in an email to its union members not to submit a request for the resignation until more information was available. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the union email.",
      "NATCA President Nick Daniels said officials had not explained to the union the details of how its employees would be affected by the retirement program.",
      "\u201cNATCA has not received a briefing on how or whether the deferred resignation program will be implemented in the FAA,\" Daniels said in a statement provided to the AP Friday.",
      "\u201cIt is not yet clear how this program will affect aviation safety workers represented by our Union,\u201d he added. \"However, we are concerned about the potential effect to public safety and the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic control system if FAA were to lose experienced aviation safety personnel during a universally recognized air traffic controller staffing shortage.\u201d",
      "Though the new administration insists its cost-cutting will exempt public safety workers and keep citizens safe, its rhetoric and approach have been more sweeping than surgical.",
      "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the technology mogul Trump tapped to lead the effort, has said \u201cbureaucracy is killing America\u201d and repeatedly called for massive, across-the-board reductions in the federal workforce. Trump and his supporters have made personal loyalty to the president a top priority in hiring new workers or keeping existing ones.",
      "During the campaign, Musk demanded the resignation of FAA administrator Michael Whitaker, who clashed with Musk over regulating SpaceX and stepped down the day before Trump took office. That left the FAA leaderless until Trump, at a Thursday press conference after the crash, named an acting head of the agency.",
      "Trump blamed diversity hiring after the crash \u2014 despite no evidence about the qualifications of anyone involved in the collision \u2014 and alleged that former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama lowered standards to meet racial or other quotas. He decried an FAA diversity policy that existed during his first administration.",
      "Though the Trump administration talks about the need to shed federal workers, the government has been desperate to hire air traffic controllers for nearly a decade. The FAA has struggled to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of commercial flights, even as there had been no fatal air accidents since 2009. Last year, Biden pushed for funding to hire 2,000 more controllers and announced the hiring of 1,800 controllers in September.",
      "An FAA report obtained by the AP said that air traffic control staffing at the airport Wednesday \u201cwas not normal,\u201d with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision. A person familiar with the matter noted that the positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.",
      "Don Kettl, an emeritus professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, warned that it is likely to become even harder to recruit those sorely needed air traffic controllers now.",
      "\u201cThe fact that there's so much uncertainty in such a short time period and the fact that the president personally seems to have blamed them,\u201d Kettl said, \"is bound to make it more difficult to hire more controllers.\"",
      "Kettl warned that there are many critical, demanding and high-skilled government jobs that are already tough to fill \u2014 from food safety inspectors to surgeons at Veterans Administration hospitals \u2014 and that may get even tougher now.",
      "\u201cThe fiber of government is woven throughout our lives,\u201d Kettl said. \u201cIf you downgrade the capacity, you downgrade what you get.\u201d",

      "U.S. officials say the Pentagon is readying orders for the deployment of at least 1,000 additional active duty troops to bolster President Donald Trump\u2019s expanding crackdown on immigration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is readying orders for the deployment of at least 1,000 additional active duty troops to bolster President Donald Trump's expanding crackdown on immigration, U.S. officials said Friday.",
      "They said roughly 500 more soldiers \u2014 largely a headquarters unit from the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum in New York \u2014 will be sent to the southwest border. And about 500 Marines will go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where some of the detained migrants will be held.",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because announcements have not been made, said there have been ongoing discussions about the deployments and the numbers could increase if additional details are worked out.",
      "The Pentagon has been scrambling to put in motion Trump\u2019s executive orders signed shortly after he took office on Jan. 20. The first group of 1,600 active duty troops deployed to the border last week.",
      "The deployments reflect Trump's determination to expand the military's role in his campaign to shut down the border and send detained migrants back to their home countries.",
      "Troops going to the border are expected to help put in place concertina wire barriers and provide needed transportation, intelligence and other support to the Border Patrol. Troops going to Guantanamo could help prepare the facility for an influx of migrants and do other support duties.",
      "Speaking on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Friday morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he believes the U.S. can get \u201cthousands of individuals in tents, secured in places at Guantanamo Bay.\u201d",
      "But he also said there\u2019s the possibility that hardened criminals or violent gang members could also be housed there. As a result, he said the Defense Department is preparing detention facilities at Guantanamo \u201cthat are basically supermax prisons\u201d to be used to hold them temporarily.",
      "Officials have been saying all week that there are likely to be additional troop deployments to help secure the southern border \u2014 potentially rolling out rapidly in the coming days. The eventual total deployed could be as many as 10,000.",
      "Before Trump returned to the White House, there were already about 2,500 Guard and Reserve forces consistently deployed to the border. Officials noted that given the length of the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, it will take additional forces to help put large rolls of concertina wire barriers in place and provide support to the Border Patrol.",
      "The roughly 1,100 Army soldiers and 500 Marines ordered to deploy to the border last week have all arrived in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, and many have already begun work.",
      "Separately, the U.S. military is providing military aircraft for Department of Homeland Security deportation flights for more than 5,000 detained migrants. At least some of those are expected to go to the detention center at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said his administration planned to send the \u201cworst criminal aliens\u201d to Guantanamo. He ordered the Pentagon to prepare to hold up to 30,000 migrants. He said some of the migrants can\u2019t be trusted to stay in their home countries once they are sent back.",
      "\u201cSome of them are so bad that we don\u2019t even trust the countries to hold them because we don\u2019t want them coming back, so we\u2019re gonna send \u2019em out to Guantanamo,\u201d Trump said.",
      "This is not the first time migrants would be held at Guantanamo. U.S. authorities have detained migrants intercepted at sea at a facility known as the Migrant Operations Center, including people from Haiti and Cuba."

      "An information technology expert who for decades assumed the identity of another man so convincingly that his victim was forcibly medicated and jailed for identity theft himself was sentenced Friday to 12 years in prison.",
      "Matthew David Keirans, 59, of Hartland, Wisconsin, pleaded guilty last April to federal charges of aggravated identify theft and making false statements to a National Credit Union Administration insured institution.",
      "The charges shocked Keirans\u2019 family and friends, who described him in letters to the court as kind, gracious and dependable. His victim, William Woods, said Keirans' guilty plea spelled the end of a yearslong nightmare.",
      "Woods said Keirans tried to make him look like the criminal.",
      "\u201cHe deserved to get every bit of what he got from the judge,\u201d Woods said after the sentencing.",
      "Court records indicate Keirans had a rocky childhood, ran away from home at 16, stole a car in San Francisco and was arrested in Oregon but never appeared in court.",
      "The two men met in the late 1980s while working at a hot dog cart in Albuquerque, New Mexico, court records show.",
      "Woods said Keirans stole his wallet in 1988, but returned it after Woods threatened to punch him.",
      "But while Keirans had possession of Woods' wallet, he used the information on Woods' social security card to apply for a driver's license as William Woods.",
      "At that point, \"he\u2019s got my name with his face on an ID card,\u201d Woods told The Associated Press.",
      "There is no record of Keirans using his real name or social security number after 1988. Court documents show he publicly assumed the name William Woods in 1990.",
      "Over the years, Keirans married and had a child, all as Woods. He worked at the University of Iowa Hospital and used Woods\u2019 ID to secure credit union loans in Iowa totaling more than $200,000, prosecutors said.",
      "Woods, meanwhile, wasn't earning enough to file taxes \u2014 around $3,000 a year at the time, but he wasn't completely under the radar. In 2015, Yousef Saleh Erakat, a YouTuber known as FouseyTube, found Woods living on the street and created a series of videos with more than 1 million views each that document Erakat giving Woods food and paying for him to stay in a motel.",
      "Woods used money Fousey gave him to pay for a credit-monitoring service, and learned that someone was racking up debt and opening accounts under his name. Outraged, Woods marched into a Los Angeles bank in 2019 and demanded an end to it.",
      "\u201cThe guy is fraudulent,\u201d Woods recalled saying.",
      "The branch manager asked Woods a series of security questions that he was unable to answer because the answers had been set by Keirans. Then the bank called the police, court records say. Keirans, whom the bank believed was Woods, told police that no one in California had permission to access his accounts.",
      "\u201cSuspect entered bank and attempted to use victim\u2019s personal identification to gain access to victim\u2019s bank account,\u201d the arrest report said.",
      "The real Woods was then charged with identity theft and false impersonation.",
      "Keirans' attorney argued in a court filing that Woods tried to steal thousands of dollars from his client, and described Woods as a \u201cwrongdoer whose own conduct should mitigate any sympathy felt for him.\u201d",
      "Woods is identified in court records from that time as Matthew Kierans, misspelling his tormentor\u2019s name. There's no record of how or why authorities came to identify him as such.",
      "Woods told police the names of his relatives, and even offered to call the owner of the hot dog cart to prove his identity.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d Woods said. He said the YouTube videos also proved his identity.",
      "As Woods repeatedly disputed the identity authorities foisted upon him, a California judge found him not mentally competent to stand trial and sent him to a state mental hospital, where he received psychotropic medication, court records show.",
      "Woods spent 428 days in county jail and 147 days in the mental hospital. He was released after agreeing to a no-contest plea \u2014 a case that has since been vacated. The Los Angeles County Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office declined to comment.",
      "Freed, Woods began a crusade to regain his identity, filing a string of reports. When he reached out to the University of Iowa Hospital, where Keirans was earning more than $100,000 a year, hospital security called the police.",
      "Keirans initially told police that the victim \u201cneeded help and should be locked up,\u201d federal prosecutors said. But a detective tracked down the biological father listed on Woods\u2019 birth certificate and tested his DNA to confirm that Woods was his son.",
      "\u201cMy life is over,\" Keirans said, when confronted with the results.",
      "Woods is now back living in Albuquerque where he works as a landscaper. He said he plans to seek compensation for his wrongful incarceration.",

      "The Trump administration says it's in talks with El Salvador to revive an agreement that could allow the United States to send non-Salvadoran migrants to the Central American country",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- The Trump administration said Friday it was in talks with El Salvador to revive an agreement that could allow the United States to send non-Salvadoran migrants to the Central American country.",
      "This time, though, the government would also aim to send members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to Salvadoran prisons, said Mauricio Claver-Carone, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Latin America, in a call with media outlets.",
      "It comes after a harsh crackdown on the country's gangs by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Bukele suspended key constitutional rights in 2022 and arrested 84,000 people, more than 1% of the country\u2019s population. The majority of them remain in prison without being sentenced.",
      "Bukele\u2019s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The crackdown has fueled human rights criticisms but has resulted in a sharp drop in violence in El Salvador, once plagued by the warring Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 gangs.",
      "Despite concerns over democracy, Bukele has drawn the admiration of many American right-wing figures. Simultaneously, the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua has also become a buzzword for Trump in speeches and politicians on the right.",
      "\u201cIf we commit to reviving this agreement and include ... members of the Tren de Aragua gang, I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Claver-Carone spoke about the talks ahead of Secretary of State Marco Rubio 's trip to Latin America. Rubio is set to visit El Salvador on Monday between visits to Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Top on the agenda is migration, and Rubio is likely to push allies like Bukele to help the Trump administration in its migratory crackdown and to accept migrants from countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba that largely don't accept deportation flights from the U.S.",
      "Claver-Carone provided few additional details about what \u201creviving\u201d the agreement would entail. Trump in 2019 carried out a program known as \u201cSafe Third Countries.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump reached agreements that would require people to apply for protective status in countries deemed \u201csafe\u201d that they passed through before reaching the U.S. border.",
      "But it was sharply criticized as a way to cut off access for people to apply for asylum in the U.S. There were also doubts about the safety of vulnerable people in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, countries terrorized by gangs that often prey on vulnerable migrants.",
      "Reviving the program would just be the latest step by Trump in slashing access to asylum after a slate of executive actions in his first days in office.",
      "In the Friday call, Claver-Carone also called Bukele \u201cthe most consequential president in the region\u201d and an \u201cally\u201d on migration issues.",
      "As Salvadoran migration to the U.S. dipped in recent years, Bukele has taken steps to block migrants from passing through the country on the way to the U.S. amid pressures from the Biden administration. As he did, the Biden administration toned down criticisms of Bukele after warning of democratic backsliding in El Salvador."

    "story": [
      "A hiss and puff of compressed air shapes the smooth leather, bringing to life an all-American cowboy boot in a factory on China's eastern coast.",
      "Then comes another one as the assembly line continues, the sounds of sewing, stitching, cutting and soldering echoing off the high ceilings.",
      "\"We used to sell around a million pairs of boots a year,\" says the 45-year-old sales manager, Mr Peng, who did not wish to reveal his first name.",
      "That is, until Donald Trump came along.",
      "A slew of tariffs in his first presidential term triggered a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Six years on, Chinese businesses are bracing themselves for a sequel now that he is back in the White House.",
      "\"What direction should we take in the future?\" Mr Peng asks, uncertain of what Trump 2.0 means for him, his colleagues - and China.",
      "A battle looms",
      "For Western markets that are increasingly wary of Beijing's ambitions, trade has become a powerful bargaining chip - especially as a sluggish Chinese economy relies ever more on exports. Trump returned on a campaign promise that included crushing tariffs against Chinese-made goods, and has since threatened a 10% levy that is expected to take effect on 1 February.",
      "He has also ordered a review of US-China trade - which buys Beijing time and Washington, negotiating room. And for now, harsher rhetoric (and higher tariffs) seems to be directed against US allies such as Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump may have pressed pause on the looming battle with Beijing. But many believe it's still coming. It's hard to find an exact figure on how many businesses are fleeing China, but major firms such as Nike, Adidas and Puma have already relocated to Vietnam. Chinese businesses too have been moving, reshaping supply chains, although Beijing remains a key player.",
      "Mr Peng says his boss, who owns the factory, has considered moving production to South East Asia, along with many of their competitors.",
      "It would save the firm, but they would lose their workforce. Most of the staff are from the nearby city of Nantong and have worked here for more than 20 years.",
      "Mr Peng, whose wife died when their son was young, says the factory has been his family: \"Our boss is determined not to abandon these employees.\"",
      "He is aware of the geopolitics at play, but he says he and his workers are just trying to make a living. They are still reeling from the impact of 2019, when a fourth round of Trump tariffs - 15% - hit Chinese-made consumer goods, such as clothes and shoes.",
      "Orders have since dwindled and staff numbers, once more than 500, have dropped to just over 200. The evidence is in the empty work stations, as Mr Peng shows us around.",
      "All around him, workers are cutting the leather into the right shape to hand it to the machinist. They have to be precise because mistakes will ruin the expensive leather, most of which has been imported from the US.",
      "The factory is trying to keep costs low as some of their American buyers are already considering moving business away from China and the threat of tariffs.",
      "But that would mean losing skilled workers: it can take up to a week to make one pair of boots, from flattening the leather to giving the finished boots a final polish and packing them for export.",
      "This is what turned China into the world's top manufacturer - labour-intensive production which is also cheap when it's scaled up and supported by an unrivalled supply chain. And this has been years in the making.",
      "\"It was once a constant cycle of inspecting goods and shipping them out - I felt fulfilled,\" says Mr Peng, who has worked here since 2015. \"But orders have decreased, which makes me feel quite lost and anxious.\"",
      "Once crafted to conquer the Wild West, these cowboy boots have been made here for more than a decade. And this is a familiar story in the south of Jiangsu province, a manfucaturing hub along the Yangtze River that produces just about everything, from textiles to electric vehicles.",
      "These are among the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods that China ships to the United States every year - a number that steadily ballooned as Washington became its biggest trading partner.",
      "That status slipped under Trump. But it was not restored under his successor Joe Biden, who kept most Trump-era tariffs in place, as ties with Beijing frayed.",
      "In fact, the European Union too has imposed tariffs on electric vehicle imports, accusing China of making too much, often with the support of state subsidies. Trump has echoed this - that China's \"unfair\" trade practices disadvantage foreign comeptitors.",
      "Beijing sees such rhetoric as Western attempts to stifle its growth, and it has repeatedly warned Washington that there will be no winners in a trade war. But it has also said it's ready to talk and \"properly handle differences\".",
      "And President Trump, who has described tariffs as his \"one big power\" over China, certainly wants to talk.",
      "It's unclear as yet what he might want in return. During Trump's honeymoon period with China in his first term he came to Beijing to ask for Xi's help in meeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. This time it is believed he might need Xi's support to make a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. He recently said that China had \"a great deal of power over that situation\".",
      "The threat of a 10% tariff is driven by the belief that China is \"sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada\". So he could demand that it do more to end that flow.",
      "Or, given he welcomed a bidding war over TikTok, he may want to negotiate its ownership - or the prized technology that powers the app - because Beijing would need to agree to any such sale.",
      "Whatever the deal may be, it could help reset US-China ties. However, the absence of one could abruptly end the chance of a second honeymoon, setting up Trump and Xi for a far more confrontational relationship.",
      "Already business sentiment is nervous: an annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China showed just over half of them were concerned about the US-China relationship deteriorating further.",
      "Trump's seemingly softer stance on China offers offers some relief. But his hope is still that the threat of tariffs will help drive buyers away from China and move manufacturing back to the US.",
      "Some Chinese businesses are indeed on the move - but not to America.",
      "Moving shop",
      "An hour outside Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, businessman Huang Zhaodong has built a new factory to cater to a flood of orders from US giants Walmart and Costco.",
      "This is his second factory in Cambodia, and together they produce half a million garments a month, from shirts to underwear. Hangers carrying cotton trousers roll past us on an automated line, moving from one station to the next as the elastic waist is inserted and hemlines are finished.",
      "Now, when prospective US customers lob the first question, which he has come to expect -  where is he based - Mr Huang has the right answer. Not in China.",
      "\"In the case of some Chinese firms, their customers have told them: 'If you don't move production overseas, I'll cancel your orders'.\"",
      "The tariffs raise tough choices for suppliers and retailers, but it's not always clear who will bear the brunt of the cost. Sometimes it will be the customer, Mr Huang says.",
      "\"Take Walmart as an example. I sell them clothes at $5, but they usually mark it up 3.5 times. If the cost increases due to higher tariffs, the price I sell to them might rise to $6. If they mark it up by 3.5 times, the retail price would increase.\"",
      "But usually, he says, it is the supplier. If his production line was in China, he estimates an extra 10% tariff could take an extra $800,000 (\u00a3644,000) from his earnings.",
      "\"That's more than what I make as profit. It's huge and we can't afford it. If you're making clothes in China under such tariff conditions, it's unsustainable,\" he says.",
      "Current US tariffs on Chinese goods vary from 100% on electric vehicles to 25% on steel and aluminium. Until now, several top-selling items have been exempt, including electronics, such as TVs and iPhones.",
      "But the 10% blanket tariff Trump is proposing could affect the price of everything that is made in China and exported to the US. That applies to a lot of things - from toys and tea cups to laptops.",
      "Mr Huang says this would encourage more factories to move elsewhere. Several new workshops have sprung up around him and Chinese companies from textile production heartlands such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong are moving in to make winter jackets and woollen clothing.",
      "Around 90% of clothing factories in Cambodia are now Chinese-run or Chinese-owned, according to a report by insight and analysis group Research and Markets.",
      "Half of the country's foreign investment flows from China. Seventy percent of roads and bridges were built using loans Beijing dispensed, according to Chinese state media.",
      "Many of the signs on restaurants and shops are in Chinese as well as Khmer, the local language. There's even a ring road named Xi Jinping Boulevard in honour of the Chinese president.",
      "Cambodia is not a lone recipient. China has invested heavily in different parts of the world under President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative - a trade and infrastructure project that also increases Beijing's influence.",
      "That means China has choices.",
      "Chinese state media claims that more than half of China's imports and exports now come from Belt and Road countries, most of them in South East Asia.",
      "This has not happened overnight, says Kenny Yao from AlixPartners, who advises Chinese firms on how to deal with tariffs.",
      "During Trump's first term, many Chinese firms doubted his tariff threat, he told the BBC. Now they ask if he will follow the supply chain and slap tariffs on other countries.",
      "Just in case he does, Mr Yao says, it would be wise for Chinese businesses to look further afield: \"For example, Africa or Latin America. This is more difficult, but it is good to look at areas you have not explored before.\"",
      "As America pledges to look after itself first, Beijing is doing its best to appear a stable business partner, and there is some evidence it is working.",
      "China has edged past the US to become the prevailing choice for countries in South East Asia, according to a survey by the Iseas Yusof-Ishak think tank in Singapore.",
      "Even though production has moved abroad, money still flows to China - 60% of the materials being made into clothes at Mr Huang's factories in Phnom Penh come from China.",
      "And exports are thriving, with Beijing investing more heavily in high-end manufacturing, from solar panels to artificial intelligence. Last year's trade surplus with the world - on the back of a nearly 6% year-on-year jump in exports - was a record $992bn.",
      "Still,  Chinese businesses - in Jiangsu and Phnom Penh - are preparing themselves for an uncertain spell, if not a turbulent one.",
      "Mr Peng hopes the US and China can have an \"amicable and calm\" discussion to keep the tariffs \"within a reasonable range\" and avoid a trade war.",

      "AstraZeneca has scrapped plans to invest \u00a3450m in expanding a vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside, blaming a reduction in government support.",
      "The pharmaceutical giant announced its decision just two days after Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out Labour's plan to go \"further and faster\" to boost economic growth.",
      "AstraZeneca said that after \"protracted\" talks, a number of factors influenced the move, including \"the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal\".",

      "It is a practice known as \"back billing\", but sending a bill for energy that was used more than 12 months ago was outlawed by regulator Ofgem in 2018.",
      "But Radio 4's Money Box has learned that 3,308 people complained to the energy ombudsman about receiving these so-called \"back bills\" in the 12 months to September 2024.",
      "The actual number of people complaining about back billing is likely to be much higher because only cases that cannot be resolved by suppliers in the first instance get as far as the ombudsman.",
      "Citizens Advice received 47,000 complaints about billing in general in 2023, rising to nearly 60,000 in 2024.",

      "The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices.",
      "Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.",
      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electronic current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's taking the mick, is my view.\"",
      "There is limited evidence regarding the health effects of heated tobacco, according to Prof Lion Shahab, co-director of the tobacco and alcohol research group at University College, London.",

      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

      "In a landmark case, the court handed the company's British former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright, who has also competed as a racing driver, a 32-month jail sentence and fined the company $148m (\u00a3119m).",
      "This is the first time an entire company has been charged by Switzerland's highest court, and bribery convictions of senior staff are rare.",
      "Trafigura's lawyers said the company and Wainwright intended to appeal against the verdict, so the former executive was not jailed immediately.",
      "The case against Trafigura has had all the elements of a financial thriller: millions of dollars, shady middlemen and a chain of shell companies located in offshore havens like the Virgin Islands.",
      "Trafigura's strategy, the court heard, was to set up a complex payment web, through which an official with Angola's state oil company was paid almost $5m (\u00a34.02m; \u20ac4.81) between 2009 and 2011.",
      "Documents presented to the court by Swiss prosecutors showed payments authorised on Trafigura's own headed notepaper.",
      "The strategy appeared to work: over the next few years, the court heard, Angola signed contracts with Trafigura worth almost $144m (\u00a3115.93; \u20ac138.56).",
      "Trafigura, whose lawyers appeared bullish before the verdict, denied bribery. The company said its own compliance and anti-corruption measures had been independently assessed and found to be excellent.",
      "But the sheer weight of the evidence - which included dozens of documents, emails and memos - revealed a different picture: strict anti-corruption measures on paper but an intricate structure set up to evade those measures in reality.

      "They brought the charges to Switzerland's highest court, reserved for the worst crimes, such as terrorist offences.",
      "Trafigura now faces a large fine and Wainwright, who was in court for the verdict and denied the charges, was told he must serve at least one year of his 32 month sentence in jail.",

    "summary": "A trade body calls the rise in alcohol tax a \"bitter blow\", but there is better news for pub-goers.",
    "story": [
      "The price of wine and spirits is set to rise from Saturday after an increase in tax and duties comes into effect.",
      "Taxes will rise in line with inflation, and a new system of duties based on the strength of drinks will also come into effect.",
      "A trade body for the industry called the changes a \"bitter blow\", saying the duty on a bottle of 14.5% ABV (alcohol by volume) red wine will rise by 54p, and go up by 32p on a bottle of gin.",
      "There is some better news for pub-goers, as a small cut in duty on draught pints will also come into effect.",
      "The 1.7% tax drop on the production of draught alcohol, which was announced in last year's Budget, is the first such cut in a decade.",
      "The relief applies to draught drinks below 8.5% ABV, which equates to a 1p tax cut on an average-strength pint.",
      "Businesses 'squeezed'",
      "From Saturday, the alcohol tax will rise by 3.6%, in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.",
      "There will also be further increases in duty for some drinks, depending on their strength.",
      "A new system of duties based on strength was introduced in August 2023, although some wines were given a temporary reprieve. This relief is now ending.",
      "The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) says the changes mean duty on a 14.5% ABV bottle of red wine will have risen by 98p over the past 18 months.",
      "The WTSA argues that the tax rises are self-defeating for the government, as revenues from alcohol tax are lower than the previous year.",
      "\"The government continues to claim that the tax hikes are part of their big plan to plug the black hole in the public finances, but a series of record-breaking tax levies are doing the exact opposite,\" said WSTA chief executive Miles Beale.",
      "\"There are no winners under the UK's punishing alcohol tax regime \u2013 higher duty rates mean people buy less which results in reduced income to the Exchequer, businesses are being squeezed and consumers have to pay more.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The alcohol duty reforms have modernised and simplified the duty system, prioritising public health and incentivising consumption of lower strength products.\"",
      "As well as cutting the tax on draught alcohol, the government is also increasing small producer relief for products which are below 8.5% ABV. The relief tapers away as production is increased.",
      "The Society of Independent Brewers and Associates said the policies would help pubs compete against cheap alcohol sold in supermarkets.",
      "The government says the two measures are worth \u00a385m and the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, said they would help \"boost sector growth\".",
      "However, critics have said other government policies - including the forthcoming rise in employers' National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the increase in the minimum wage - mean pint prices will have to go up as pubs pass on higher costs to customers.",
      "'April cliff edge'",
      "The government has said the rise in employers' NICs was needed to fix the public finances.",
      "But some pub owners have said they are looking at a 30p to 40p increase on a pint because of higher employment costs.",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",

    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",

      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",

      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",

      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump",
      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

      "Children who took part in riots last summer were primarily driven by curiosity and the \"thrill of the moment\", rather than far-right ideology and social media misinformation, the children's commissioner for England has said.",
      "Deep distrust in the police and a lack of opportunities were also behind some children's decisions to take part, a new report suggests.",

      "A government spokesperson said the mobilisation of the police and criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order.",
      "But Dame Rachel de Souza told BBC Radio 5 Live that judges should have the power to wipe criminal records clean where youths had \"done their time for some very silly things\".",
      "Her report said her interviews with children charged over the disorder \"paints a more complex picture\" about why they had become involved.",
      "'Real regret'",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC One's Breakfast programme children who had turned up after hearing about the riots had been \"egged on\" by \"adults who were extremist and were really there to do terrible things\".",
      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",

      "Riots in which mosques and hotels housing migrants were attacked soon spread to many other towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the violence at the time as \"far-right thuggery\" and promised that those involved would \"face the full force of the law\".",
      "The children's commissioner's report said at least 147 children had been arrested and 84 charged since the riots, with some as young as 12 sentenced over their involvement.",
      "Dame Rachel said her interviews with 14 of those \"unheard and overlooked\" children \"raise some really serious questions about childhood in England and why our children feel so disaffected and disempowered\".",

      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",

      "Among them is Mila, who said she \"felt better\" and \"less stressed\" without the worry of it going off in class.",
      "Another pupil, Elliot, said his phone was a \"really big distraction\" and he had chosen to hand it in so he did not have to \"think about it all day\".",
      "At the start of the next school year, the scheme will be compulsory for Year 7s and it may be rolled out to older year groups as well.",
      "Mr Beveridge said headteachers across Solihull wanted to take \"collective action\" on the issue, which is why they had written a letter to parents.",
      "It is not about being negative about technology, he added, but about making sure that everyone was aware of the risks.",
      "\"The hope is that sooner or later it will be the social norm not to buy a smartphone until young people are at least 14, maybe older.",

      "Among those speaking will be Harriet, who is in Year 13 at Alderbrook Sixth Form.",
      "She said she had had a phone since she was 11 years old, describing it as a \"necessity\".",
      "But the 17-year-old said they were a \"huge distraction\" and said it was \"crazy\" that she had to use an app to lock her phone and all her apps when she was revising.",
      "She said she had also experienced the \"darker side\" of the technology when last year a man had airdropped inappropriate photos to her at a bus stop.",
      "\"As girls you have to deal with that added pressure,\" she said.",
      "The event had been partly organised by Claire Smith, the principal of nearby Tudor Grange Academy, which has been a phone-free school for many years.",

      "Here's everything you need to know about the ceremony.",
      "1) Who's going to win album of the year?",

      "During last year's ceremony, her husband Jay-Z addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's latest record, Cowboy Carter, is a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. It's the sort of thing that delights Grammy voters, who traditionally prefer albums that elevate America's musical history over contemporary, cutting-edge productions.",

      "Charli XCX's Brat is a career-defining pop record that became a cultural phenomenon. The best-reviewed album of 2024, it's probably too abrasive for the Grammys' more conservative voters, but that's their loss.",
      "And you'd have to be crazy to ignore Taylor Swift. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, was the biggest-seller of last year; a fact that will undoubtedly be taken into account, even if the record is one of her weaker efforts.",
      "If she wins, Swift will collect her fifth album of the year trophy - more than any other artist in Grammy history.",
      "2) What about the other big prizes?",
      "One of the year's most stacked categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".",
      "Aside from a rogue nomination for The Beatles (see below), the shortlist reflects a stellar year for pop music, with Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and Charli XCX's 360 up against Beyonc\u00e9's Texas Hold 'Em and Billie Eilish's Birds Of A Feather.",
      "But the front-runner is Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. A furious take-down of his rap nemesis, Drake, it's as catchy as it is legally contentious. If it wins, it would be only the second hip-hop single to win the category, following Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019.",
      "In the parallel song of the year prize - which recognises achievement in songwriting - the smart money is on Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With A Smile.",
      "Both artists are perennial Grammy favourites, and their virtuoso ballad will be catnip to voters.",
      "Their competition includes Shaboozey's A Bar Song (Tipsy), which was America's longest-running number one single of 2024. However, the fact that it's based on a previous hit (J-Kwon's Tipsy) is likely to count against it.",
      "Chappell Roan's breakout single Good Luck Babe is another strong contender, notable for its soaring high notes and a piercing lyric that skewers internalised homophobia. Billie Eilish's gossamer ballad Birds of a Feather is a similar masterclass in songcraft - making this category one of the hardest to predict.",
      "By contrast, the coveted best new artist prize is pretty much a two-way split between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, both of whom established a dominant chart presence in 2024 after years on the pop sidelines.",
      "That's bad news for the sole British nominee, six-time Brit Award winner Raye. But at least she's in good company, alongside breakout rap star Doechii and big-hearted pop singer Teddy Swims.",

      "3) Which Grammy records could be broken?",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter has 11 nominations, potentially making it the most-rewarded album in Grammy history.",
      "The record is currently held by Santana, who got nine trophies for his album Supernatural in 2000 (coincidentally, the same year that Beyonc\u00e9 received her first Grammy nomination, as part of Destiny's Child).",
      "And if Cowboy Carter doesn't take home best album, Beyonc\u00e9 still breaks a record, for the most nominations in that category without a win.",
      "Billie Eilish could become the first female artist to win Record of the Year three times with Birds of a Feather. Paul Simon and Bruno Mars are the only other artist with three wins in the category.",
      "Rapper turned flautist Andr\u00e9 3000 is also poised to make history. If he wins best instrumental composition, he does so with the longest song title in Grammy history: I Swear, I Really Wanted To Make A 'Rap' Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time.",
      "The current record holders, in case you were wondering, are Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips. In 2007, they won best rock instrumental performance for the magnificently-titled The Wizard Turns on the Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins.",
      "4) Who votes for the Grammys?",
      "More than 13,000 members of the Recording Academy vote for the Grammys every year - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write CD liner notes.",
      "To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (\u00a3120). All former winners are also eligible to vote.",
      "Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.",
      "Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.",
      "The 2025 awards recognise music released between 16 September 2023 and 30 August, 2024. The winners are not revealed until the ceremony.",
      "5) How did The Beatles get nominated?",
      "The Beatles might have broken up 55 years ago, but they're up for two prizes on Sunday: record of the year and best rock performance.",
      "Both nominations recognise Now and Then, a song that John Lennon demoed in the 1970s, and which was finally completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr last year.",
      "Grammy voters, with their eyes firmly trained on the past, rarely miss an opportunity to reward the Beatles. Eight years ago, for example, the band's documentary Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years beat Beyonc\u00e9's groundbreaking Lemonade for best music film.",
      "In some ways, that's correcting an historic wrong. In their prime, the Beatles were nominated for record of the year four times - for I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be - but lost every time.",
      "A win in 2025 would prove that Beatlemania never fades - but voters may be put off by The Beatles' use of machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence), which was used to clean up Lennon's scratchy old cassette recordings.",
      "The Recording Academy's rules on AI say that \"only human creators\" can win Grammys, and that \"the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful\".",
      "That's true in the case of Now And Then, but many creators remain sceptical of the technology.",
      "6) How will the California wildfires affect the ceremony?",
      "Quite a lot.",
      "All the hoopla surrounding the Grammys has gone. No pre-parties, no after-parties. Everything except the ceremony itself has been cancelled. All the money that would have been spent on champagne and vol au vents is being funnelled into relief efforts.",
      "The Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity have also set up a Fire Relief fund, which has so far pledged more than $3.2 million (\u00a32.6 million) in emergency aid to assist music professionals affected by the fires.",
      "And the telecast itself will reflect the devastation, with segments honouring the first responders who risked their lives to tackle the inferno and protect the vulnerable.",
      "\"We'll still have performances, we'll still have awards and honour music,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason, Jr told Variety magazine.",
      "\"But you'll know that something's happened, and you'll know that we're using music to do good.\"",
      "7) Is there a list of Grammy performers?",

      "8) How can I watch in the UK?",
      "The ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.",
      "It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.",
      "You can watch the whole thing on the Recording Academy's YouTube channel, and on live.grammy.com.",
      "That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00  in the UK.",
      "Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's  broadcast live in the US on CBS and streamed internationally on Paramount Plus. Speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",
      "9) Does any of this really matter?",
      "Of course not! But have you seen what's going on everywhere else in the world?",
      "Musicians, however take the Grammys very seriously indeed. A big win can boost album sales and bump you up festival bills.",
      "That said, the awards themselves are notoriously ridiculous. According to legend, they were created in 1959 as a panicked reaction to the popularity of rock 'n' roll. Record companies hoped that by highlighting \"good\" music, they'd steer the public away from Elvis's swivelling hips.",
      "As if to illustrate that point, they didn't hand Mr Presley a trophy until 1968, and even that was for \"best sacred performance\", recognising his first gospel album, How Great Thou Art.",
      "Since then, the awards have remained wilfully arbitrary, woefully out of touch, or a combination of the two.",
      "Famously, The Beatles won more awards after they split up than they did together; and there were no rap categories until 1989.",
      "And if anyone still thinks that Herbie Hancock's jazz tribute to Joni Mitchell was the best album of 2008 - the year of Amy Winehouse's Back To Black and Kanye West's Graduation - I'd be interested to hear your arguments.",
      "So if Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't win on Sunday (or even if she does) don't let it affect your enjoyment of her music."

      "Actor Billy Crystal welcomed the crowd at the Kia forum, wearing clothes he had on when he escaped the Pacific Palisades fire earlier this month.",
      "\"You'll be hearing from a number of people who were tragically affected by these fires, and I was one of them,\" Crystal said as he opened the show.",
      "He had lived in the area for 46 years and spoke poignantly about losing his home.",
      "Crystal joked that he looked like someone who had just robbed a convenience store, adding that it was important to find moments of humour amid the devastation.",

      "California native Katy Perry waved the state's flag as she performed hits such as California Gurls.",
      "Other stars taking to the stage included No Doubt, from Orange County, and Dr Dre, who performed his anthem California Love, a collaboration with the late 2Pac.",

      "Eilish duetted with rock band Green Day for a performance of Last Night on Earth. The band's frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told the crowd: \"We're still alive, this is California, and we're all in this together.",

      "\"And I was pretty sure, as they whisked me away and evacuated me - my least favorite word now - to another safe place, that when I turned around and looked my house would be up in flames.\"",
      "But, the singer said her house \"stands strong, just like [me]. And in my opinion, she saved that whole street.\"",

      "Joni Mitchell, 81, made a rare public appearance, performing a rendition of Both Sides Now while sitting ona gold throne.",
      "\"Mitchell's observation that 'something's lost but something's gained in living every day' was met with a huge cheer. It felt like a dose of regal perspective from one of the all-time greats,\" said the Telegraph's James Hall in his review of the concert.",
      "\"The song was recorded in LA. And this is where this concert was most effective. The host of songs recorded in, or written about, LA reminded us about the place's musical pedigree and what could all too easily be lost.\"",
      "Red Hot Chilli Peppers performed their hit Under The Bridge, a paean to Los Angeles, with lyrics such as \"the city, she loves me\" taking on a new poignancy.",
      "The night concluded with a performance from Lady Gaga, who delivered a powerful performance of her hit Shallow from the 2018 film A Star Is Born.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris was one of the famous faces spotted in the crowd at the Intuit Dome.",
      "Her husband Doug Emhoff shared a picture taken inside the Intuit Dome on Instagram, with the caption: \"Kamala and I are grateful to be at the FireAid concert tonight in our hometown of Los Angeles.",

      "Prosecutors in New York have expanded their case against rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, accusing him of coercing two additional women into commercial sex acts, and of dangling a person over an apartment balcony.",
      "Combs has been in jail since September after an initial indictment charged him with racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "On Thursday, the indictment was updated to add two more victims, although no new charges were added to the case.",
      "The musician, 55, has strenuously denied all the accusations against him, including the federal criminal case and more than 30 separate civil lawsuits.",
      "In response to the superseding indictment, his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the prosecution's case \"remains flawed\".",
      "\"The government has added the ridiculous theory that two of Mr Combs's former girlfriends were not girlfriends at all, but were prostitutes. Mr Combs is as committed as ever to fighting these charges and winning at trial.\"",
      "The original indictment identified only one victim, named in court documents as \"Victim-1\", whose accusations aligned closely to those of Cassandra Ventura - the singer who sued Combs for rape and sex trafficking in 2023.",
      "In the new filing, prosecutors allege that Combs \"used force, threats of force, and coercion, to cause victims, including but not limited to three female victims\" to engage in commercial sex acts.",
      "That alleged violence was vividly illustrated in a video of the musician kicking, dragging and throwing a vase at Ms Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",

      "However, it was leaked to CNN last year. Combs later said he was \"disgusted\" by the footage and had sought \"professional help\" after the incident.",
      "Ms Ventura said the violence she had experienced \"broke me down to someone I never thought I'd become\".",
      "New claims added",

      "Amongst the new developments, prosecutors have moved the alleged start date of Combs' sex trafficking offences back to 2004, four years earlier than previously stated.",
      "They have also expanded the list of narcotics the musician allegedly used to keep his victims \"obedient and silent\" - adding methamphetamine and psychedelic mushrooms to the previously cited cocaine, oxycodone and ketamine.",
      "The accusation that Combs dangled a woman from a balcony mirrors a claim made in a civil lawsuit filed by fashion designer Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan last December.",
      "Prosecutors also added a claim that Combs had assaulted not just women but also \"his employees, witnesses to his abuse and others\".",

      "Singer and actress Marianne Faithfull has died at the age of 78, her spokesperson has said.",
      "Born in Hampstead in December 1946, she was known for hits like As Tears Go By, which reached the UK top 10 in 1964, and for starring roles in films including 1968's The Girl On A Motorcycle.",
      "She was also famously the girlfriend of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in the 1960s, inspiring songs such as Wild Horses and You Can't Always Get What You Want. After a period of heroin addiction in the 70s, she resurrected her career with the classic album Broken English.",
      "Paying tribute, Jagger described Faithfull as \"a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress,\" saying he was \"so saddened\".",
      "His bandmate Keith Richards posted that he was \"so sad\" following Faithfull's death, adding that he \"will miss her\".",

      "Obituary: 1960s icon and rock star muse who carved her own path",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood posted twice on Instagram. One an old picture of him, Faithfull and Richards in a recording studio with the caption \"Farewell dear Marianne\", and a more recent shot of the pair with the words \"Marianne will be dearly missed. Bless her xx\".",
      "\"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family,\" a statement from her spokesperson said.",
      "\"She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "The singer had previously suffered multiple health problems, including bulimia, breast cancer and emphysema caused by decades of smoking.",
      "In 2020, she contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalised for 22 days.",
      "Doctors said they did not expect her to survive - but she pulled through, releasing her 21st album, She Walks in Beauty, a year later.",
      "Her story is a remarkable portrait of the rock and roll era.",
      "She was a doe-eyed poster girl of the 1960s, plucked from obscurity by the Rolling Stones' manager at the age of 16 and given As Tears Go By, the first song ever written by Jagger and Keith Richards.",
      "An international hit, her version was light and breathy, delivered in a folk-pop style that was to become her trademark during the swinging 60s.",
      "With her eponymous debut album and 1966's North Country Maid, she became part of the \"British Invasion\" of the US pop charts.",
      "Meanwhile, her affair with Jagger turned her into a tabloid lightning rod. After they split she fell into drug addiction - at one point living homeless on the streets of Soho.",
      "She re-emerged tentatively with the 1976 album Dreamin' My Dreams but really hit her stride with 1979's New Wave-influenced Broken English, on which she showcased the ashen voice and hard-won wisdom that would define the second act of her career. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award.",
      "In recent years, she teamed up with songwriters like PJ Harvey and Nick Cave, who each cited her as an inspiration.",
      "Other collaborators over the years included David Bowie, Lou Reed, Jarvis Cocker, Damon Albarn, Emmylou Harris and Metallica, whose drummer Lars Ulrich thanked Faithfull for her \"incredible and unique contribution to our music, and for always being so willing to join us in performing it\".",
      "Her acting career ran in parallel to music. On stage, she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in Chekhov's Three Sisters; and played Ophelia in Hamlet \u2013 later admitting her nightly descent into madness had been chemically enhanced.",
      "She also played God in two episodes of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and the devil in William Burroughs' and Tom Waits' musical, The Black Rider.",
      "But music was where her heart lay. Her penultimate album, 2018's Negative Capabilty, was a meditation on ageing, loneliness and grief \u2013 inspired partly by the death of her old friend, and fellow Rolling Stones' paramour Anita Pallenberg; and partly by the terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub in her adopted home of Paris.",
      "Taking her full circle, the album included a raw and emotional re-recording of As Tears Go By that reduced everyone in the studio to tears, according to producer Rob Ellis.",
      "Faithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women's World Awards, and was made a commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France.",
      "Faithfull's long-time friend, the BBC Radio 2 presenter Bob Harris, called her an \"encapsulation of the sixties\".",
      "He said while she initially was known for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend, through her \"people began to see her as an artist, as a creator\".",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Harris added: \"To me, she was wonderful, she was interesting, very, very bright, and from an aristocratic background, which was always part of the way she carried herself.\"",
      "The singer married and divorced three times - to artist John Dunbar in 1965, Ben Brierly of punk band the Vibrators in 1979, and actor Giorgio Della Terza in 1988.",

      "For Christmas I received an interesting gift from a friend - my very own \"best-selling\" book.",
      "\"Tech-Splaining for Dummies\" (great title) bears my name and my photo on its cover, and it has glowing reviews.",
      "Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet.",
      "It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes.",
      "It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me.",
      "Several sentences begin \"as a leading technology journalist\u2026\" \u2013 cringe \u2013 which could have been scraped from an online bio.",
      "There's also a mysterious, repeated hallucination in the form of my cat (I have no pets). And there's a metaphor on almost every page \u2013 some more random than others.",

      "I'm not asking you to buy my book. Actually you can't \u2013 only Janet, who created it, can order any further copies.",
      "There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities \u2013 although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed \"solely to bring humour and joy\".",
      "Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a \"personalised gag gift\", and the books do not get sold further.",
      "He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI \u2013 selling AI-generated goods to human customers.",
      "It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me.",
      "Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it.",
      "\"We should be clear, when we are talking about data here, we actually mean human creators' life works,\" says Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights.",
      "\"This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records\u2026 The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that.\"",
      "In 2023 a song featuring AI-generated voices of Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it. It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:52:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Staff felt they could not speak up with concerns about the star's behaviour, an internal review finds.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".",
      "The apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.",
      "The investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.",
      "One of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".",
      "The BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.",
      "Brand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".",
      "'Stayed silent'",
      "Thursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".",
      "But the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.",
      "Many of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".",
      "While one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".",
      "Competition winner",
      "Commenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".",
      "\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.",
      "She added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".",
      "\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"",
      "The review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.",
      "Speaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".",
      "The report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".",
      "Channel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024. Its boss apologised to a former employee after the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.",
      "Brand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.",
      "In November 2024, the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Service a file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.",
      "'Not taken seriously'",
      "A BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.",
      "The report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".",
      "Douglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him was similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.",
      "The BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".",
      "\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.",
      "Another staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.",
      "Someone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.",
      "Staff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".",
      "'Inadequate' complaint handling",
      "Another complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.",
      "Brand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.",
      "The woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".",
      "The report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.",
      "In 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.",
      "\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.",
      "It concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.",
      "Another of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.",
      "The report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".",
      "The report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".",
      "The review cost \u00a3662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.",

      "Mr Ephron took the stand this week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",

      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",

      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna appear in court again?",
      "It's unclear if Rihanna will continue appearing for the trial. Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Media reports indicate that on Wednesday she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom. The couple's two children did not appear.",
      "Rihanna's presence sparked intense media and fan interest outside the courthouse, but she entered through a non-public entrance used by judges, and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence did attract attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

    "story": [
      "The Royal Ballet School (RBS) has reached a financial settlement with a former student, who said the body-shaming she experienced while at the elite institution has left her with lifelong psychological damage.",
      "Ellen Elphick, 31, had claimed the London-based school breached its duty of care when she attended between 2009 and 2012.",
      "The school said it accepted no liability for the former dancer's case and has not issued an apology.",
      "\"We are pleased that both parties were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement in this way and we wish Ellen and her family well for the future,\" said an RBS spokesperson - adding that the school \"continues to take the welfare of its students very seriously\".",
      "Last year, when Ellen spoke to the BBC she described how, as a 16-year-old, just two weeks into her training, a teacher publicly humiliated her by tracing a line around her body in front of a mirror.",
      "\"If I had a knife, this is what I would cut off,\" Ellen says the teacher said.",
      "The comment plunged Ellen into shame, she says, and exacerbated her struggles with disordered eating. She later received a diagnosis of atypical anorexia and body dysmorphia",
      "She said there was a pattern of similar comments from multiple teachers at the school, that further eroded her confidence and intensified her eating disorder.",

      "She said she had pursued legal action to bring attention to the harm caused by body-shaming in ballet. The financial terms of her settlement have not been publicly disclosed.",
      "\"It wasn't about the money,\" she said.",
      "\"It was about making people aware of what being a ballerina is really like and showing that what happened to me was unacceptable.\"",
      "Although she says she feels some validation from the settlement, Ellen expressed disappointment at the lack of an apology from RBS. \"That they couldn't even say 'sorry' shows there is so much more to do,\" she said.",
      "Now a mother, she said she wanted to shield her daughter from the ballet world and would \"never\" send her to ballet classes.",
      "However, she hopes her case could lead to meaningful reform and that ballet schools will prioritise students' mental health and train teachers to understand the impact of their words.",
      "\"RBS needs to lead the way and show that health and wellbeing matter more than just dancing,\" she said.",

      "The organisation works to make gaming more inclusive for people with disabilities - something companies have been focusing on more and more.",
      "This year its awards show handed out prizes to games released in 2024 for features including those aimed at helping deaf and blind players.",
      "Ubisoft was also recognised for two games it released last year.",
      "Star Wars Outlaws won the AAA Excellence award - for a big-budget title - for its long list of accessibility features.",
      "Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - a 2D platformer released last January - was recognised for its \"memory shards\" feature.",
      "The game requires players to navigate a large, complex map, often revisiting areas much later on in their playthrough.",
      "Many titles in the genre allow a user to place small pins - or icons - as reminders of points of interest, but The Lost Crown lets them take a screenshot to aid their memory.",
      "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 also won an award for its automatic movement features, and Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred won for its blind and low vision accessibility.",
      "GAConf also honours individuals in the games industry for their accessibility work.",
      "Cari Watterton, who works for Sniper Elite developer Rebellion, won the MVP Award for Unsung Hero.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat before her win, the senior accessibility designer said being recognised by others who work in her field \"hits a little bit differently\".",
      "\"They understand the amount of work that goes into accessibility and the challenges that you face,\" she said.",
      "Newsbeat previously spoke to Cari about her work on accessibility in 2023.",
      "At the time she said it had been a really great year in the space and more companies were looking to recruit specialists.",
      "She says the progress could have looked \"slower\" over the past 12 months, but games take time to make and developers are working on new things.",
      "\"The important thing is that we are seeing something new, in hardware, features, in games adopting their first accessibility features,\" says Cari.",
      "\"And we're seeing the quality of these features improve as well, which is fantastic.\"",
      "Cari's currently working on Atomfall - due for release in March - which took the rare step of announcing its accessibility features when the game was first revealed.",
      "'In a relatively stable place'",
      "GAConf co-director Ian Hamilton told BBC Newsbeat that \"whittling down the longlist into the finalists for each category was by far the hardest yet\" in the history of the ceremony.",
      "Ian, who's worked in the accessibility field since 2006, says the \"landscape is really unrecognisable compared to even just five years ago, let alone ten\".",
      "He said awareness of different players' needs and the number of specialist roles in the games industry had vastly increased, and a number of mainstream game awards now have an accessibility category.",
      "He said a dedicated ceremony allows the organisers to celebrate progress across the industry, giving awards in areas including advocacy, journalism and specialist resources.",
      "\"But there's still a long way to go,\" he said.",

      "The games industry's troubles in 2024, including studio closures and layoffs, have been widely reported.",
      "Dragon Age: The Veilguard maker Bioware - which won an award at GAConf for best representation - announced a studio restructuring just after the ceremony.",
      "It said some staff had been moved elsewhere, and though its post didn't mention job losses Newsbeat understands that about 20 people were laid off.",
      "And Ubisoft's accessibility wins come just days after it announced the closure of its Leamington Spa studio and staff reductions at other international offices, totalling 185 job losses.",
      "Late last year the company also said it had disbanded the team behind award winner The Lost Crown after reports suggested it did not hit sales targets.",
      "The publisher, which employs 18,500 people worldwide, has also delayed the upcoming game in its flagship Assassin's Creed series twice.",
      "But they are far from the only company affected.",
      "Cari says the impact has been felt across all areas of the industry, but she hopes developers will continue to push forward on accessibility.",
      "\"I don't think accessibility will be singled out,\" she says.",
      "\"I think it's going to be part of it. Something that we're all going to have to go through together.",
      "\"It's a shame, but I know that so much has been proven with reaching more people.\"",
      "GAConf co-director Ian said the current climate had affected accessibility efforts, with dedicated roles cut and the scale of job losses meaning wider expertise has been lost.",

    "story": [
      "By her own admission, Marianne Faithfull, who has died aged 78, \"didn't do conventional\".",
      "She was the convent-educated teenager who abandoned school after meeting the Rolling Stones.",
      "A delicate-featured picture of innocence, she inhaled the highs of chart success, before falling victim to alcohol and hard drugs.",
      "After splitting up with Mick Jagger, Faithfull spent years living as a heroin addict on the streets of Soho.",
      "Given the chance to restart her singing career, she went on to make more than 20 albums.",
      "Her whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.",
      "Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in Hampstead on 29 December 1946.",
      "Her mother was Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch, a Hungarian, half-Jewish former ballet dancer who had fled the Nazis in World War II.",
      "Her father was Major Glyn Faithfull, an eccentric British MI6 agent turned professor of Italian literature.",
      "The stage was set for an unusual childhood.",
      "Marianne spent her early years at Braziers Park, an upmarket commune founded by her father in an Oxfordshire country house.",
      "In her autobiography, she described it as a \"mixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex\".",
      "After divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.",
      "According to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".",
      "She had regular bouts of tuberculosis and was sent to St Joseph's Roman Catholic boarding school, despite her father's complaints that the nuns would \"give her a problem with sex for the rest of her life\".",
      "While still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.",
      "In 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.",
      "Famously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.",
      "Oldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.",
      "She would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.",
      "The Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".",
      "So Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.",
      "The song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".",
      "The melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.",
      "The Stones were so disappointed they had missed a hit, they recorded their own version a year later.",
      "Faithfull followed up with a series of singles, including Summer Nights, This Little Bird and - her highest chart success - Come and Stay with Me.",
      "She caught Bob Dylan's eye when he came to town.",
      "Inspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.",
      "In 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.",
      "He was not Faithfull's first Rolling Stone. \"I slept with three of them,\" she later admitted, \"and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.\"",
      "Her influence on the band was significant.",
      "Let's Spend the Night Together, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Wild Horses were all songs said to have been written about her.",
      "And Sympathy for the Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, a Russian novel Faithfull introduced to Jagger.",
      "As one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.",
      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",
      "Her character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.",
      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",
      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",
      "\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"",
      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",
      "The lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"",
      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",
      "At the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.",
      "A suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.",
      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",
      "\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"",
      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

      "The story is partially inspired by Fielding's own loss. Her husband, Kevin Curran, died in 2016.",

    "summary": "The Scottish rock band explain how music helped them through a tough period in their personal lives.",
    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "The battles their characters fight are not too dissimilar to what some of them have had to go through in real life.",
      "Josh Tedeku, who plays Jaheim, attended a private school growing up, so knows what it feels like to \"be in the minority\".",

      "The 22-year-old says the \"characters are really differentiated in the show and the beauty is that everyone can relate to a different character and see themselves in them\".",
      "Boarders gave the five leading actors their first major roles and they all tell the BBC they experienced imposter syndrome.",
      "\"It's funny because I am so different to my character,\" says Jodie Campbell, who plays Leah. \"I felt a lot of imposter syndrome at the start of series one because I was working with such talented people.\"",
      "Most of the actors were able to channel their feelings of imposter syndrome into their characters who are navigating how to fit into a school that wasn't built for them.",
      "But Campbell says she wasn't able to do that as her character \"doesn't feel any imposter syndrome\".",
      "\"Leah thinks it's the institution's fault for not welcoming her and she believes she has every right to be there.\"",
      "As the most outspoken of the scholarship students, Leah refuses to conform to the school's traditions and expectations. She finds herself regularly in trouble for challenging authority figures like the headmaster.",
      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",
      "\"I actually think racism is funny in that I laugh at how ridiculous it is that you can hate someone so much that you go out of your way to make fun of them or single them out all because of the colour of their skin.\"",
      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",
      "In the new series, the students are pitted against each other as the number of scholarships are to be whittled down from five to three.",
      "Tedeku says he knows what it feels like in real life to be set against his peers.",

      "His co-star Sekou Diaby who plays Toby, agrees and explains that the acting industry \"can be a toxic environment\".",

      "Diaby adds that it's even harder to break into the industry if you're from a working class background as \"there's a lot of nepotism in the industry\".",
      "\"But being different is also really powerful because your point of view is rarer in the industry so your take on things will be more unique and that's what will make you stand out.\"",

      "Lawyers acting for three people - including campaigner Keira Bell - have written to Streeting urging him to introduce a ban as he has done for puberty blockers for children questioning their gender identity.",

      "Keira Bell has previously taken legal action against the NHS - after her treatment when she was a teenager more than a decade ago at what was then the only NHS gender clinic.",
      "She was given puberty blockers at 16 and then the male hormone testosterone at 17 before having surgery to remove her breasts.",
      "Ms Bell, 28, told BBC News: \"I was very vulnerable and was dealing with a lot of issues.",

      "\"He banned puberty blockers, but failed to ban even more harmful cross-sex hormones that expose children to irreversible lifelong changes.",
      "\"This harmful trade continues unashamed and emboldened at the failure of the government to protect vulnerable children.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to the threat of a judicial review, but said it was working with regulators to tighten up rules around private provision of cross-sex hormones.",
      "A spokeswoman pointed out that the landmark Cass Review into gender care published last year did not call for a ban of cross-sex hormones for those aged 16 to 18.",
      "She added that \"additional safeguards\" were being put in place in the NHS with a group of health professionals now reviewing cases before cross-sex hormones are given to young people.",
      "The NHS can prescribe cross-sex hormones to under 18s.",
      "But the Cass Review found that there was a lack of research and \"weak evidence\" for medical interventions.",
      "As a result, NHS England wrote to all NHS gender clinics saying \"extreme caution\" should be exercised before recommending cross-sex hormones for under 18s.",
      "Changes are being made to the way NHS gender services for children are run with a move away from medical interventions and a greater focus on wider needs, including with mental health. Puberty blockers are no longer used by them at all - except in clinical trials.",

      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",

      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",

      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",

      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",

      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",

      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 21:13:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Tory leader Kemi Badenoch appears to distance herself from Priti Patel's comments on immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Priti Patel has put out a statement insisting she \"was not happy\" about the levels of immigration under the previous Conservative government, after earlier defending her party's record.",
      "In the earlier interview, Patel also declined to apologise for a rise in the numbers coming to the UK which took place when she was home secretary.",
      "Speaking to The Sun's Never Mind The Ballots, Patel, now shadow foreign secretary, said it was \"totally distortionary\" to suggest the government in which she served had thrown open the UK's borders.",
      "Her party leader Kemi Badenoch appeared to distance herself from the remarks, with her spokesman saying the Conservatives would \"tell the truth about the mistakes we made\".",
      "\"While the last Conservative government may have tried to control numbers, we did not deliver,\" he added.",
      "Last year, shortly after becoming leader, Badenoch held a press conference in which she said the rise in immigration had been \"a collective failure of political leaders from all parties over decades... but on behalf of the Conservative party, as the new leader, it is right that I accept responsibility and say truthfully, we got this wrong.\"",
      "Figures released in 2024 showed net migration to the UK hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before falling to 728,000 the following year.",
      "Immigration rose sharply under the points-based system for work visas, introduced after Brexit.",
      "Net migration hit record 906,000 last year",
      "Tories got immigration wrong, says Kemi Badenoch",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Challenged on the figures in an interview on Thursday, Patel - who was home secretary between 2019 and 2022 - sought to defend the Conservative's record on immigration.",
      "She said the points-based system had allowed the government to control the flow of immigration based on \"what our economy needs and what it doesn't need\".",
      "Asked if she should apologise to voters who were told Brexit would lead to a reduction in immigration, Patel said: \"I did not mislead them\".",
      "\"We made it quite clear it would be people from the rest of the world, people with skills\" coming into the UK post-Brexit, she added.",
      "She said many people came to the UK on health and social care visas, adding: \"Are we now saying we don't need those people in our NHS?\"",
      "However, she also said she was \"not fine\" with big rises in immigration and argued that the previous government should have done more to train people in the UK instead of relying on foreign labour to fill gaps in sectors such as farming.",
      "Asked why that had not happened, she said: \"That's a very good question that should have been posed to [environment ministers] and to others.",
      "\"I was doing other national security issues - the job of the home secretary.\"",
      "Responding to the interview, Labour labelled the Conservatives \"out of touch\" and said Patel \"seems proud of her central role in the Tory open-border experiment\".",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the Conservatives had a \"disastrous record on immigration - and would do it again\".",
      "A few hours after the interview was broadcast, Patel posted a message on social media in which she said: \"The immigration system in our country is not fit for purpose.",
      "\"As I said in the interview, I was not happy about the high numbers while the Conservatives were in government.",
      "\"Our party is now under new leadership and it is important we learn from our mistakes and how we can do things better.\""

    "summary": "Rachel Reeves has said she would now support any expansion, despite previously opposing the plans.",
    "story": [
      "The Chancellor has said she would now support the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA), saying \"the way we fly has changed\".",
      "As Leeds West MP, Reeves had opposed proposals for a new terminal at the Yorkshire site over environmental and noise concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, Reeves announced the government's backing of a third runway at London Heathrow and the re-opening of the Doncaster Sheffield airport, citing the progress of \"sustainable aviation\" since the pandemic.",
      "In 2022, LBA's \u00a3150m scheme to develop a new terminal was abandoned over planning delays, in favour of an earlier proposal to regenerate the current terminal.",
      "Speaking in Yorkshire following the government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor said \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand\".",
      "She defended her previous position of opposing the Leeds Bradford expansion, insisting \"a lot has changed since 2020 when those plans last came forward - no one was flying because it was during the pandemic, but also the way we fly has changed\".",
      "She added: \"Engines have become more efficient, and sustainable aviation fuel means we can reduce the carbon emissions from flying.",
      "\"Sustainable aviation fuel reduces carbon emissions by 70% and that mandate came in at the beginning of this year,\" she said, on Thursday.",
      "The Leeds West and Pudsey MP also highlighted the benefits the Heathrow expansion would have on the rest of the UK \"because the availability of slots at Heathrow is good for regional airports wanting to connect with the rest of the world\".",
      "Leeds Bradford Airport first put forward plans for a new terminal five years ago, as part of its bid to increase passenger numbers at the airport to seven million by 2030.",
      "A planning application was approved by the council in February 2021, despite objections by campaigners and local MPs - including Reeves, then the member for Leeds West.",
      "\"It is clear that an increase in both flights and passenger numbers would undermine vital efforts to ensure Leeds upholds its commitments to be carbon neutral by 2030,\" she said, at the time.",
      "The expansion proposals were eventually withdrawn in 2022, with airport bosses citing \"excessive delays\" prompted by local concern over increased aircraft movements - particularly at night - and the decision to refer the scheme to the Secretary of State for a public inquiry.",
      "Airport bosses instead turned their attention to extending the existing terminal, plans for which were approved by Leeds City Council in 2019.",
      "Work began on the project in 2023 and includes the construction of a 102,000 sq ft (9,500 sq m), three-storey extension.",
      "The Chief Executive of LBA, Vincent Hodder, has welcomed the government's decision to back expansion at Heathrow. He believes it is \"positive for the UK in general\" and aviation more widely.",
      "\"The Chancellor's announcement yesterday, and her comments today, voices positive support for the aviation industry as a whole,\" said Mr Hodder.",
      "\"We've now got a government who understands the role of aviation as an economic accelerator, and are willing to stand behind it and support sustainable growth.",
      "\"Here at LBA, we're looking forward to working in collaboration with our government, our airline partners and our community to ensure we're delivering the world-class facilities Yorkshire deserves.\"",
      "However, campaigners protesting the development of Leeds Bradford Airport have contested the chancellor's claims over the link between aviation and economic growth.",
      "Ian Coatman, secretary for GALBA - a group of campaigners based in West Yorkshire who are against the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport - said: \"Claims made about airport expansion being good for the economy are overstated.",
      "\"Flights for business purposes fell by nearly a third between 2019 and 2023, with 3.9 million fewer business trips made - and yet the economy grew by 1.8% over the same period.\"",
      "He said any government investment would be better spent on renewable energy.",
      "\"I know the government is investing in renewable energy - like wind farms - and that is good news. Surely it's better to do more of that than cause more climate pollution by letting airports expand?",
      "\"It's a lot quicker to create good jobs in renewable energy than by building a new runway.\""

      "There is some better news for pub-goers, as a small cut in duty on draught pints will also come into effect.",
      "The 1.7% tax drop on the production of draught alcohol, which was announced in last year's Budget, is the first such cut in a decade.",
      "The relief applies to draught drinks below 8.5% ABV, which equates to a 1p tax cut on an average-strength pint.",
      "Businesses 'squeezed'",
      "From Saturday, the alcohol tax will rise by 3.6%, in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.",
      "There will also be further increases in duty for some drinks, depending on their strength.",
      "A new system of duties based on strength was introduced in August 2023, although some wines were given a temporary reprieve. This relief is now ending.",

      "But she claimed any prospect of growth would be \"destroyed\" by the government's Employment Rights Bill, which she said would place more burdens on business.",
      "In her speech in Oxford, Reeves sought to inject some optimism and confidence into the economy, which has taken a battering in recent months as growth has flatlined.",
      "She hit back at Conservative claims that her \"job destroying\" Budget was to blame, insisting she had \"no alternative\" but to increase employers' National Insurance to restore stability.",
      "She did not explicitly rule out further tax increases in the spring - but insisted the government had \"begun to turn things round\" and was determined to go \"further and faster\" to boost growth.",
      "She described the UK as a country of \"huge potential\" which had been \"held back\" for \"too long\" because politicians lacked the \"courage\" to challenge the status quo.",
      "\"Low growth is not our destiny, but growth will not come without a fight, without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country's future for the better,\" she added.",
      "The government has made growth its top priority because so many of its other plans - to improve public services and living standards, as well as its chances of winning the next election - depend on it.",
      "Ministers insist advances in aviation mean a third runway would not break its carbon reduction rules - but it is still being fiercely resisted by environmental campaigners and Labour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan.",
      "In an interview with the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves said she wants a planning application for a third runway at Heathrow \"signed off\" before the next election, which must happen by 2029.",
      "She said she wanted to \"get going sooner than that\" on the next phase of an East-West rail project that will eventually connect Oxford directly to Cambridge, via Milton Keynes and Bedford.",
      "\"I want spades in the ground. I want people to see in their areas, things happening, growth happening, their children and their grandchildren in the future having the opportunity to work in high-skilled high-paid jobs contributing to the economy with more money in their pockets,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Earlier she claimed the new Oxford and Cambridge \"growth corridor\", which includes new reservoirs to address water shortages in the area and investment in high tech industries, would add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "Other projects announced today include a major redevelopment of Old Trafford, the area around a new stadium for Manchester United, and a plan to bring Doncaster/Sheffield airport back into use and boost industry at East Midlands airport.",
      "Trade unions welcomed the Heathrow announcement and the airport's chief executive Thomas Woldbye described the chancellor's speech as \"the bold, responsible vision the UK needs to thrive in the 21st century\".",
      "But Sir Sadiq Khan said: \"I'm simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment.\"",
      "Reeves she has been \"genuinely shocked\" at how slow the planning system is - adding developers should be able to stop worrying about \"the bats and the newts\".",
      "She claims new powers in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill would cut years off the lengthy periods it has taken to get major infrastructure projects off the ground.",
      "And Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to get rid of a \"thicket of red tape\" that he claimed was deterring foreign investment, in an article for The Times.",
      "The government is also relaxing restrictions on big pension funds to encourage them to invest more in UK businesses.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "Will electric planes and sustainable fuel make Heathrow's third runway green?",
      "The government will also review the so-called Green Book rules - guidance issued by the Treasury on how to appraise policies, programmes and projects - which it said have in the past biased infrastructure spending to already fast growing areas, mainly in the south.",
      "At prime minister's questions, Kemi Badenoch took aim at the government's Employment Rights Bill, which aims to strengthen workers' rights.",
      "The Conservative leader claimed it would \"hammer\" businesses and destroy growth, and urged the PM to scrap the parts that will extend entitlement to statutory sick pay.",
      "She said extra sick pay will increase business costs by between \u00a3600m to \u00a31bn, according to the government's own estimates.",
      "\"That will mean higher prices, fewer jobs, less growth,\" she told Sir Keir.",
      "The prime minister insisted the new laws would be \"good for workers and good for growth\" and accused the Tories of being \"a coalition of blockers\".",
      "Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called on Sir Keir to drop his objections to a UK-EU customs union and other \"growth damaging trade barriers\" on an upcoming trip to Brussels.",
      "The SNP's economy spokesman Dave Doogan said the chancellor's speech \"offered nothing for Scotland\", adding: \"Instead of fixing broken Brexit Britain, Rachel Reeves has taken the UK economy in the wrong direction.\""

    "story": [
      "There are no plans to expand the definition of extremism, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis has said, following reports it could be broadened to cover potentially violent environmentalists and misogynists.",
      "He said Islamist extremism followed by far right extremism were the biggest threats  but added that the Southport attack did show a need for \"action on those drawn towards mixed ideologies and violence-obsessed young people\".",
      "It comes after parts of a Home Office-ordered report were leaked to the right-leaning Policy Exchange think tank, which criticised proposals to look at behaviour over ideology.",
      "Jarvis said the report was \"not current or new policy\".",
      "Asked about the report earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said the government was \"looking carefully\" at how to approach the issue.",
      "\"It's very important that we are focused on the threats so we can deploy our resources properly and therefore we're looking carefully where the key challenges are.\"",
      "The prime minister said there was the \"additional challenge\" in the aftermath of the Southport attack of \"a cohort of loners who are extreme and they need to be factored in\".",
      "Don't expand terrorist label, says former anti-terror chief",
      "'Terrorism has changed', says PM on Southport attacks",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper commissioned Home Office officials to conduct a rapid review of the UK's approach upon entering office and the work was sped up in the wake of the murder of three young girls in Southport and the subsequent riots across the UK.",
      "The review was tasked with shaping a new counter-extremism strategy, addressing online and offline threats from Islamist and the far-right alongside a broader spectrum of extremism.",
      "The government's current definition of extremism is the promotion of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance that aims to destroy the rights and freedoms of others or undermine liberal parliamentary democracy.",
      "Leaked sections of the report, published by Policy Exchange, recommend the government's counter-extremism strategy shift focus to \"behaviours of concern\" rather than \"ideologies\".",
      "Behaviours of concern include violence against women, spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories, fascination with gore or involvement in the online subculture called the \"manosphere\" - which promotes misogyny and opposition to feminism.",

      "Privately, government sources have strongly criticised the report and said certain elements of it were shocking, despite it having been conducted by the Home Office's own officials.",
      "However, the government will need to work out a way to deal with violent individuals and ideologies.",
      "In response to the sentencing of Southport killer Axel Rudakubana last week, the prime minister said terrorism \"has changed\" in Britain and a review would be carried out into \"our entire counter-extremist system\".",
      "While in the past he said \"the predominant threat was highly organised groups with clear political intent\", alongside that there were now also \"acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom\".",
      "Rudakubana was referred to the Prevent anti-terrorism programme three times but the referrals were closed due to his apparent lack of a clear ideology.",
      "Some people responded to the leaked report by arguing that the activity it identified was already covered by the government's definition of extremism.",
      "Lord Walney, the government's independent adviser on political violence, said what the report had in effect proposed was not a call to widen the definition but to \"deprioritise\" the \"vital focus on Islamist and far-right ideological drivers\".",
      "Others are questioning the implications of the home secretary publicly disowning the work of her officials.",
      "One senior source said the situation was now \"a mess\" and criticised Cooper for asking internal officials to conduct the review in the first place, rather than commissioning external experts.",
      "Government sources insisted they still had confidence in the work of their officials on extremism, despite rejecting their report.",

      "Separate from the report, the government has commissioned a public inquiry, not only to look at what went wrong in how public bodies like the police, Prevent and the NHS handled Rudakubana, but also to look at the wider problems of youth violence and extremism.",
      "In the meantime, the Home Office is conducting a review of how Prevent interacts with other agencies like the NHS and the police when somebody is not seen as suitable for Prevent, but clearly has neurodivergence or mental health difficulties and poses a risk of violent behaviour.",
      "On Sunday the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote in The Times that there is \"a serious problem when cases don't pass the Prevent threshold but still need urgent action and instead just go into a void\".",
      "The government seems to be moving towards a plan that leaves the existing terrorism and extremism structures largely intact, but bolsters how public bodies handle people who have no clear ideology but pose a risk of serious violence due to obsessions with things such as school massacres.",
      "A pilot scheme will launch next month.",
      "Danny Shaw, a former adviser to Cooper, told the BBC's Today programme he had seen a summary of the report and backed one of the recommendations which said \"the counter-extremism function should take an approach based on behaviours that cause harm rather than one based on definition\".",
      "\"That approach was not taken in the case of Axel Rudakubana because he didn't fit a definition that meant he could have intervention by Prevent so he was transferred away and passed from one agency to another,\" he added.",
      "Appearing on the same programme, Nick Aldworth, a former detective chief superintendent in counter terrorism, expressed concern about police resources, adding: \"If you have a definition or legislation that can't easily be policed it is probably not worth doing.\"",
      "The Policy Exchange authors, who released the Home Office findings, said the review \"runs in the wrong direction\".",

      "\"Such threats come overwhelmingly from those with an ideological or political motive, principally Islamism but also far-right and other forms of extremism.\"",
      "The report's recommendations \"risk swamping already stretched\" security services, while redefining extremism \"threatens free speech,\" the authors said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",

      "One senior government source insisted this morning that Reeves's decision to publicly invite Heathrow to submit an application should be seen as just that - an invitation that will kick off a long process with plenty more opportunities for internal opponents to make their case.",
      "Some inside Labour argue that there is a generational divide within the party on many controversial growth issues, including this one.",
      "One member of the 2024 Labour intake told me this afternoon that they expected opposition to Heathrow expansion among Labour MPs to be limited mostly to \"nimby boomers\".",
      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",
      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",
      "One Labour adviser said: \"We need to do what we did today, but that's not about winning the next election. For that we need to give the voters we need to keep what they want and need.\""

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 01:04:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The breeds show different reaction to clocks going back and forward, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",
      "The researchers say their \"takeaway finding\" is that, for working dogs, gradually easing into a timetable change might be beneficial.",
      "Because, while you can teach an old dog a new routine, such an abrupt, overnight shift can be unsettling. Unless, of course, you Are a pet with no work demands and a particularly comfortable dog bed."

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "None of these stories are going to challenge Harry Potter or Roald Dahl any time soon, but it is a start for more refined ideas to flourish perhaps.",
      "DeepSeek, on the other hand, responded with just one idea - \"Luna and the Boy Who Chased the Stars\". Its response was 387 words (with no mention of anyone or thing called \"Luna\"), and comprised a story about a curious boy called Milo who lived on the moon.",

      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",

      "US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe.",
      "DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.",
      "AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise.",
      "In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.",
      "What is DeepSeek and why did it cause tech stocks to drop?",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.",
      "Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (\u00a3400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.",
      "President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" that would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",
      "After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of \"performance on par with\" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning.",
      "Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.",
      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.",
      "In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%.",
      "Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%.",
      "In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth.",
      "\"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.",
      "\"So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\"",
      "Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\".",
      "But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.",
      "\"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" analysts said in a report.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.",
      "\"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.\"",
      "Who founded DeepSeek?",
      "The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.",
      "The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.",
      "He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China.",
      "Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.",
      "Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.",
      "In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.",
      "\"We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,\" he said.",
      "\"We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:18:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision.",
    "story": [
      "On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: \"Just setting up my twttr\". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.",
      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",
      "\"We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.\"",
      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",

      "A battle looms",
      "For Western markets that are increasingly wary of Beijing's ambitions, trade has become a powerful bargaining chip - especially as a sluggish Chinese economy relies ever more on exports. Trump returned on a campaign promise that included crushing tariffs against Chinese-made goods, and has since threatened a 10% levy that is expected to take effect on 1 February.",
      "He has also ordered a review of US-China trade - which buys Beijing time and Washington, negotiating room. And for now, harsher rhetoric (and higher tariffs) seems to be directed against US allies such as Canada and Mexico.",
      "Trump may have pressed pause on the looming battle with Beijing. But many believe it's still coming. It's hard to find an exact figure on how many businesses are fleeing China, but major firms such as Nike, Adidas and Puma have already relocated to Vietnam. Chinese businesses too have been moving, reshaping supply chains, although Beijing remains a key player.",
      "Mr Peng says his boss, who owns the factory, has considered moving production to South East Asia, along with many of their competitors.",

      "Mr Peng, whose wife died when their son was young, says the factory has been his family: \"Our boss is determined not to abandon these employees.\"",
      "He is aware of the geopolitics at play, but he says he and his workers are just trying to make a living. They are still reeling from the impact of 2019, when a fourth round of Trump tariffs - 15% - hit Chinese-made consumer goods, such as clothes and shoes.",

      "That status slipped under Trump. But it was not restored under his successor Joe Biden, who kept most Trump-era tariffs in place, as ties with Beijing frayed.",
      "In fact, the European Union too has imposed tariffs on electric vehicle imports, accusing China of making too much, often with the support of state subsidies. Trump has echoed this - that China's \"unfair\" trade practices disadvantage foreign comeptitors.",
      "Beijing sees such rhetoric as Western attempts to stifle its growth, and it has repeatedly warned Washington that there will be no winners in a trade war. But it has also said it's ready to talk and \"properly handle differences\".",
      "And President Trump, who has described tariffs as his \"one big power\" over China, certainly wants to talk.",
      "It's unclear as yet what he might want in return. During Trump's honeymoon period with China in his first term he came to Beijing to ask for Xi's help in meeting North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. This time it is believed he might need Xi's support to make a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. He recently said that China had \"a great deal of power over that situation\".",
      "The threat of a 10% tariff is driven by the belief that China is \"sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada\". So he could demand that it do more to end that flow.",
      "Or, given he welcomed a bidding war over TikTok, he may want to negotiate its ownership - or the prized technology that powers the app - because Beijing would need to agree to any such sale.",
      "Whatever the deal may be, it could help reset US-China ties. However, the absence of one could abruptly end the chance of a second honeymoon, setting up Trump and Xi for a far more confrontational relationship.",

      "An hour outside Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, businessman Huang Zhaodong has built a new factory to cater to a flood of orders from US giants Walmart and Costco.",
      "This is his second factory in Cambodia, and together they produce half a million garments a month, from shirts to underwear. Hangers carrying cotton trousers roll past us on an automated line, moving from one station to the next as the elastic waist is inserted and hemlines are finished.",
      "Now, when prospective US customers lob the first question, which he has come to expect -  where is he based - Mr Huang has the right answer. Not in China.",
      "\"In the case of some Chinese firms, their customers have told them: 'If you don't move production overseas, I'll cancel your orders'.\"",
      "The tariffs raise tough choices for suppliers and retailers, but it's not always clear who will bear the brunt of the cost. Sometimes it will be the customer, Mr Huang says.",
      "\"Take Walmart as an example. I sell them clothes at $5, but they usually mark it up 3.5 times. If the cost increases due to higher tariffs, the price I sell to them might rise to $6. If they mark it up by 3.5 times, the retail price would increase.\"",
      "But usually, he says, it is the supplier. If his production line was in China, he estimates an extra 10% tariff could take an extra $800,000 (\u00a3644,000) from his earnings.",
      "\"That's more than what I make as profit. It's huge and we can't afford it. If you're making clothes in China under such tariff conditions, it's unsustainable,\" he says.",
      "Current US tariffs on Chinese goods vary from 100% on electric vehicles to 25% on steel and aluminium. Until now, several top-selling items have been exempt, including electronics, such as TVs and iPhones.",
      "But the 10% blanket tariff Trump is proposing could affect the price of everything that is made in China and exported to the US. That applies to a lot of things - from toys and tea cups to laptops.",
      "Mr Huang says this would encourage more factories to move elsewhere. Several new workshops have sprung up around him and Chinese companies from textile production heartlands such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong are moving in to make winter jackets and woollen clothing.",
      "Around 90% of clothing factories in Cambodia are now Chinese-run or Chinese-owned, according to a report by insight and analysis group Research and Markets.",
      "Half of the country's foreign investment flows from China. Seventy percent of roads and bridges were built using loans Beijing dispensed, according to Chinese state media.",
      "Many of the signs on restaurants and shops are in Chinese as well as Khmer, the local language. There's even a ring road named Xi Jinping Boulevard in honour of the Chinese president.",
      "Cambodia is not a lone recipient. China has invested heavily in different parts of the world under President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative - a trade and infrastructure project that also increases Beijing's influence.",
      "That means China has choices.",
      "Chinese state media claims that more than half of China's imports and exports now come from Belt and Road countries, most of them in South East Asia.",
      "This has not happened overnight, says Kenny Yao from AlixPartners, who advises Chinese firms on how to deal with tariffs.",
      "During Trump's first term, many Chinese firms doubted his tariff threat, he told the BBC. Now they ask if he will follow the supply chain and slap tariffs on other countries.",
      "Just in case he does, Mr Yao says, it would be wise for Chinese businesses to look further afield: \"For example, Africa or Latin America. This is more difficult, but it is good to look at areas you have not explored before.\"",
      "As America pledges to look after itself first, Beijing is doing its best to appear a stable business partner, and there is some evidence it is working.",
      "China has edged past the US to become the prevailing choice for countries in South East Asia, according to a survey by the Iseas Yusof-Ishak think tank in Singapore.",
      "Even though production has moved abroad, money still flows to China - 60% of the materials being made into clothes at Mr Huang's factories in Phnom Penh come from China.",
      "And exports are thriving, with Beijing investing more heavily in high-end manufacturing, from solar panels to artificial intelligence. Last year's trade surplus with the world - on the back of a nearly 6% year-on-year jump in exports - was a record $992bn.",
      "Still,  Chinese businesses - in Jiangsu and Phnom Penh - are preparing themselves for an uncertain spell, if not a turbulent one.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 23:48:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The Famine Early Warning System Network is used to predict and prevent famines around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The United States' system for monitoring famine globally has been taken offline amid President Donald Trump's order for a 90-day freeze on nearly all US foreign assistance.",
      "The Famine Early Warning System Network (Fewsnet) was established after the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, as part of a worldwide effort to prevent a repeat of its devastating impact.",
      "It was designed by US government agencies, including its international development body USAID and the space agency Nasa.",
      "It is regarded as a gold standard in combining weather data and political analysis to predict drought and food insecurity globally.",
      "Alongside a model run by the UN, the system allows aid officials to target emergency food supply ahead of time, and is credited with mitigating the effects of a devastating drought in the Horn of Africa in 2016.",
      "It has been used to try to target aid during the current famine in Sudan as the war continues there.",
      "A briefing service provided by the network was stopped as part of Trump's suspension of nearly all foreign assistance, according to a source familiar with Fewsnet's operations.",
      "Asked about the shutdown, USAID said it was \"expeditiously processing exception requests\" but could not \"address every individual exception-related question\". It was not clear whether an exception request for Fewsnet was pending.",
      "The network is \"insanely important\", according to Dave Harden, who oversaw its operation at USAID during the 2016 food security emergency in East Africa.",
      "\"Because we had Fewsnet, and we had guard teams, we were able to pre-position food and supplies [in Ethiopia] and plant it in a way that was remarkably different than what happened in 1984,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Last Friday, the State Department issued a \"stop-work\" order on all US foreign assistance, worth nearly $70bn a year, with the exception of emergency food aid and military aid to Israel and Egypt, pending a 90-day review to ensure programmes' alignment with Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy.",
      "Since then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expanded the scope of projects eligible for waivers to the order, including for life-saving medicine and shelter, but there remains widespread confusion in the global aid sector, significant parts of which have been upended by the freeze.",
      "Fewsnet is operated by a USAID contractor, which declined to comment, while its website is run by another provider which did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Explaining the thinking behind the breadth of stop-work orders, Mr Rubio said on Thursday that \"things that save lives\" were being exempted, adding that others could apply for waivers to ensure their projects were not an inefficient use of US taxpayer money and were aligned with Trump's priorities.",
      "Proponents of the foreign aid freeze see US donations as bloated and carrying too much of the burden compared with other wealthy Western countries.",

      "What is a famine?",
      "The Trump administration has also vowed to end foreign aid funding for diversity and inclusion programmes, transgender rights, family planning, abortions and other issues long targeted by many Republicans.",
      "The exemption for emergency food aid does not appear so far to have included the famine-tracking operation.",
      "Jeremy Konyndyk, a former senior official at USAID, described the system as \"the single best resource\" in the world for food insecurity prediction, adding that in 2011 it saw the famine coming in Somalia months ahead of time.",
      "\"The client was the US government\u2026 but everything was put online. And that was really important - it became a global public good, [because] any donor in the world can use that, any government in the world can use that,\" he said.",
      "\"It's a really critical resource\u2026 sounding the alarm when there is a major food crisis emerging.\"",
      "A USAID spokesperson said: \"We are expeditiously processing exception requests. Several urgent requests have been approved within hours. We cannot address every individual exception-related question but commit to transparency consistent with the President's Executive Order.",
      "\"The Secretary of State has approved core life-saving humanitarian assistance and issued waivers for specific purposes. Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work.\""

    "story": [
      "The Grammys are music's biggest night, both literally and figuratively.",
      "The ceremony, which takes place in LA on Sunday night, runs for a staggering eight hours, attracting the biggest stars in pop, rock, country and hip-hop.",
      "Organisers will hand out 94 awards, recognising everything from best pop album to best choral performance.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift have both confirmed their attendance, as they square off in the album of the year category for the first time since 2010 (Swift won on that occasion, fact fans).",
      "There'll also be performances from Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone, Shakira, Stevie Wonder, Teddy Swims and Raye - and an in memoriam tribute to Thriller producer Quincy Jones.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the ceremony.",
      "1) Who's going to win album of the year?",
      "The big question of the night is whether Beyonc\u00e9 will finally win album of the year, after four previous losses in the category?",
      "During last year's ceremony, her husband Jay-Z addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's latest record, Cowboy Carter, is a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. It's the sort of thing that delights Grammy voters, who traditionally prefer albums that elevate America's musical history over contemporary, cutting-edge productions.",
      "But the album's excessive length - including a few weaker tracks in its latter half - could count against it.",
      "Billie Eilish is currently the bookmakers' favourite with her third album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Mixing passionate power ballads with violent electronic shifts and hip-hop swagger, it marks a new evolution in the star's songwriting partnership with her brother, Finneas.",
      "Charli XCX's Brat is a career-defining pop record that became a cultural phenomenon. The best-reviewed album of 2024, it's probably too abrasive for the Grammys' more conservative voters, but that's their loss.",
      "And you'd have to be crazy to ignore Taylor Swift. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, was the biggest-seller of last year; a fact that will undoubtedly be taken into account, even if the record is one of her weaker efforts.",
      "If she wins, Swift will collect her fifth album of the year trophy - more than any other artist in Grammy history.",
      "2) What about the other big prizes?",
      "One of the year's most stacked categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".",
      "Aside from a rogue nomination for The Beatles (see below), the shortlist reflects a stellar year for pop music, with Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and Charli XCX's 360 up against Beyonc\u00e9's Texas Hold 'Em and Billie Eilish's Birds Of A Feather.",
      "But the front-runner is Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. A furious take-down of his rap nemesis, Drake, it's as catchy as it is legally contentious. If it wins, it would be only the second hip-hop single to win the category, following Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019.",
      "In the parallel song of the year prize - which recognises achievement in songwriting - the smart money is on Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With A Smile.",
      "Both artists are perennial Grammy favourites, and their virtuoso ballad will be catnip to voters.",
      "Their competition includes Shaboozey's A Bar Song (Tipsy), which was America's longest-running number one single of 2024. However, the fact that it's based on a previous hit (J-Kwon's Tipsy) is likely to count against it.",
      "Chappell Roan's breakout single Good Luck Babe is another strong contender, notable for its soaring high notes and a piercing lyric that skewers internalised homophobia. Billie Eilish's gossamer ballad Birds of a Feather is a similar masterclass in songcraft - making this category one of the hardest to predict.",
      "By contrast, the coveted best new artist prize is pretty much a two-way split between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, both of whom established a dominant chart presence in 2024 after years on the pop sidelines.",
      "That's bad news for the sole British nominee, six-time Brit Award winner Raye. But at least she's in good company, alongside breakout rap star Doechii and big-hearted pop singer Teddy Swims.",

      "3) Which Grammy records could be broken?",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter has 11 nominations, potentially making it the most-rewarded album in Grammy history.",
      "The record is currently held by Santana, who got nine trophies for his album Supernatural in 2000 (coincidentally, the same year that Beyonc\u00e9 received her first Grammy nomination, as part of Destiny's Child).",
      "And if Cowboy Carter doesn't take home best album, Beyonc\u00e9 still breaks a record, for the most nominations in that category without a win.",
      "Billie Eilish could become the first female artist to win Record of the Year three times with Birds of a Feather. Paul Simon and Bruno Mars are the only other artist with three wins in the category.",
      "Rapper turned flautist Andr\u00e9 3000 is also poised to make history. If he wins best instrumental composition, he does so with the longest song title in Grammy history: I Swear, I Really Wanted To Make A 'Rap' Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time.",
      "The current record holders, in case you were wondering, are Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips. In 2007, they won best rock instrumental performance for the magnificently-titled The Wizard Turns on the Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins.",
      "4) Who votes for the Grammys?",
      "More than 13,000 members of the Recording Academy vote for the Grammys every year - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write CD liner notes.",
      "To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (\u00a3120). All former winners are also eligible to vote.",
      "Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.",
      "Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.",
      "The 2025 awards recognise music released between 16 September 2023 and 30 August, 2024. The winners are not revealed until the ceremony.",
      "5) How did The Beatles get nominated?",
      "The Beatles might have broken up 55 years ago, but they're up for two prizes on Sunday: record of the year and best rock performance.",
      "Both nominations recognise Now and Then, a song that John Lennon demoed in the 1970s, and which was finally completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr last year.",
      "Grammy voters, with their eyes firmly trained on the past, rarely miss an opportunity to reward the Beatles. Eight years ago, for example, the band's documentary Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years beat Beyonc\u00e9's groundbreaking Lemonade for best music film.",
      "In some ways, that's correcting an historic wrong. In their prime, the Beatles were nominated for record of the year four times - for I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be - but lost every time.",
      "A win in 2025 would prove that Beatlemania never fades - but voters may be put off by The Beatles' use of machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence), which was used to clean up Lennon's scratchy old cassette recordings.",
      "The Recording Academy's rules on AI say that \"only human creators\" can win Grammys, and that \"the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful\".",
      "That's true in the case of Now And Then, but many creators remain sceptical of the technology.",
      "6) How will the California wildfires affect the ceremony?",

      "As if to illustrate that point, they didn't hand Mr Presley a trophy until 1968, and even that was for \"best sacred performance\", recognising his first gospel album, How Great Thou Art.",
      "Since then, the awards have remained wilfully arbitrary, woefully out of touch, or a combination of the two.",
      "Famously, The Beatles won more awards after they split up than they did together; and there were no rap categories until 1989.",

      "Hundreds of adoptions could have taken place between the 1950s and 1990s, say former members.",
      "Some of the children who were adopted within the church have told us they were then subjected to abuse and neglect in their adoptive families.",
      "The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. The FBI has since launched an investigation.",
      "Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "Four women - who were all unmarried at the time - have told us they were given no option but to give up their babies. Three of them feared being cast out of the church and sent to hell if they refused.",
      "One says she was pressured into giving her baby to a married couple in the church after she was raped in 1988, age 17.",
      "\"My fear of going to hell was so great that it forced me to make up my mind to give up the baby to this couple in the church,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Another says she wasn't allowed to see her baby daughter before the child was taken away forever.",
      "The BBC has also spoken to six people given up for adoption as babies between the 1960s and 1980s. One woman says she was physically and emotionally abused in her first adoptive family in the church, and sexually abused in the second.",
      "The adopted children - born all over the US - are referred to within the church as \"Baldwin Babies\" because the adoptions were overseen by Wally Baldwin, a doctor from the sect who died in 2004.",
      "Some of the women would stay at his home in Oregon during pregnancy, according to a minister who used to work with Dr Baldwin.",
      "The exact number of Baldwin Babies is unclear. The BBC has spoken to the late doctor's adopted son, Gary Baldwin, who said the original records were no longer available but he believed the number to be \"less than 200\".",
      "He said that \"inevitably\" mistakes were made by his father's vetting system but that his intentions were good. Others we spoke to also said they remembered Dr Baldwin fondly.",
      "Because The Truth has no official leader, the BBC instead contacted six of its most senior current officials - known as \"overseers\" - for comment. We received one response. The overseer told us any adoptions he was aware of had been done \"through legal channels\" and he had \"heard some beautiful stories\".",
      "One woman who was adopted recalled seeing hundreds of photos in an album Dr Baldwin would keep of the children whose adoptions he had organised in The Truth.",

      "\"Somewhere the church got off track and it became a fear-based cult and I was forced to make a choice,\" says Melanie Williams, 62, who gave up her baby for adoption in January 1981.",
      "At 18, Melanie became pregnant after falling \"madly in love\" with a boy from her school.",
      "Not only were the pair unmarried, but the father was not a member of The Truth and refused to become one. This meant Melanie had committed a \"terrible sin\" in the eyes of local workers.",
      "The workers and her family decided that she could only continue to attend church meetings if she gave her baby to another family in the sect.",
      "\"If I keep this baby, I'm going to go to hell. If I keep the baby, I can't go home,\" Melanie recalls thinking.",
      "She gave birth in a Catholic hospital in Oklahoma, where she was discreetly put in a room on her own.",

      "When she eventually found out the baby was alive, she told a nurse she was wavering on whether to go through with the adoption and wanted to hold her baby.",
      "\"You can't ever hold your baby,\" came the reply.",
      "Years later, Melanie managed to track her daughter down - but she didn't want to meet.",
      "Deb Adadjo, 54, was also unsure about giving up her baby, but felt too much pressure at the time to refuse the workers, who threatened to ban her from church meetings - which in The Truth meant you not only got thrown out of the church, but also ended up in hell.",
      "She became pregnant after being raped in 1988.",
      "Recalling holding her newborn, she says - \"I can still feel her against my chest right now.\"",

      "\"I would journal a lot too - wondering where she was, what she was like, what she might be going through at the age she was.\"",
      "Then in 2004, Sherlene's daughter got in touch by email and they met. They are close to this day.",
      "\"When we finally met, we just hugged and hugged and hugged,\" says Sherlene.",
      "\"We talk for like two or three hours on the phone - she's a pretty incredible woman.\"",
      "Adopted babies left open to abuse",

      "One woman said she was removed from her first adoptive home by social services because of extreme physical abuse and was placed in the home of a church \"elder\" - a person of seniority who holds meetings in their own home - and his wife.

    "story": [
      "There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.",
      "It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.",
      "The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.",
      "The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal \u2013 including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.",
      "It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more \u2013 of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.",
      "The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan \u2013 the ore from which tantalum is extracted \u2013 is mined.",
      "Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.",
      "Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.",
      "Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.",
      "They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.",
      "Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a \"state-like administration\", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (\u00a320) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.",
      "It runs the area as a monopoly making sure \u2013 through the threat of arrest and detention \u2013 that only its authorised traders are able to do business.",
      "The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.",
      "There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.",
      "Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.",
      "Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the Innovative Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.",
      "The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \u2013 so-called \"conflict minerals\" \u2013 are not inadvertently funding violence.",
      "But Itsci has come under some criticism.",
      "Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.",
      "Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.",
      "He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.",
      "\"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.\"",
      "Itsci did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but has in the past defended its record saying that the scheme has been subjected to a rigorous independent audit. It has also been praised for bringing \"prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners\".",

      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.",
      "Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.",
      "The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to \"heavy-duty trucks\" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.",
      "Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a \"significant contamination of supply chains\".",
      "The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.",
      "\"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.",
      "In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.",
      "\"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,\" she added.",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\".",
      "Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.",
      "In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using \"conflict minerals\".",
      "Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.",

      "Even at a club that has produced countless elite-level skaters - where the competition is as tough as it gets - the two stood out.",
      "\"They had been sought out and identified as the future of the sport,\" the club's CEO Doug Zeghibe told me while standing alongside the rink where the two athletes trained day in and day out.",
      "\"So, to see such promising talents snuffed out, it's hard. They really, truly were on the cusp of greatness and really, finally hitting their goals of representing not just the Skating Club of Boston but representing their country.\"",
      "That talent, on full display in videos that show them both performing with a strength and maturity beyond their ages,  was why they were invited to the High Performance Camp that followed the US National Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, this week.",
      "After the camp, they boarded an American Airlines regional jet on Wednesday evening, planning to fly home to Massachusetts via Washington DC.  They were among the 60 passengers killed when the jet had a mid-air collision with a helicopter and fell into the Potomac River.",
      "Their mothers, Christine Lane and Jin Han, and the club's star coaches Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, were also on board, meaning that six of the crash victims were all connected to the world-renowned skating club.",
      "Skating at such a high level demands a huge commitment, with schoolwork being carried out online after hours on the ice each day.",
      "Inevitably, close relationships develop among coaches and club members alike and, in the face of such a disaster, the clubhouse is a natural place to gather.",
      "Just a few days ago, club members Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov won the US pairs title in Wichita before taking an earlier flight home.",
      "\"They were just two sunshines that you get the energy from as soon as you see them,\" Efimova told me.",

      "\"Spencer was a firecracker, that's the best way to put it,\" Mitrofanov added.",
      "\"He started skating fairly later than other skaters, but because of his amazing talent, he progressed so quickly.\"",
      "At the end of a hard day's training, they told me, the two would take their skates off and head upstairs to begin catching up on academic work.",
      "Now, in the club's entrance, photographs capturing them in motion on the ice are surrounded by tributes and flowers. Jinna has her arms outstretched.  Spencer maintains a look of deep focus on his face.",
      "\"You don't expect it,\" Mitrofanov said. \"And when it happens, it breaks you.\"",

      "CEO Zeghibe immediately thought of that crash as he watched the unfolding news on Wednesday night.",

      "\"You got these really narrow pathways in and out and you've got a lot of congestion and extra airplanes, so you're putting a lot of aircraft in a really confined space,\" he said.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former aircraft accident investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the NTSB, told BBC Newshour that it seems the helicopter was in communication with the control tower before the accident. The air traffic controller pointed out the American Airlines flight to the helicopter, he said.",

      "At the time, the South Africa's military had just emerged from being regarded as a \"highly effective apartheid war-time force\" to a \"peacetime force\" left to grapple with reduced funding and a \"lack of political direction\", Thomas Mandrup, an associate professor at the country's Stellenbosch University, told the BBC.",
      "While South Africa has said its involvement in DR Congo was guided by its need to \"contribute to the stability\" of a fellow Sadc member, defence analyst Dean Wingrin said the country's economic interests also influenced its decision.",
      "\"The DRC is a very big trading partner with [us] because eastern DRC is so rich in minerals. We import a lot of minerals\u2026 from the DRC so South Africa has an interest in a peaceful DRC,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While Monusco's mission has largely been about peacekeeping, escalating tensions in the region led to the establishment of the Force Intervention Brigade in 2013 to \"actively engage\" with the numerous armed groups in eastern DR Congo.",
      "This intervention had initial success in repelling the M23, the most prominent rebel group.",
      "This was partly due to the deployment of South Africa's attack aircraft - Rooivalk - which had a \"devastating effect\" on the M23 in a short space of time, according to Mr Wingrin.",
      "The rebel group then effectively melted away and was subsequently expelled from eastern DR Congo - until its recent comeback which has seen it capture much of the region.",

      "He added that it was difficult for South Africa to bring back its troops at this point because the \"forces are locked down and caught in two bases\".",
      "\"They can't get out, get aircover [or] reinforcements. They can't even get the wounded out,\" he said.",
      "Ramaphosa seemed to agree, saying in a recent statement that the situation in the region was \"tense, volatile and unpredictable\".",
      "In spite of this, any decision to pull South African troops out of DR Congo ultimately lies with Sadc since SAMIDRC was deployed by the 16-member regional bloc.",

      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",

    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",
      "Asked whether he ever worries about running out of ideas, he said, \"No, I think I worry about running out of time to get all of my ideas down on paper!\"",

    "title": "The spirit of Sundance",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "summary": "A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in a state with one of the strictest abortion bans.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took offline recommendations on how doctors should treat sexually transmitted infections and vaccinate adults Friday, as part of a sweeping purge of all mentions of \"gender\" from federal websites ordered by the Trump administration this week.",

Harvey, head of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that agency staff had been racing Friday to meet a 5 p.m. deadline set by the Office of Personnel Management, to implement President Trump's executive order that the federal government now only recognizes \"two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "Web pages that could not be immediately reworded to strip out all mentions of gender, like those aimed at transgender people, were taken down to be reworked.",
      "\"People will get sick. And, especially in cases like congenital syphilis where you cannot lose a day to treat, babies will die,\" said Harvey.",
      "Some changes were minor and kept web pages online, like rewording information about Zika virus from saying \"pregnant person\" to \"pregnant woman\" instead.",
      "Others have resulted in gutting key parts of the agency's website. Data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a nationwide survey of high school students about mental health, substance abuse and violence, were also wiped from the website.",
      "The last round of the survey's results had highlighted worsening mental health and violence affecting LGBTQ high school students.",
      "Also pulled offline was much of the CDC's adult immunization guidance, which referenced transgender and nonbinary people as part of carefully crafted recommendations for some vaccines passed by a panel of the agency's outside advisers.",
      "Other health agencies were also affected by the rewrites.",
      "Data published by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion tracking progress to meet federal goals like reducing the bullying of transgender students and curbing the proportion of gay high school students using illegal drugs were deleted.",
      "Announcements and guidance by the Food and Drug Administration mentioning gender were either rewritten to swap for references to sex or scrubbed, like a now-deleted 2023 move by the agency that had been intended to make it easier for gay and bisexual men to donate blood.",
      "Nonprofits, hospitals and health departments ordered to comply",
      "Letters obtained by CBS News sent to nonprofits and state and local health departments receiving federal health dollars also left some grant recipients confused.",
      "One letter suggested that all their staff and communications would also be forced to comply with the Trump administration's sweeping new rules banning gender from all their activities, like dropping the mention of pronouns from email signatures and removing gender from their websites as a condition of continuing to receive federal funds.",
      "Another targeted mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that similar to federal rules, they also were now required to \"immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting\" those ideas \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contracts\" supported by the funds.",
      "Some hospitals also said this week they are moving to suspend medications and procedures for youth seeking gender-affirming care, following an executive order signed on Tuesday by President Trump to curb procedures and prescriptions for gender transitions in minors.",
      "\"Children's National is committed to providing compassionate and comprehensive care in accordance with the law. As a result, we are currently pausing all puberty blockers and hormone therapy prescriptions for transgender youth patients,\" Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. said in a statement Thursday.",
      "The hospital already did not perform gender transition surgery for minors, a spokesperson said. They did not comment on how many patients would be impacted by the pause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",

You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",

      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",

      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",

      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",

      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze.

      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities.

Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care.

      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",

    "title": "How are H5N9 and H5N1 different? What to know after California bird flu outbreak",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cousin urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a blistering letter to senators on Tuesday \u2014 a day before his confirmation hearings \u2014 that described him as a \"predator\" whose actions \"have cost lives.\"",
      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",
      "Her cousin, she said, is \"addicted to attention and power.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pick is set to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Finance, which will decide whether to advance his nomination. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces opposition from both sides of the aisle. Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states. Democrats and vaccine experts have condemned him for spreading misleading claims on a range of vaccines, including the COVID-19 and polio shots.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 18:09:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House said it will levy new import duties on its three closest trading partners starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados if the Trump administration proceeds with its plan to slap\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners starting Feb. 1.",
      "President Trump will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting this weekend, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",

      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:28:42 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is set on Feb. 1 to unleash a wave of new import duties\u00a0on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "On Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump on Saturday will imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. She cited \"illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country\" as the reason for the tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump is proposing in putting a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also chose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "If fully enacted, Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support to that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:13:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump is poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he is primed to deliver.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a Jan. 31 press briefing.",
      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",

      "The Star-Ledger's president, Wes Turner, pointed to an op-ed on NJ.com that stated the closure was forced by \"rising costs, decreasing circulation and reduced demand for print.\"",

      "The company announced on Jan. 24 that it would end its DEI goals that were previously set to increase Black employees' representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers' experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",
      "\"For decades, Target has benefitted from nearly unfettered support from Minnesota residents, families and consumers all around the country. In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",
      "\"We do not believe it is a coincidence that Target made this decision after the holiday shopping season and roughly one week before the start of Black History Month,\" said Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota.",
      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",
      "The fact Target actually increased DEI efforts after George Floyd's murder is making the company's decision that much more unbelievable for people like Jaylani Hussein, spokesperson for CAIR-MN.",
      "\"If you would have told me in those summers and months to come here today, talking about Target reversing its decision, I would personally say I couldn't believe it,\" said Hussein.",
      "He speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February. On the other side of the boycott, Black business owners like Tabitha Brown \u2014 who sells kitchenware and has had her products highlighted in Target stores under the company's previous DEI initiatives \u2014 said in an Instagram video that she understands the anger. However, she asked for those who may consider a boycott to reconsider.",
      "\"If we all decide to boycott and be like, 'No, we're not spending no money at these organizations,' so many of us will be affected and our sales would drop our business would be hurt,\" said Brown.",
      "\"We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\" Target said in its initial statement explaining the rollback. \"Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\"",
      "The decision raised questions about the future of Target's philanthropic commitments. A company spokesperson told the Associated Press that the \"recent update does not impact Target Foundation giving,\" but added that, \"as always, the foundation will continue to evaluate how it best supports organizations, coalitions and networks.\"",
      "Shortly after Target's announcement,\u00a0Twin Cities Pride, a longtime partner, said the company would not be welcome at this year's Pride celebration and renounced $50,000 in funding. Less than 24 hours later, Twin Cities Pride said community donations had filled the gap.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:55:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",
      "Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry.",

They would continue to receive paychecks during regular pay periods, rather than a lump sum payout, OPM officials told CBS News.",

Another 46% were eligible to telework, and they spent an average of 61% of working hours in office. Only 10% of federal workers were in fully remote positions.",

      "\"The substantial majority of federal employees\" working remotely since the pandemic \"will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\" the email says, adding that there were plans for \"meaningful consolidation\" that could result in office relocations for \"a number of federal workers.\"",
      "The message to government workers also said that while some agencies and parts of the military were likely to be expanded, \"the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force.\" As a result, a number of federal employees could be subject to furloughs and reclassification as at-will workers.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",

With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",

      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed held its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, a move that was forecast by a majority of economists polled by FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed had signaled that it expected fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",

      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "The National Association of Medicaid Directors is seeking clarification on the interruption from the White House, according to a spokesperson.",
      "By Wednesday, multiple state Medicaid programs had reported that they were able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",

Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",

      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "title": "What has DEI actually done for U.S. workers and employers?",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks.",
      "Starbucks baristas will also ask customers if they would like to order \"for here\" or \"to go\". Customers who order drinks \"for here\" will receive their order in a ceramic coffee mug or glass, or in a clean personal cup brought from home.",
      "\"Offering customers who sit and stay their beverages in ceramic mugs and glassware is one way we're returning our cafes to warm welcoming coffeehouses,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"It's also another way that Starbucks is reducing waste and making each visit a more sustainable choice.\"",
      "More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups. Though the caf\u00e9s offer recycling bins, a recent CBS News investigation found that many of those cups don't actually end up getting recycled. It's a problem that goes far beyond Starbucks \u2014 few recycling facilities around the country accept this type of single-use plastic for processing.",
      "Starbucks says it aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030, and it rolled out redesigned cups last year made with up to 20% less plastic.",
      "Customers who order any drinks \"for here,\" in a reusable cup or mug, will also be eligible for free refills of hot or iced brewed coffee or tea during that visit to a participating Starbucks location in the U.S. and Canada.

      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol last year shared his vision of Starbucks becoming \"a welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee.\"",
      "Under his leadership, Starbucks also recently reversed its open-door policy, requiring people to make a purchase if they want to hang out at its coffee shops or use the restrooms.

      "Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The GOP letter came after Costco shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the wholesale club operator evaluate any risks associated to its DEI practices.

      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",

      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians.

      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",

      "Less than 10% of the nation's airport terminal towers have enough air traffic controllers to meet a set of standards set by a working group that included the Federal Aviation Administration and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "The issue has received renewed scrutiny following Wednesday night's midair collision between an American Airlines flight and a Black Hawk Army helicopter near Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "Only one air traffic control worker was managing the helicopters and some planes from the Reagan National Airport tower at the time of the collision, a job normally done by two people, two sources told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Only about 2% of the towers met the Collaborative Resource Working Group's 2024 staffing targets for the number of fully-trained air traffic controllers. Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.",
      "Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude \"en route\" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.",
      "The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.",
      "Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds \"in training\" are counted.",
      "In the report, the FAA cites the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it has struggled to meet staff expansion goals at air traffic control facilities across the country.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.\"",
      "The agency also noted that \"on-the-job training of developmental air traffic controllers was significantly reduced,\" as well as hiring targets. The agency said that had a significant impact on its efforts to develop fully-trained controllers.",
      "The staffing targets in the report are goals based on an analysis by a group that included FAA's Air Traffic Organization as well as the controllers' labor union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.",
      "The FAA also included in the report its own internal staffing standards for each facility. Using that standard, which is lower for many facilities than the working group's targets, 45% of the airport towers met the standard, counting only fully-trained controllers. If all controllers in training are included, 59% of the airports met the lower FAA standard.",
      "\"If we hired 2,000 people today, in two, three years from now, we'd see only about 1,000 of them become a certified air traffic controller,\" National Air Traffic Controllers Association president Nick Daniels told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Marie Owens-Powell, president of the union that represents more than 8,500 employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, did not mince words during a Friday call about morale among its members: \"It's bad. I've been with the agency for over 33 years and I've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "Starting Wednesday morning, more than 1,100 employees at the EPA received an email, which has been viewed by CBS News, warning they could be immediately fired because of their probationary status as an employee with less than a year in their current role.",
      "\"As a probationary/trial period employee, the agency has the right to immediately terminate you pursuant to 5 CFR \u00a7 315.804,\" read the email, which was sent to employees by Kimberly Patrick, principal deputy assistant administrator for mission support of the EPA.",
      "According to Owens-Powell, employees with a range of experience received the emails \u2014 some with less than a year at the EPA, as well as tenured employees who recently moved into new positions inside the agency.",
      "\"As far as we can tell, EPA workers were the only ones to receive a notice from their agency, intended to go to probationary employees to terrorize and scare them into thinking they were on their way out,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reached out to the EPA and the White House about the email, as well as to confirm how many government employees received it, and is awaiting a response.",
      "Owens-Powell says she was on a national call with other union leaders who represent workers at various government agencies, and no one else said their probationary employees received such an email.",
      "\"Every day, folks are afraid to turn their computers on,\" said Owens-Powell, \"They don't know what message will be coming out next.\"",
      "In addition to the concerns over their jobs, there is also stress and confusion over the Office of Management and Budget's\u00a0 temporary pause on government funds.",
      "\"Hundreds of EPA grantees are completely locked out of the grant system,\" says Michelle Roos, president of the Environmental Protection Network, a nonprofit formed in 2017 by hundreds of former EPA employees who work to maintain the integrity of the agency. \"They are unable to process payroll, they are unable to pay invoices, they're unable to do the critical work that they were granted to do.\"",
      "Even though the OMB memorandum was rescinded, agency employees still lack clarity and are being told not to communicate with grant recipients until new guidance is issued, says Roos.",
      "\"Most folks are terrified to speak to grantees beyond, 'I'm so sorry, I can't talk to you,'\" she said.",
      "There is a growing concern among grant recipients that if they are unable to receive certain approvals for required plans and goals, they will fall out of compliance and lose funding.",
      "\"These actions are unconstitutional and are unauthorized by law,\" said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice for Lawyers For Good Government, a nonprofit of thousands of pro-bono lawyers across the country that is working with the unions to help protect government employees and their jobs.",
      "\"Ninety-five percent of the funding going to EPA has not only been appropriated, but is locked in, legally obligated grant funding. The Constitution does not give the president a line item veto over Congress's spending decisions,\" said Blanchard.",
      "While the mood inside the EPA appears grim, Owens-Powell and Blanchard both say they have seen a surge of new membership and participation in their organizations, as EPA workers contend with the flurry of executive orders and emails that have left many on edge about their futures.",
      "On a\u00a0Reddit page dedicated to discussing the buyout offer for federal workers, one poster wrote, \"I was looking for any way to get out of this fresh hell. But now I am fired up to make these goons as frustrated as possible.\" Another wrote, \"I'll continue to do my job and fight for the position I've earned. It took me 10 years of applying and 20 years experience in my field to get here.\"",
      "\"It's backfired and people are furious,\" says Owens-Powell. More than 4,000 employees tried to access town hall meetings the union organized this week to address their concerns, she says. \"We're just trying to help them channel that energy.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department initiated the personnel changes at the D.C. U.S. attorney's office and the FBI.",
    "story": [
      "Justice Department leadership has directed Washington, D.C.'s top prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, to fire prosecutors who were assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a memo dated Jan. 31, reviewed by CBS News and also confirmed by sources familiar with the matter. And in a separate memo, the deputy attorney general on Friday also ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection undergo review.",
      "Martin's directive, written by Acting Attorney General James McHenry, said the firings would be effective immediately. The memo included an appendix with names of the employees who would be fired.",
      "Some operating under the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., had been hired as term employees to carry out the sprawling Jan. 6 probe. Before the presidential transition, the Biden Justice Department made them permanent employees.",
      "According to the memo, their employment has \"hindered the ability\" of the D.C. U.S. attorney to \"faithfully implement the agenda that the American people elected President Trump to execute.\"",
      "\"The appropriate step is to terminate these employees, and to take all appropriate steps to ensure that resources allocated to their hiring and employment\" are available to current Justice Department leadership, the memo said.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Furthermore, the acting deputy attorney general, Mr. Trump's former defense attorney Emil Bove, has ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The FBI's acting director, Brian Driscoll, sent a letter to all FBI employees in which he detailed the directive, which also included an order to fire eight current FBI executives. As CBS News previously reported, many Executive Assistant Directors, including those who headed up the critical national security, cyber and criminal divisions, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination.",
      "According to a copy of Driscoll's letter also reviewed by CBS News, the Acting Director said of the Jan. 6-related agent lists, \"We understand this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigations. I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director Kissane.\"",
      "Bove's memo ordered the eight executives to be terminated by Feb. 3 and the list of employees who work on the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 be compiled by Feb. 4. The head of the Washington, D.C. Field Office is also expected to be removed from his post by Feb. 10, according to the sources.",
      "Driscoll \u2014 who assumed the top job after former FBI Director Christopher Wray resigned \u2014 told the bureau's employees, \"We are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what's in the best interest of the workforce and the American people.\"",
      "Bove's memo said he was directing the firings and other personnel review to take on allegations of weaponization within the Justice Department.",
      "\"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully,\" Bove wrote of the FBI executives.",
      "Bove's memo also said agents who worked on a case in which the Justice Department charged senior leaders of Hamas with terrorism, murder conspiracy and sanctions-evasion should also be reviewed.",
      "The moves would expand an ongoing purge of employees within the Justice Department and the FBI, where top officials have been told to retire, resign or be fired by Monday. Government officials are reviewing lists of FBI agents who worked on the probes to determine who should be fired and the numbers of agents affected could grow, two of the sources said.",
      "The senior FBI officials receiving notice to resign or be fired include those at the executive assistant director level at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and numerous heads of FBI field offices across the country. The special agents in charge of Miami and Las Vegas offices, as well as the assistant director in charge of the Washington field offices have also received notice, three people familiar with the moves told CBS News. These agents are expected to accept retirement.",
      "The top officials at the executive assistant director level being instructed to retire manage the FBI's criminal, national security and cyber investigations. There may be more changes throughout the FBI, too, sources said.",
      "Some were notified while Kash Patel, President Trump's pick to lead the FBI, faced questions by senators at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. The panel has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "While the number of agents affected by the latest changes remains unclear, the decision to include those who worked on the complex probe into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot could reverberate across the country, since agents from a number of FBI field offices participated in what became the largest investigation in Justice Department history. More than 1,500 defendants were charged in nearly every state, and FBI personnel played critical roles in each case. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The investigation into the Capitol breach has been closed, but multiple people familiar with the matter previously told CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, initiated a review previous charging decisions behind hundreds of cases. That review is ongoing.",
      "FBI agents also worked with federal prosecutors as they investigated and later charged Mr. Trump in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, one tied to the president's handling of classified records and the other related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election. Those agents are expected to be removed from their positions. The charges against Mr. Trump were dropped before his inauguration and the special counsel resigned.",
      "The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment when contacted by CBS News. However, Patel was asked during his confirmation hearing specifically about the firing of FBI agents who worked on the Trump cases.",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" Patel said. He later added that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "In a statement, the FBI Agents Association, which represents active and former FBI personnel, said, \"If true, these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents. Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.",
      "\"These actions also contradict the commitments that Attorney General-nominee Pam Bondi and Director-nominee Kash Patel made during their nomination hearings before the United States Senate,\" the association continued. \"They also run counter to the commitment that Director-nominee Patel made to the FBI Agents Association, where during our meeting he said that Agents would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned.\"",
      "Last week, CBS News reported that more than a dozen federal prosecutors who worked on Smith's team to charge Mr. Trump were fired by the Justice Department.",
      "The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions by a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda, according to two sources.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News at the time.",
      "In all, the moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Earlier this month, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he has applied to the special counsel's prosecutions.",

    "story": [
      "In a Thursday press briefing, President Trump criticized his predecessor for his management of the Federal Aviation Administration and suggested, without evidence, that diversity initiatives at the agency could be to blame for a deadly crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.\" Mr. Trump added that people in those categories would be \"qualified\" for controller positions, even though the agency's statement does not say that.",
      "The president continued, \"Brilliant people have to be in those positions.\"",
      "It has been longstanding FAA policy \u2014 including before, during and after Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 to include people with disabilities in recruitment. However, there is no evidence that these initiatives have compromised air safety or had any relation to the crash Wednesday night. The cause of the collision remains under investigation.",
      "Air traffic controllers must undergo extensive training and meet rigorous standards, including physical and mental fitness tests. They cannot have a history of mental disorders or physical conditions that could interfere with their duties, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which is the chief human resources agency for the federal government.",
      "People with disabilities have to meet the same rigorous standards as other applicants, according to Chai Feldblum, a former commissioner of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during both the Obama and first Trump administrations.",

      "\"The thing [President Trump] got wrong legally was that somehow this would be just a Democratic administration that had suddenly out of the blue decided to try to find and hire people with disabilities. That's simply not grounded in reality,\" Feldblum said.",
      "When asked by a reporter how he could come to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"Because I have common sense.\"",
      "The head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which is the controllers' union, said in a letter to its members that at this time it would be \"premature to speculate on the root cause of this accident.\"",
      "Federal investigators have also said it is too early to determine the cause or what factors may have contributed to the crash. It was the first major commercial airline crash in the United States since 2009.",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked why the \"Diversity and Inclusion\" policy was not changed on the FAA's website throughout his first administration. He said, \"I did change it. I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy. And then Biden came in and he changed it.\" It's unclear precisely what policy he was referring to.",

      "Those whose parole classification is revoked, and who lack another immigration status, would become ineligible to work in the U.S. lawfully. They would also receive notices to appear in immigration court, the first step in the deportation process, according to the internal documents.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration empowered federal immigration agents, including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to seek the deportation \u2014 including in an expedited fashion in some cases \u2014 of those permitted to enter the U.S. under various Biden administration policies, including the CHNV program.",
      "Some of those who have arrived to the U.S. under the CHNV process have access to programs that would protect them from deportation.",
      "Many Haitians and Venezuelans, for example, are enrolled in the TPS program, which, like parole, temporarily shields them from deportation and gives them work permits. But TPS is in the crosshairs of Trump officials, who argue the policy has also been abused.",
      "Just this week, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era extension of the TPS designation for Venezuelans, paving the way for some migrants from Venezuela to lose that status sooner.",
      "Cubans with parole status have unique access to a process to become legal permanent residents due to a Cold War-era law. All nationalities can also apply for asylum, but that requires applicants to prove they are fleeing persecution based on certain factors, like their politics or religion \u2014 a high legal threshold.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Tom Jawetz, a former DHS immigration official under the Biden administration, denounced the Trump administration's plan.",
      "\"Targeting people who came to the U.S. with sponsors and continue to play by the rules isn't just gratuitously cruel, but it will make our system more chaotic,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, who seized on Biden's unpopular immigration policies during the presidential campaign, has staged a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal and legal immigration.",
      "Through a presidential decree, officials have effectively closed down the American asylum system; given ICE officers a broad mandate to target most unauthorized immigrants, including non-criminals; and assigned the Pentagon to help with border enforcement, including through the use of military planes to deport migrants entering the U.S. illegally.",
      "The Trump administration has also taken steps to restrict legal immigration, pausing arrivals of refugees, or people fleeing persecution overseas who are allowed to come to the U.S. lawfully after security and medical checks.",
      "A key component of Mr. Trump's moves have centered on dismantling the Biden administration's immigration legacy. Beyond the CHNV program, the Trump administration has shut down other Biden-era initiatives, including a phone app that allowed migrants in Mexico to schedule a time to enter the U.S. at official border entry points to start their asylum cases.",
      "Trump officials have also suspended processes that allowed the U.S. to welcome Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Afghans escaping Taliban rule and Central American children hoping to reunite with relatives in the U.S.",
      "Like the CHNV program, these policies rely on the immigration parole authority. The Trump administration has ordered officials to review those policies and determine whether they should be permanently terminated.",

    "summary": "A memo from the Office of Management and Budget ordering a freeze on federal assistance sparked confusion across the country earlier this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance\u00a0after a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenged a memo from the White House budget office ordering a pause of federal funding.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island on Friday\u00a0granted the request for a temporary restraining order sought by the Democrat-led states, which had argued that the actions from the Office of Management and Budget violated federal law and the Constitution.",
      "McConnell's order was expected, as he had signaled following a hearing Wednesday that he was inclined to issue the temporary pause of the Trump administration's directive. The judge said in his decision that the Office of Management and Budget's actions are likely unconstitutional and violate federal law.",
      "\"Are there some aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate constitutionally for the Executive to take? The court imagines there are, but it is equally sure that there are many instances in the Executive Orders' wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous 'pause' of critical funding that are not,\" McConnell found.",
      "The judge wrote that the budget office did not cite any legal authority that allowed it to unilaterally suspend the flow of federal funds to states and other entities and said \"no federal law would authorize the executive's unilateral action here.\"",
      "\"The states have set forth facts showing that the executive's abrupt 'pause' in potentially trillions of dollars of federal funding will cause a ripple effect that would directly impact the states and other's ability to provide and administer vital services and relief to their citizens,\" McConnell wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the lawsuit, cheered the court's order and said the president cannot unilaterally stop congressional spending commitments.",
      "\"This administration's reckless plan to block federal funding has already caused chaos, confusion, and conflict throughout our country,\" she said in a statement. \"In the short time since this policy was announced, families have been cut off from childcare services, essential Medicaid funds were disrupted, and critical law enforcement efforts were put in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Democrat-led states filed their lawsuit earlier this week in response to a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that ordered agencies to temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo was issued by Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who said the freeze was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Its full scope was not clear and sparked confusion and chaos around the country as states and nonprofits scrambled to determine whether they would be affected. Lawmakers, too, fielded calls from constituents and organizations in their states seeking answers about whether they would be cut off from federal dollars.",
      "The memo also prompted immediate legal action from the Democrat-led states and a group of nonprofit organizations, who filed a separate challenge in Washington, D.C. A federal judge there swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofits to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",

To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The president's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"",

      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",

      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 09:09:56 -0500",
    "summary": "DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, whose chairmanship is coming to an end, said in an interview with CBS News he hopes Democrats come to \"understand that you've got to be more elastic than rigid.\"",
    "story": [
      "As his time as chairman of Democratic National Committee comes to a close after a difficult election cycle, Jaime Harrison hopes people in his party come to \"understand that you've got to be more elastic than rigid.\"",
      "Harrison, who was picked by then-President Joe Biden to take over the role in 2021, said \"Sometimes, we got folks that are very rigid. If you don't have the right job, if you didn't come from the right community, if you don't say the right word, and then therefore you are x-ed out or you're castigated.\"",
      "\"We need to pause on that. Let's be a big tent, and let's be an open tent and embrace more diversity, in terms of thought,\" Harrison said.",
      "Harrison's comments come as party leaders prepare to pick his successor Saturday during a meeting in Maryland.",
      "In a conversation ahead of the election to replace him, Harrison strongly defended Biden and stood by the lightning-fast process that saw then-Vice President Kamala Harris receive the support of DNC delegates and become the party's new nominee after Biden ended his reelection bid last summer.",
      "Conscious that some in the party might consider a snap White House bid, Harrison said he had checked in with some of the \"people who had expressed some interest down the road for running,\" including governors.",
      "\"Every single one of them said, 'I'm not going to run. I'm supporting Kamala Harris.' And it was almost like I was chasing the Kamala Harris calls, because they all said, 'I just talked to the VP, and I have pledged my support to her,'\" he said.",
      "Besides, Harrison believes party rules made any discussion of a short primary in the run-up to the Chicago convention impossible.",
      "\"So you're saying ... after the primaries were done, then we should restart another primary process,\" Harrison said. \"How do you do that? Who's going to pay for those primaries? Is the DNC supposed to pay for those primaries? Because, you know, primaries cost money, right?\"",
      "When asked about Harris, the party's 2024 nominee, Harrison said the former vice president should run again for the White House if she wants to.",
      "\"If I didn't believe Kamala Harris could win, I wouldn't have worked as hard as I did to help her win this last time around,\" he said. \"When you look at politics, Donald Trump and Barack Obama are just enigmas in politics. I think they do something different to the electorate every time they run that you can't counter, but then when they are not on the ballot, it's almost like you go back to \u2014 the political gravity pulls people right back into it. That's part of\u2026how well we did in the [2022] midterms.\"",
      "The party's struggles in 2024, when enough voters sided with President Donald Trump and his far different vision for the country than the one espoused by Democrats, has created major questions about the path forward for the party.",
      "\"I know in a 176-year history, people have written the epitaph of the Democratic Party a lot of times, and people are trying to write it again. But don't sleep on this Democratic Party. What we have to do is to build on the infrastructure that we have built,\" Harrison said.",
      "And while Democrats' soul searching continues, Republicans in Washington have been taking a victory lap in the early days of Trump's return to power.",
      "\"We have seen the greatest political comeback in American history play out before our eyes. We needed to win four out of seven swing states. President Trump won all seven,\" Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley said earlier this month at a party event. \"We needed to keep the popular vote close. President Trump won it by millions of votes. We needed to drive turnout with low propensity voters and engage with communities that Democrats have taken for granted for decades. We shattered every record, and we got our people to the polls.\"",
      "Harrison led the DNC through a turbulent time in American politics. The party that holds the White House typically struggles in the midterms, but the move by the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the federal right to an abortion became a catalyzing issue for Democrats in 2022. That year, Democrats were able to add to their narrow Senate majority while narrowly losing the House, despite GOP hopes for a major \"red wave.\"",
      "The 2024 election cycle was filled with far starker challenges for Democrats. The party was defending Senate seats in the Republican-dominated states of Montana and Ohio while incumbents in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada were also on the ballot. Concerns about Biden's age had been building, though the overhauled slate of early primary states ushered in by Harrison and Biden, starting with Harrison's home state of South Carolina holding the first national party sanctioned Democratic primary, helped insulate the incumbent from a major challenge.",
      "Yet concerns broke through in a major way after Biden's disastrous June debate performance against Trump, leading to public calls within the party from elected leaders for Biden to end his reelection bid. After building pressure, Biden withdrew from the race and quickly endorsed Harris. Democrats rallied around Harris, who only had around 107 days between her entry into the race and Election Day.",
      "The verdict from voters in November 2024 was a stinging setback for Democrats, who not only lost the White House to Trump once again and control of the Senate, but also failed to win back control of the House. That outcome left some congressional Democrats saying after the election that they should have called on Biden to leave the race sooner.",
      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett told CBS News in November 2024 after the election. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back.\"",
      "Looming over the contest to replace Harrison as the leader of the DNC\u00a0 is the sting from 2024's losses and a Democratic Party brand that has eroded with key segments of voters. The leading contenders to replace Harrison include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\"\u00a0 Martin wrote in his framework pitch for chair. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "Harrison has decided to not endorse in the race to replace him. But he said Martin, the Minnesota Democrat, \"would be one hell of a chair,\" before adding that \"there are a lot of good candidates who I think would do a really good job as chair, as well.\"",
      "Harrison became nationally known in 2020 for his attempt to oust Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina's Senate race. Despite losing, Harrison's run showed progress for Democrats. While Graham had coasted to reelection by around 17 points in 2014, he defeated Harrison by a little over 10 points in the red state.",
      "But Harrison indicated earlier this week he would not be vying for public office again anytime soon. He's eager to spend time with his family and also hopes to focus on rebuilding the South for the Democratic Party.",
      "But those aren't the only reasons.",
      "Harrison said that over the years he had wanted to be the heir apparent to South Carolina U.S. Rep. James Clyburn and the seat the influential leader has held for decades, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump's supporters and its aftermath has dampened those ambitions.",
      "\"I still get goosebumps when I see that dome lit up over there,\" Harrison said, sitting in the DNC building near the U.S. Capitol. \"But to see what happened on January 6, and to see how folks have whitewashed that, particularly on the Republican side, to see the vitriol and the hatred in the body politic right now, is not something that I want to be a part of.\"",

      "\"That's the $64 million question that needs to be answered,\" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, in an interview with CBS News.",
      "The permitted flight ceiling on the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport is 200 feet \u2013 a crucial ceiling for keeping the heavy flow of military helicopters safely clear of the steady commercial aircraft traffic into and out of the nation's capital.",
      "Data from FlightRadar24, which tracks and records aircraft data for most flights across the U.S., showed the helicopter's last estimated altitude was about 400 feet when it crashed. The jet's altitude was about 375 to 400 feet, according to data from FlightAware and FlightRadar24.",
      "\"They're military pilots; they're familiar with the routes,\" Feith said. \"Why is it on this day, on that flight, they were [as much as] 150 to 200 feet higher than they knew they should be?\"",
      "Steven B. Wallace, a former director of accident investigations for the Federal Aviation Administration, told CBS News he believes investigators will direct attention to the altitude of the Black Hawk.",
      "\"I don't want to speculate on the cause, but I can speculate what's going through the mind of the investigators,\" Wallace said. \"I think that is very likely going to be the focus.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the investigation is examining if the aircraft was at the right altitude at the time. NTSB investigators have not so far disclosed the helicopter's altitude in their briefings, and said their working groups will evaluate \"pre-impact course and altitude.\"",
      "The Army helicopter's deviation above the flight ceiling is one of several similar near collisions involving helicopters at Reagan National that date back more than a decade.",

      "The pilot's report said the aircraft \"came within very close contact of another aircraft.\"",
      "\"This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision,\" the 2015 report said.",
      "Two years earlier, in May of 2013, a pilot reported problems with a helicopter while circling to land on Runway 33. That is a shorter runway intended for smaller aircraft, like American Airlines 5342. Pilots who land there told CBS News they want to be at the \"floor,\" or lowest altitude during their approach because they need to hit the beginning of the runway to have maximum distance to stop.",

    "summary": "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a former Blackhawk pilot, talked with CBS News' Nikole Killion about the midair collision of a plane and Blackhawk helicopter.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth is calling for patience as the NTSB and FAA investigate the cause of the tragic collision of a Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines flight Wednesday night, but she is also pursuing information about how it occurred.",
      "She told CBS News' Nikole Killion in an interview Thursday that she's requested a transcript of the air traffic control instructions and responses from the pilots.",
      "\"What I did learn was that air traffic control did contact and speak with the helicopter crew twice, and they acknowledged the instructions twice,\" Duckworth said. \"I also am asking for the flight path of both aircraft up until the moment of the impact.\"",
      "The Illinois Democrat will have more insight than many of her colleagues \u2014 she is an Iraq\u00a0War veteran and was a Black Hawk pilot before an RPG downed her helicopter during an Iraq deployment in 2004, costing Duckworth both of her legs and partial use of her right arm.",
      "Duckworth says she's certain that the soldiers who were piloting the Black Hawk Wednesday night were well trained because otherwise, \"they wouldn't be out there in this special airspace \u2014 the airspace around Washington, D.C.\" She noted that they were in the SFRA \u2014 the Washington, D.C., metropolitan Special Flight Restricted Area. It's a circular 30-nautical-mile area around Washington, D.C., which also surrounds the Flight-Restricted Zone, a smaller area encompassing Reagan National Airport.\"",
      "\"You don't get to fly in that without additional flight training,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat described what the crew would have been doing in the cockpit as the Black Hawk flew Wednesday night.",
      "\"The crew members would have split up the crew duties. One person would have been flying \u2014 actually, physically flying the aircraft, which takes, you know, all of your four limbs to do it,\" she told Killion. \"You're controlling the direction of the aircraft with your right hand, the power that's going into the engines with your left hand, you're controlling the nose and the tail of the aircraft, with your two feet.\" This pilot would have been trying to \"stick to the route,\" while the other pilot would be talking with air traffic control.",
      "\"Everybody's looking outside the aircraft to try to find that other aircraft that you are near,\" Duckworth said. \"The crew chief in the back is also doing the same thing. They're looking out of the aircraft as well, spotting any traffic that's nearby, conveying that information. So, the crew would be talking to each other while also listening to the air traffic controller.\"",
      "At the same time, the crew would also be \"listening to the air traffic controller talking to other aircraft, so that you have situational awareness of everything else that's going on,\" she said.",
      "The helicopter would have had a ceiling, what Duckworth referred to as a \"hard deck\" in the restricted area where the Black Hawk was flying.",
      "\"They're not allowed to go above 200 feet mean sea level,\" she said. \"So, they were flying pretty low above the Potomac River at the time, while looking up trying to spot out of this very busy night sky the landing airplane.\"",
      "Killion asked whether this was the kind of flight that would require night-vision goggles, or NVGs.",
      "\"My understanding is that they were not using NVGs,\" Duckworth replied. She said that in an area where there are a lot of lights, they're \"not as useful a tool,\" and are really more suited to \"a combat situation in the dark.\" Around the airport, \"with that much ambient light, they were on visual flight rules, and they were operating well within the parameters for which they have been trained, and the aircraft was designed to operate in,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She said the helicopter would have had its lights on, so the plane would have been able to see it. But airplanes that are coming in for a landing have the right of way.",
      "\"They would have been looking towards the runway and landing on the runway,\" she said. \"That's the job of the crew within the American Airlines Flight \u2026 they were on a short final to land.\"",
      "\"I'm sure they would have been looking out, but they don't have the same visibility in that aircraft \u2014 looking out those two little windows that they have \u2014 as the helicopter would have had, with plexiglass.\" She explained that the helicopter crew \"would have been basically sitting in a plexiglass bubble in the Black Hawk with plexiglass above your head, underneath your feet and out the two sides.\"",

    "summary": "More than half of Senate Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting for Doug Burgum.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate confirmed Doug Burgum as interior secretary late Thursday after President Trump tapped the North Dakota billionaire to spearhead the Republican administration's ambitions to boost fossil fuel production.",
      "The vote was 79-18. More than half of Senate Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting for Burgum.",
      "Burgum, 68, is an ultra-wealthy software industry entrepreneur who came from a small North Dakota farming community, where he worked at his family's grain elevator.",
      "He served two terms as governor of the oil-rich state and launched a presidential campaign in 2023, but dropped out months later and quickly endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American \"energy dominance.\" He would have a seat on the National Security Council \u2014 a first for the interior secretary.",
      "His directive from Mr. Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",
      "Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor, when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.",
      "He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden, and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.",
      "Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an \"all of the above\" energy policy to favor fossil fuels.",
      "\"They said wind is dead on the offshore. They are trying to do as much of this as possible to create demand for coal, for fossil gas,\" Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a Thursday floor speech.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said Burgum would rightfully prioritize energy innovation over regulation.",
      "\"He's going to take the common-sense action of unlocking our lands for oil and for gas production,\" Barrasso said. He added that more than 600,000 acres of land in Wyoming have been approved for energy production but were not offered for development by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history, according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico, Texas and North Dakota, where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.",
      "The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.",
      "The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",
      "The interior secretary also oversees the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management and other subagencies.",
      "Burgum succeeds Deb Haaland, who under Biden sharply scaled back oil and gas sales and promoted solar and wind projects on federal lands.",
      "Trump made energy development a centerpiece of his first term and is again vowing to abolish restrictions on the industry that are intended to protect the environment and public health.",
      "Burgum, during his hearing earlier this month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, suggested to lawmakers that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels could be captured to neutralize their contribution to global warming.",
      "Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged even as climate change becomes increasingly urgent.",
      "During Haaland's tenure at the Interior Department, officials also reversed actions taken during Trump's first term that weakened protections for imperiled species while making it easier for private developers to pursue projects on public lands.",
      "Republicans in Congress have said they plan to again seek changes to rules on endangered species and they want Burgum to help.",
      "Burgum says federal lands can be used for many purposes including recreation, logging and oil and gas production that can lift local economies.",

    "summary": "President Trump appointed Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency.",
    "story": [
      "As first responders searched the Potomac River Thursday following the nation's deadliest airline crash in nearly a quarter of a century, the agency tasked with regulating civilian air travel was without a Senate-approved head.",
      "President Trump moved Thursday, appointing Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency. Mr. Trump described\u00a0 Rocheleau as \"highly respected.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned when President Trump took office last week. Whitaker held the job for 15 months, with the last few marred by criticism from prominent Trump supporter and now-White House official Elon Musk, who chafed at the agency's oversight of his company SpaceX.",
      "Mr. Trump formally appointed Rocheleau with a memo he signed in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"He's a very capable guy,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Who is Christopher Rochelau?",
      "Rocheleau is in his third stint at the FAA. He was appointed by Mr. Trump as deputy administrator last week, and took on the title acting administrator Thursday morning, hours after an American Airlines jet with 64 people on board and an Army helicopter carrying three collided. Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",
      "What about the Transportation Secretary?",
      "Former Rep. Sean Duffy was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation on Tuesday, after being confirmed by the Senate in a 77-22 vote. The Department of Transportation includes the FAA. Duffy posted on social media Thursday that, \"I want the families of the victims to know that they have my word: I will not rest until you have the truth.\"",
      "\"I will find answers to how this happened. I have directed every relevant agency to immediately investigate what went wrong, and I will not tolerate delays or bureaucratic excuses,\" Duffy wrote. \"If there was negligence, incompetence, or failure anywhere in the system, we will find it\u2014and I will fix it.\"",

The collision of a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter late Wednesday was the first major commercial plane crash in the U.S. in more than a decade.",
      "\"I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "The president's comments drew harsh criticism from the top Democrat in the Senate. \"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories, it's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",

      "The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product \u2014 the economy's output of goods and services \u2014 expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December.",
      "For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023.",
      "The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.",
      "Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters.",
      "Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of the 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge \u2014 called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",
      "But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure \"suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes.",
      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",

      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",

      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",

      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",

      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",

      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space.

    "story": [
      "Get ready for a parade of planets this winter. During the month of January, sky gazers will be able to see four planets in one view \u2014 and come February, the parade will only expand.",
      "NASA says after dark, throughout the month of January, you'll be able to see Venus, Saturn Jupiter and Mars. Venus and Saturn will appear in the southwest of the sky, Jupiter will appear overhead and Mars will rise in the east.",
      "Uranus and Neptune will also be there, but they won't be bright and visible without a telescope.",
      "So-called planetary parades are not super rare, according to NASA, but they don't happen every year. There was\u00a0planetary parade in June 2024 when six planets \u2014 Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn \u2014 all aligned.",
      "These events are often called a planetary alignment, but planets always appear in a line in the sky because they orbit the sun \u2014 the difference is that they will appear closer to each other and Earth, making them visible from our planet.",
      "Saturn and Venus will be making a close approach in January. Their closest approach to each other occurred on Jan. 17 and 18.",
      "Mars and Earth will also align in their orbits, and this will occur around the time when Mars is at its closets to Earth, so it will appear bigger and brighter in the night sky. This is called an opposition and it happens about every two years.",
      "In February, seven planets will be in alignment \u2013 Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Venus, Uranus, Jupiter and Mars. Most will be visible to the naked eye, but to see Uranus and Neptune, you may need a telescope or binoculars,\u00a0according to Starwalk, a sky-gazing app that tracks space events for astronomers and amateur stargazers. This alignment will be most visible worldwide on February 28.",
      "Those who want to see this event should start looking for the alignment as soon as the sun sets. Some places might have a better view of the alignment on different days. For example, in New York, you might see the event best on Feb. 25, according to Starwalk.",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",

      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",

      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

Google also said Denali, a mountain in southern Alaska and North America's tallest peak, is going to be called Mount McKinley on its maps for those same users, reflecting the presidential mandate.",

      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",

      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",

The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president.

Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.",
      "Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude \"en route\" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.",
      "The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.",
      "Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds \"in training\" are counted.",

      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.\"",

And in a separate memo, the deputy attorney general on Friday also ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection undergo review.",
      "Martin's directive, written by Acting Attorney General James McHenry, said the firings would be effective immediately. The memo included an appendix with names of the employees who would be fired.",
      "Some operating under the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., had been hired as term employees to carry out the sprawling Jan. 6 probe. Before the presidential transition, the Biden Justice Department made them permanent employees.",
      "According to the memo, their employment has \"hindered the ability\" of the D.C. U.S. attorney to \"faithfully implement the agenda that the American people elected President Trump to execute.\"",
      "\"The appropriate step is to terminate these employees, and to take all appropriate steps to ensure that resources allocated to their hiring and employment\" are available to current Justice Department leadership, the memo said.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Furthermore, the acting deputy attorney general, Mr. Trump's former defense attorney Emil Bove, has ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The FBI's acting director, Brian Driscoll, sent a letter to all FBI employees in which he detailed the directive, which also included an order to fire eight current FBI executives. As CBS News previously reported, many Executive Assistant Directors, including those who headed up the critical national security, cyber and criminal divisions, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination.",
      "According to a copy of Driscoll's letter also reviewed by CBS News, the Acting Director said of the Jan. 6-related agent lists, \"We understand this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigations. I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director Kissane.\"",
      "Bove's memo ordered the eight executives to be terminated by Feb. 3 and the list of employees who work on the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 be compiled by Feb. 4. The head of the Washington, D.C. Field Office is also expected to be removed from his post by Feb. 10, according to the sources.",
      "Driscoll \u2014 who assumed the top job after former FBI Director Christopher Wray resigned \u2014 told the bureau's employees, \"We are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what's in the best interest of the workforce and the American people.\"",
      "Bove's memo said he was directing the firings and other personnel review to take on allegations of weaponization within the Justice Department.",
      "\"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully,\" Bove wrote of the FBI executives.",
      "Bove's memo also said agents who worked on a case in which the Justice Department charged senior leaders of Hamas with terrorism, murder conspiracy and sanctions-evasion should also be reviewed.",
      "The moves would expand an ongoing purge of employees within the Justice Department and the FBI, where top officials have been told to retire, resign or be fired by Monday. Government officials are reviewing lists of FBI agents who worked on the probes to determine who should be fired and the numbers of agents affected could grow, two of the sources said.",
      "The senior FBI officials receiving notice to resign or be fired include those at the executive assistant director level at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and numerous heads of FBI field offices across the country. The special agents in charge of Miami and Las Vegas offices, as well as the assistant director in charge of the Washington field offices have also received notice, three people familiar with the moves told CBS News. These agents are expected to accept retirement.",
      "The top officials at the executive assistant director level being instructed to retire manage the FBI's criminal, national security and cyber investigations. There may be more changes throughout the FBI, too, sources said.",
      "Some were notified while Kash Patel, President Trump's pick to lead the FBI, faced questions by senators at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. The panel has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "While the number of agents affected by the latest changes remains unclear, the decision to include those who worked on the complex probe into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot could reverberate across the country, since agents from a number of FBI field offices participated in what became the largest investigation in Justice Department history. More than 1,500 defendants were charged in nearly every state, and FBI personnel played critical roles in each case. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The investigation into the Capitol breach has been closed, but multiple people familiar with the matter previously told CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, initiated a review previous charging decisions behind hundreds of cases. That review is ongoing.",
      "FBI agents also worked with federal prosecutors as they investigated and later charged Mr. Trump in two cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith, one tied to the president's handling of classified records and the other related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election. Those agents are expected to be removed from their positions. The charges against Mr. Trump were dropped before his inauguration and the special counsel resigned.",
      "The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment when contacted by CBS News. However, Patel was asked during his confirmation hearing specifically about the firing of FBI agents who worked on the Trump cases.",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" Patel said. He later added that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "In a statement, the FBI Agents Association, which represents active and former FBI personnel, said, \"If true, these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents. Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.",
      "\"These actions also contradict the commitments that Attorney General-nominee Pam Bondi and Director-nominee Kash Patel made during their nomination hearings before the United States Senate,\" the association continued. \"They also run counter to the commitment that Director-nominee Patel made to the FBI Agents Association, where during our meeting he said that Agents would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned.\"",
      "Last week, CBS News reported that more than a dozen federal prosecutors who worked on Smith's team to charge Mr. Trump were fired by the Justice Department.",
      "The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions by a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda, according to two sources.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News at the time.",
      "In all, the moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Earlier this month, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he has applied to the special counsel's prosecutions.",

      "He had studied fine art in Egypt through the generosity of a cousin, and now he sought to make his dreams come true in New York City. But that didn't happen. Instead, he shared a bedroom with construction workers in New Jersey and struggled to find consistent work.",
      "\"I was so na\u00efve,\" Khalil told CBS News. \"I didn't have any plan, just that one-way ticket and my dreams.\"",
      "His dreams of becoming a professional sculptor weren't working out, and he wanted to at least be around art even if he couldn't make a living off it. So, in 2012, Khalil received a job as a security guard at the iconic Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he could at least be in the presence of masters.",
      "\"I was just trying to find any job to make a living because I was in debt,\" Khalil said. \"I sent so many emails. I didn't have any security experience. But this is the Met. I was so happy.\"",
      "Khalil finally had a stable job, but he admits that even standing in the museum, he would often long to be creating something.",
      "\"I cried within myself inside the gallery many times, wondering why it didn't work out for me,\" Khalil said.",
      "Then, a couple years ago, Khalil struck up a conversation with a visitor. At least, he thought he was a visitor. But in fact he was speaking to Akili Tommasino, curator for the Met's Department of Modern of Contemporary Art.",
      "Khalil happened to mention to Tommasino that he was an Egyptian artist himself.",
      "\"When Armia mentioned that he was Egyptian, I asked him if I could see his work, and at that point, I revealed my identity,\" Tommasino said.",
      "In 2018, Tommasino had launched a search for the very best examples of art inspired by ancient Egypt. He spent six years looking far and wide for new art. But it was with a Met security guard that he found a new piece.",
      "The only way Tommasino could explain it was as a \"divinely ordained encounter.\"",
      "Khalil's sculpture, carved out of a single piece of ash wood over the course of five months, is part of a major exhibit on display at the Met through Feb. 17 called \"Flight into Egypt: Black Artists and Ancient Egypt, 1876\u2013.\"",
      "He never imagined that, one day, his work would be here, too.",
      "\"It's unbelievable,\" Khalil said. \"That was a real surreal moment for me.\"",
      "Several people told Tommasino that they have visited the exhibit just to see Khalil's work. He is now a celebrity of sorts, the security guard who guards his own work \u2014 at least for the time being.",
      "\"That is a risk,\" joked Tommasino when asked about losing Khalil as a security guard.",
      "\"I cried,\" Khalil said of the first time he saw his work in the exhibit. \"Everything flashed in front of me. It was surreal. Keep dreaming. Keep hoping all the time.\"",

    "title": "Trump officials make plans to revoke legal status of migrants welcomed under Biden",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 20:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The DHS proposal would terminate a Biden administration program that allowed more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is preparing to revoke the legal status of many of the migrants who were allowed to come to the U.S. legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under former President Joe Biden, according to internal government documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The proposal by the Department of Homeland Security, spelled out in an unpublished notice, would fully terminate a Biden administration program that allowed more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly to the U.S. if American sponsors agreed to help them financially.",
      "The Biden administration argued the policy, known as CHNV, discouraged illegal immigration by people from these four Latin American countries by offering them legal means to come to the U.S., but President Trump froze the initiative hours after being inaugurated. Trump officials have specifically argued the program was a misuse of immigration parole, the legal authority which the Biden administration used to admit those under the sponsorship initiative, and to allow them to apply for work permits.",
      "Under the new move, the Trump administration would revoke the parole status of those allowed into the U.S. under the\u00a0CHNV policy and place them in deportation proceedings if they have failed to apply for, or obtain, another immigration benefit, like asylum, a green card, or Temporary Protected Status, the internal proposal shows.",
      "It's unclear how many of the over half-million people allowed into the U.S. under this initiative have applied for other immigration programs. When the Trump administration's plan will be finalized also remains unclear.",
      "Those whose parole classification is revoked, and who lack another immigration status, would become ineligible to work in the U.S. lawfully. They would also receive notices to appear in immigration court, the first step in the deportation process, according to the internal documents.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration empowered federal immigration agents, including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to seek the deportation \u2014 including in an expedited fashion in some cases \u2014 of those permitted to enter the U.S. under various Biden administration policies, including the CHNV program.",
      "Some of those who have arrived to the U.S. under the CHNV process have access to programs that would protect them from deportation.",
      "Many Haitians and Venezuelans, for example, are enrolled in the TPS program, which, like parole, temporarily shields them from deportation and gives them work permits. But TPS is in the crosshairs of Trump officials, who argue the policy has also been abused.",
      "Just this week, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era extension of the TPS designation for Venezuelans, paving the way for some migrants from Venezuela to lose that status sooner.",
      "Cubans with parole status have unique access to a process to become legal permanent residents due to a Cold War-era law. All nationalities can also apply for asylum, but that requires applicants to prove they are fleeing persecution based on certain factors, like their politics or religion \u2014 a high legal threshold.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Tom Jawetz, a former DHS immigration official under the Biden administration, denounced the Trump administration's plan.",
      "\"Targeting people who came to the U.S. with sponsors and continue to play by the rules isn't just gratuitously cruel, but it will make our system more chaotic,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, who seized on Biden's unpopular immigration policies during the presidential campaign, has staged a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal and legal immigration.",
      "Through a presidential decree, officials have effectively closed down the American asylum system; given ICE officers a broad mandate to target most unauthorized immigrants, including non-criminals; and assigned the Pentagon to help with border enforcement, including through the use of military planes to deport migrants entering the U.S. illegally.",
      "The Trump administration has also taken steps to restrict legal immigration, pausing arrivals of refugees, or people fleeing persecution overseas who are allowed to come to the U.S. lawfully after security and medical checks.",
      "A key component of Mr. Trump's moves have centered on dismantling the Biden administration's immigration legacy. Beyond the CHNV program, the Trump administration has shut down other Biden-era initiatives, including a phone app that allowed migrants in Mexico to schedule a time to enter the U.S. at official border entry points to start their asylum cases.",
      "Trump officials have also suspended processes that allowed the U.S. to welcome Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Afghans escaping Taliban rule and Central American children hoping to reunite with relatives in the U.S.",
      "Like the CHNV program, these policies rely on the immigration parole authority. The Trump administration has ordered officials to review those policies and determine whether they should be permanently terminated.",

      "\"Doctors in every community in America rely on these treatment guidelines to know what tests to run, to know what antibiotic will work on which infection, and how to avoid worsening antibiotic resistance,\" said David C. Harvey, head of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that agency staff had been racing Friday to meet a 5 p.m. deadline set by the Office of Personnel Management, to implement President Trump's executive order that the federal government now only recognizes \"two sexes, male and female.\"",

      "\"People will get sick. And, especially in cases like congenital syphilis where you cannot lose a day to treat, babies will die,\" said Harvey.",
      "Some changes were minor and kept web pages online, like rewording information about Zika virus from saying \"pregnant person\" to \"pregnant woman\" instead.",
      "Others have resulted in gutting key parts of the agency's website. Data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a nationwide survey of high school students about mental health, substance abuse and violence, were also wiped from the website.",
      "The last round of the survey's results had highlighted worsening mental health and violence affecting LGBTQ high school students.",

      "Another targeted mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that similar to federal rules, they also were now required to \"immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting\" those ideas \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contracts\" supported by the funds.",

    "story": [
      "A helicopter was forced to take evasive action to avoid colliding with a plane that was landing at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., during a July 2018 incident that mirrored the deadly midair collision that occurred Wednesday night.",
      "The incident, first reported by CBS News, occurred when a trio of helicopters were traveling along a similar route as the Army Black Hawk helicopter involved in Wednesday's collision. It's unclear who those three helicopters were affiliated with.",
      "In that 2018 incident, a Federal Aviation Administration technical center plane was on approach to Runway 33 when at least one of the helicopters had to take evasive action to avoid colliding with the FAA plane.",
      "Runway 33 was the same runway that American Eagle Flight 5342 was supposed to land on before Wednesday's deadly collision.",
      "Similar to Wednesday's fatal crash, in the 2018 incident only one air traffic controller was managing both local plane traffic and helicopter traffic, a role that is usually staffed by two people. A synopsis from an FAA aviation safety report of the incident stated that the air traffic controller in the tower had failed to issue traffic information to multiple flights on approach to the airport.",
      "In scanner audio obtained by CBS News, the helicopter pilot can be heard telling the air traffic controller that it had to \"divert to avoid that aircraft.\"",
      "The air traffic controller apologized for the near miss to both pilots.",
      "\"I should've been better with that traffic call. Sorry about that. I'm sorry for the confusion,\" the controller said.",
      "The crucial difference between the 2018 incident and this week's collision that killed 67 people was that the 2018 incident occurred in the daytime, allowing for greater visuals from the helicopter to take evasive action and avoid the aircraft on approach.",
      "The FAA did not respond to request for comment.",
      "CBS News has identified at least five close calls between planes and helicopters around Reagan National in recent years.",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter in Wednesday's collision was on a training flight at the time. Lawmakers have raised questions about the safety of having military aircraft practice in the same airspace as commercial aircraft.",
      "\"I have not yet heard a good reason why military helicopters are doing training exercises in the same airspace as commercial airliners \u2013 at night with peak congestion,\" Republican Sen.

      "Billy Nolan, who served as acting administrator of the FAA during the Biden administration, argues that military helicopters should be sharing the air space with commercial aircraft.",

      "Mr. Trump has emphasized ending recognition of DEI issues and observances as a key part of his agenda, and he suggested Thursday that DEI may bear some blame for the deadly collision between a commercial plane and a Black Hawk helicopter earlier this week, though when asked what evidence he'd seen to support the claim, he responded, \"It just could have been.

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 18:09:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House said it will levy new import duties on its three closest trading partners starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados if the Trump administration proceeds with its plan to slap\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners starting Feb. 1.",
      "President Trump will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting this weekend, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "summary": "A memo from the Office of Management and Budget ordering a freeze on federal assistance sparked confusion across the country earlier this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance\u00a0after a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenged a memo from the White House budget office ordering a pause of federal funding.",
      "U.S. District Chief Judge John McConnell of Rhode Island on Friday\u00a0granted the request for a temporary restraining order sought by the Democrat-led states, which had argued that the actions from the Office of Management and Budget violated federal law and the Constitution.",
      "McConnell's order was expected, as he had signaled following a hearing Wednesday that he was inclined to issue the temporary pause of the Trump administration's directive. The judge said in his decision that the Office of Management and Budget's actions are likely unconstitutional and violate federal law.",
      "\"Are there some aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate constitutionally for the Executive to take? The court imagines there are, but it is equally sure that there are many instances in the Executive Orders' wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous 'pause' of critical funding that are not,\" McConnell found.",
      "The judge wrote that the budget office did not cite any legal authority that allowed it to unilaterally suspend the flow of federal funds to states and other entities and said \"no federal law would authorize the executive's unilateral action here.\"",
      "\"The states have set forth facts showing that the executive's abrupt 'pause' in potentially trillions of dollars of federal funding will cause a ripple effect that would directly impact the states and other's ability to provide and administer vital services and relief to their citizens,\" McConnell wrote.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the lawsuit, cheered the court's order and said the president cannot unilaterally stop congressional spending commitments.",
      "\"This administration's reckless plan to block federal funding has already caused chaos, confusion, and conflict throughout our country,\" she said in a statement. \"In the short time since this policy was announced, families have been cut off from childcare services, essential Medicaid funds were disrupted, and critical law enforcement efforts were put in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Democrat-led states filed their lawsuit earlier this week in response to a memo from the Office of Management and Budget that ordered agencies to temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo was issued by Matthew Vaeth, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who said the freeze was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Its full scope was not clear and sparked confusion and chaos around the country as states and nonprofits scrambled to determine whether they would be affected. Lawmakers, too, fielded calls from constituents and organizations in their states seeking answers about whether they would be cut off from federal dollars.",
      "The memo also prompted immediate legal action from the Democrat-led states and a group of nonprofit organizations, who filed a separate challenge in Washington, D.C. A federal judge there swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofits to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "One day later, the Office of Management and Budget issued a new, two-line memo saying that the earlier directive had been rescinded.",
      "But questions continued to arise after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that only the budget office's memo had been walked back and the broader halting of federal assistance would remain in effect.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo,\" she wrote on social media\u00a0Wednesday. \"Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The president's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Following Leavitt's post, the Justice Department argued that the matter before McConnell was moot. But the judge said in his order that \"the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the court.\"",
      "\"The substantive effect of the directive carries on,\" he wrote. \"Messaging from the White House and agencies proves this point.\"",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:28:42 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is set on Feb. 1 to unleash a wave of new import duties\u00a0on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "On Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump on Saturday will imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. She cited \"illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country\" as the reason for the tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump is proposing in putting a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also chose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "If fully enacted, Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support to that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "summary": "Gary O'Hara said President Trump's attempt to blame the Washington, D.C., plane crash on \"DEI\" added to the pain of victims' families.",
    "story": [
      "The father of U.S. Army Black Hawk pilot Ryan O'Hara said his son loved flying over Washington, D.C., never expressed concerns about the crowded skies and described the crew as \"probably the most respected pilots that Ryan had ever flown with.\"",
      "\"He trusted them with his life,\" Gary O'Hara told CBS News in an emotional interview from his home in Georgia Friday, less than two days after his son's military helicopter struck an American Airlines passenger jet. It was the worst air disaster in the nation in more than a decade.",
      "Ryan O'Hara's parents watched on television as their son's body was recovered from wreckage submerged in the frigid Potomac River and transferred to a hearse.",
      "\"It's very touching to see the other soldiers saluting as they take him out with a draped flag over it,\" Gary O'Hara said. \"But to sit there and think that that's my little boy \u2014 it's crushing.\"",
      "He described the burden of experiencing a wrenching personal tragedy that unfolded before a national audience \u2014 and then watching it become grist for a political debate about diverse hiring during a presidential news conference.",
      "He said any attempt to blame the crash on \"DEI\" only added to the family's grief and said no one in the Army lands a spot on a Black Hawk without being qualified.",
      "\"You have to earn your spot to be moved into the ladder to be put into that helicopter. They don't just give it to you. You earn it,\" he said. \"And you know, all of those soldiers that protect us, they earn their stripes every single day.\"",
      "Ryan O'Hara, 28, grew up in the Atlanta area and joined his high school's ROTC as a cadet, even though he wasn't from a military family. He enlisted when he was 18, specifically choosing the Army because it offered him the opportunity to work on Black Hawk helicopters.",
      "After a tour of duty in Afghanistan, O'Hara said his family was relieved when Ryan was assigned to Fort Belvoir in Virginia, just outside the nation's capital. He lived in the Washington region with his wife and 1-year-old son.",
      "\"I was worried when he was in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"You let your guard down \u2026 when he's on American soil.\"",
      "Gary O'Hara said his son loved flying over Washington, D.C., at night, and sometimes would send him photos of the monuments and text that \"D.C. is the most beautiful city in the world.\" He said his son never raised concerns about the dangers of navigating the crowded skies.",
      "He said he began to worry immediately after seeing news of the crash Wednesday night. Even though numerous soldiers crew Black Hawks in the nation's capital, he said he felt instantly that the crash involved his son.",
      "\"My wife was like, 'No, it's not him,'\" he said. \"But my heart just broke.\"",
      "He tried immediately to text his son after seeing the news, but it wouldn't go through. His daughter-in-law called late that night, fearing the worst. The next morning, those fears were confirmed with a knock on the door from two Army soldiers.",
      "\"It's really like your worst nightmare,\" he said.",
      "As he grapples with the trauma of the past 48 hours, he views what occurred over the Potomac River as a freak event.",
      "\"Sixty seconds earlier or later, there's no accident,\" O'Hara said.",

      "UFC President and CEO Dana White criticized mixed martial artist Bryce Mitchell for making antisemitic and homophobic comments on a podcast during which the featherweight also praised former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and denied the Holocaust.",
      "\"I've heard a lot of dumb and ignorant (stuff) said over the years, but this is probably the worst,\" White said\u00a0while addressing the media on Thursday\u00a0in Saudi Arabia. \"First of all, when you talk about Hitler, he was responsible for the death of 6 million Jews and it was his intent to completely eliminate the Jewish people.\"",
      "White said the UFC let Mitchell know what he said was unacceptable.",
      "\"Hitler is one of the most disgusting and evil human beings to ever walk the Earth, and anyone that even tries to take an opposing position is a moron,\" White said. \"That's the problem with the internet and social media. You provide a platform to a lot of dumb and ignorant people.\"",

      "\"That's the beautiful thing about this business. For all of you that hate Bryce Mitchell, you get to see him hopefully get his ass whooped on global television,\" White said, according to CBS Sports. \"What do you want me to say about it? You know where I am with free speech. We're disgusted by it. I think he's literally one of the dumbest human beings.\"",
      "According to CBS Sports, Mitchell is 17-2 as a pro and 8-2 in UFC. He's coming off a TKO win over Kron Gracie in December, which was his first fight since suffering a devastating knockout loss to Josh Emmett in December 2023.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 21:48:50 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after he met Friday with a Trump administration official tasked with urging the authoritarian leader to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the United States.",
      "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Mr. Trump would continue the \"maximum pressure\" campaign he pursued against Maduro during his first term.",
      "Grenell later posted a photo of the six Americans aboard a flight headed back to the U.S.",
      "Grenell's hourslong trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Mr. Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans.",
      "\"We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\" Grenell posted on X along with a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. \"They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.\"",
      "The meeting in Venezuela's capital took place less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.",
      "Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't officially recognized.",
      "\"No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\" Trump responded. \"They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that Grenell is \"meeting with a lot of different people, but we're for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Some Republicans criticized the visit.",
      "\"This is terrible timing,\" said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. \"A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.\"",
      "The dispute over the election results sparked nationwide protests. More than 2,200 people were arrested during and after the demonstrations.",
      "Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans who the government has linked to alleged plots to destabilize the country. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.",
      "A nonprofit group that had advocated for the release of a detainee said David Estrella, a 62-yer-old who was last heard from in September, was among those on their way back to the U.S. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello had accused Estrella of being part of an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a slew of actions to make good on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and carry out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "Those measures include the revocation earlier this week of a Biden administration decision that would have protected roughly 600,000 people from Venezuela from deportation, putting some at risk of being removed from the country in about two months.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday that Mr. Trump had instructed Grenell to \"identify a place and ensure that repatriation flights\" carrying Venezuelans, including members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, \"land in Venezuela.\" She said Mr. Trump also ordered Grenell to \"ensure that all U.S. detainees in Venezuela are returned home.\"",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2013, when its economy unraveled and Maduro first took office. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, migrants increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuelans' desire for better living conditions and their rejection of Maduro are expected to keep pushing people to emigrate.",
      "Ahead of the presidential election last year, a nationwide poll by Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed about a quarter of the population thinking about emigrating if Maduro was re-elected.",
      "Grenell has reached out to Maduro before on Mr. Trump's behalf to secure the release of imprisoned Americans only to come home empty handed.",
      "In 2020, he traveled with Erik Prince, the founder of controversial security firm Blackwater, to Mexico City for a secret meeting with a top Maduro aide. The backchannel talks centered on Maduro's offer to swap eight Americans then imprisoned in Venezuela for businessman Alex Saab, a close ally of the president charged in the U.S. with money laundering, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "No deal was struck and Grenell's demand that Maduro step down was dismissed by the Venezuelan president's envoy. Grenell has always denied he was negotiating a hostage swap.",
      "Later, in December 2023, the Biden administration exchanged Saab for 10 Americans as part of a policy to re-engage Maduro ahead of presidential elections.",

    "summary": "Dual U.S.-Israeli national Keith Siegel is among the 3 hostages expected to be released by Hamas in the fourth swap with Israel.",
    "story": [
      "The group representing the families of Israeli hostages confirmed Friday the names of three more captives whom Hamas is expected to hand over on Saturday, and there's a dual U.S.-Israeli national among them. Keith Siegel, 65, originally from North Carolina, moved to Israel four decades ago and was among those seized during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Hamas had earlier provided three names and Israeli officials confirmed receipt of the list, but it was the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that confirmed the identities, saying it welcomed \"the joyous news regarding the expected release of Keith Siegel,\" along with Israeli nationals Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon.",
      "Siegel's wife Aviva Siegel  was also taken during the attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and take 251 others hostage, but she was released under a brief November 2023 ceasefire and prisoner swap agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Speaking to CBS News about a year after her release, Siegel said there were moments as Hamas militants forced her and her husband through tunnels under the Gaza Strip that they felt \"sure we were going to die.\"",
      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about half a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said it could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",
      "Speaking to CBS Boston only two weeks ago, Calderon's cousin Jason Greenberg said he still didn't know whether Ofer was dead or alive.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine anybody being able to endure that long and even come back the same person,\" Greenberg said. \"If he comes back alive, that's a miracle.\"",
      "The other half of the exchange on Saturday will see Israel release 90 Palestinians from its prisons, Hamas' Prisoners' Media Office said Friday. Among those the group said it expected to be released are nine prisoners who have been serving life sentences and 81 others serving long sentences.",
      "Israeli officials did not immediately confirm the details, but the numbers provided by Hamas were in line with the terms of the ceasefire and the ratio of hostages to prisoners released in the previous three exchanges.",
      "3rd hostage-prisoner exchange completed, but not smoothly",
      "Eight hostages held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza were freed Thursday in exchange for the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, in a third swap facilitated by the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "The exchange began smoothly with the handover of female Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. But the process devolved into chaos when large crowds surrounded Israelis Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses as they were transferred by militants to Red Cross personnel in southern Gaza about an hour later.",
      "The scenes angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delayed the release of the Palestinian prisoners for a few hours until, his office said, mediators of the ceasefire agreement offered guarantees that precautions would be taken to ensure the safety of all further hostages released under the deal.",
      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff ended a visit and left Israel Thursday after the three hostages were released. He spent much of the day visiting Gaza, where he went with members of the Israel Defense Forces, \"to inspect the implementation [of the ceasefire], because it is so important,\" he told Axios.",
      "\"How this happens will influence our ability to get to phase-two of the deal,\" Witkoff said.",
      "Americans still held in Gaza",
      "Seven American citizens, including Siegel, are among the remaining 82 hostages being held in Gaza, both dead and alive.",
      "Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey, are thought to be alive, while four other Americans are thought to have been killed in captivity.",
      "Israel's 15-month, blistering military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack has killed more than 47,400 people in the enclave, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties, and Israel disputed its figures during the course of the war, but a\u00a0study published\u00a0earlier in January in the medical journal The Lancet said the actual toll in Gaza had likely surpassed 70,000 people.",
      "Entire neighborhoods in the densely populated Palestinian territory have been leveled, and virtually all of its more than 2 million inhabitants have been displaced from their homes, many of them multiple times.",
      "Israel expected to allow medical evacuations through Gaza-Egypt crossing",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire with Israel, according to a print draft shared with CBS News by Hamas officials before it took effect, the Israeli military was to allow limited movement of people across Gaza's southern border with Egypt once all of the living female Israeli soldiers held captive were released.",
      "With the release of Berger on Thursday, that appeared set to happen by Saturday.",
      "Both the European Union and the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Friday that they were sending staff to help facilitate the limited opening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt's northeastern Sinai Peninsula.",
      "\"Europe is here to help,\" EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said in a social media post. \"The EU's civilian border mission deploys today to the Rafah Crossing at the request of the Palestinians and the Israelis. It will support Palestinian border personnel and allow the transfer of individuals out of Gaza, including those who need medical care.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said, meanwhile, that a first group of sick and wounded Palestinians would be allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday, with selected patients and their companions being contacted by phone \"to arrange travel procedures after securing approvals from the relevant parties\" in coordination with the World Health Organization.",
      "In his own statement, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed \"the planned medical evacuation of 50 patients via the #Rafah crossing tomorrow \u2014 the first since the ceasefire began and the first through Rafah since its closure in May 2024.\"",
      "The WHO chief added that between 12,000 and 14,000 \"people still require medical evacuation\" from Gaza, and he called for an acceleration of those evacuations \"through all possible routes.\"",

    "summary": "To New Zealand's Indigenous M\u0101ori people, the mountain Taranaki Maunga \"has long been an honored ancestor.\"",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0- A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.",
      "Mount Taranaki \u2014   now known as Taranaki Maunga, its M\u0101ori name \u2014   is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 8,261 feet and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports.",
      "The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the M\u0101ori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since.",
      "The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te K\u0101hui Tupua, which the law views as \"a living and indivisible whole.\" It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, \"incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.\"",
      "A newly created entity will be \"the face and voice\" of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local M\u0101ori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's Conservation Minister.",
      "\"The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and M\u0101ori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.",
      "But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.",
      "In 1840, M\u0101ori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014   New Zealand's founding document - in which the Crown promised M\u0101ori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the M\u0101ori and English versions of the treaty differed \u2014   and Crown breaches of both began immediately.",
      "In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish M\u0101ori for rebeling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management - but M\u0101ori did not.",
      "\"Traditional M\u0101ori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,\" Goldsmith said. But a M\u0101ori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the M\u0101ori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.",
      "Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements \u2014   such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.",
      "\"Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,\" said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.",
      "\"We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,\" she added.",
      "The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.",
      "New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island.",
      "Government ownership of the forest ceased under the law and the tribe T\u016bhoe became its guardian.",
      "\"Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,\" the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to M\u0101ori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.",
      "The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata \u2014 a M\u0101ori song \u2014   from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.",
      "The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law \u2014   which is not expected to pass - would strip M\u0101ori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.",

    "story": [
      "Marianne Faithfull, the British pop star who inspired and helped write some of the Rolling Stones' greatest songs\u00a0has died at the age of 78.",
      "Faithfull passed away Thursday in London, her music promotion company Republic Media said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,\" her spokesperson said. \"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",
      "The pop song ended up on the U.K. and American charts. Multiple hit singles and two debut albums followed.",
      "Jagger said on Thursday that he was \"so saddened to hear of the death\" of Faithfull.",
      "\"She was so much part of my life for so long,\" Jagger said on social media. \"She was a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress. She will always be remembered.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school when her career took off. At 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby but later walked away from both her marriage and her career, for Jagger.",
      "She and Jagger began seeing each other in 1966 and became one of the most notorious couples of \"Swinging London,\" with Faithfull once declaring that if LSD \"wasn't meant to happen, it wouldn't have been invented.\"",
      "But in 1967 when Faithfull was at a party, police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home where drugs were found. The charges were later dropped, but her angelic image was disgraced.",
      "After Jagger and Faithfull broke up, she fell into drug addiction and was homeless by her mid-20s.",
      "In 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, the critically acclaimed \"Broken English.\" But Faithfull was still an addict and it would be six more years before she finally cleaned herself up.",

    "summary": "2 Israeli women and an 80-year-old male hostage, along with 5 Thai nationals, were released in Gaza, but Israel delayed its part of the exchange, accusing Hamas of \"shocking scenes\" at one handover.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Three more Israeli hostages \u2014 two females and an 80-year-old man \u2014 were released in Gaza Thursday as the third hostages-for-prisoners swap agreed to by\u00a0Israel and Hamas\u00a0got underway, but the chaotic nature of the handover of two of the Israelis angered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the extent that he delayed his country's part of the exchange until later in the day.",
      "Israel did start releasing Palestinian detainees from the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank later Thursday, keeping to its part of the third exchange amid the ongoing ceasefire. Buses carrying the what was expected to be 110 prisoners freed on Thursday were seen leaving the prison about two hours after Netanyahu's spokesman said he had \"instructed to delay the release of the terrorists scheduled to be released today \u2014 until the safe exit of our hostages is guaranteed in the next few days.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office released a subsequent statement saying that, following his demand, ceasefire mediators had \"passed a commitment according to which a safe exit will be guaranteed for our abductees who will be released in the next installments. Israel insists that lessons will be learned and that in future times there will be extra care to return our abductees safely.\"",
      "There were some Palestinians among those being released Thursday who had been accused and, in some cases, convicted of serious crimes against Israelis, including murder. Most of the prisoners were being released and allowed to remain in the West Bank, but some were being sent to third countries, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that five Thai nationals were also released Thursday by militants in Gaza, as had been expected, as part of a separate agreement.",
      "The first Israeli released early Thursday was female soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. Berger was the final hostage from an unarmed, all-female Israeli military unit that had been working to surveil Gaza.",
      "Seven women from Berger's unit were taken hostage during Hamas' Oct. 7 2023 attack on Israel, which saw militants kill about 1,200 people and take a total of 251 others hostage.",
      "Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 47,300 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and decimated the Palestinian territory, displacing virtually all of its population and causing a wide scale humanitarian crisis.",
      "Berger was escorted by militants out of the back of a destroyed building in Jabalia. Wearing an outfit that resembled green military fatigues, she was handed over to members of the Red Cross. Photos shared later by the Israeli military showed her reunited with her parents.",
      "Two other Israeli hostages released Thursday were Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, who was the oldest of the hostages. All three of the freed hostages had been transferred from Red Cross care to Israeli forces on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed.",
      "In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency said Yehoud and Moses, along with the Thai nationals, had \"crossed the border into Israeli territory\" and were on their way to a reception point in southern Israel. The statement said Yehoud and Moses would be reunited with their families there, as Berger was earlier, while the five Thai nationals would be met by officials from Thailand's government.",
      "Video showed Yehoud being transferred to the Red Cross, more than an hour after Berger's release, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis amid scenes of mayhem. Yehoud and Moses had been held by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas.",
      "A huge crowd had gathered in Khan Younis to witness the handover, which took place near the home of deceased Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar. Dozens of armed militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad paraded through the area and the handover of the prisoners was chaotic, with armed militants, photographers and civilians crowding around the hostages as they were moved to the waiting Red Cross vehicles.",
      "Netanyahu released a statement condemning the \"shocking scenes,\" calling the crush of people around the hostages \"another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"I demand from the mediators to make sure that such threats will not happen again, and to guarantee the safety of our abductees,\" said Netanyahu.",
      "In its own statement posted online, Hamas called the large crowds, \"a message of determination and defiance raised in the face of this barbaric occupier. It says our people will remain on their land, and are determined to accomplish their project of liberation, return, and self-determination.\"",
      "Hamas did not immediately react to Netanyahu's order to delay the release of 110 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.",
      "Netanyahu's order marked the second delay in the hostage and prisoner swap process laid out by the ceasefire agreement that the Israeli leader blamed on Hamas.",
      "Under to the terms of the deal, Yehoud should have been among the four women released during the second exchange, on Jan. 24. After that release last weekend, the terms of the agreement stipulated that Israel would release a number of Palestinian prisoners from jails and allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, across the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the enclave.",
      "When Yehoud wasn't among those released last weekend, Israel said it would not allow Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor. After a quick negotiation process, Hamas agreed to carry out Thursday's previously unscheduled hostage release, to include Yehoud.",
      "In anticipation of the release and according to the new agreement, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor into northern Gaza on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have made their way back to the north, most of them on foot, some finding the ruins of their homes and the remains of loved ones, but also reuniting with family members they haven't been able to see in months.",
      "Hamas and its allies are expected to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19. It is hoped that negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of the ceasefire plan will start to yield progress soon.",
      "The next exchange, which will be the fourth, is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Netanyahu has said that will include the release of male hostages in Gaza.",
      "The release of the three people on Thursday left 82 hostages \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 still in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, including seven dual U.S. nationals: Keith Siegel, 65, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed. It remains unclear when any of the Americans might be released.",
      "Senior Hamas political official Bassem Naim told CBS News on Wednesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement, \"and we will do our best to make it work and will try to overcome the obstacles and challenges, but we expect that the Israelis will keep trying to find reasons to stop implementing the deal, partly to cover up their failure in achieving any of their goals in Gaza, or due to the scenes that showed the will of the people in Gaza.\"",

      "Both President Trump and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, have claimed that the administration has stopped a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza as part of the new administration's reevaluation of federal funding.",
      "\"We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,\" he said Wednesday. \"They've used them as a method of making bombs.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of State said in 2021 that Hamas and other militant groups have a history of launching incendiary balloons toward Israel. Previous photos taken by The Associated Press in 2020 show masked men attaching incendiary devices to gas-filled condoms and balloons.",

The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News. Available figures from the State Department show that previous shipments for contraception, including condoms, to the Middle East cost far less than $50 million.",

In the decade before fiscal year 2023, there were only two shipments, including one in fiscal year 2019 and one in fiscal year 2013.

      "The Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29, and communities across the United States and worldwide are holding celebrations.",
      "China's most important holiday \u2014 the Lunar New Year is also widely celebrated in South Korea, Vietnam and other countries where Chinese residents make up significant parts of the national population,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Museum of Asian Art.",
      "In the Chinese zodiac, each new year, according to the lunar calendar, is associated with one of 12 animals, and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake. Different regions in Asia may not follow the same zodiac observed in China, and many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders do not observe the Chinese zodiac, said the art museum.",
      "What is the Lunar New Year?",
      "Lunar New Year begins on the lunar calendar's first new moon and continues through the first full moon, which falls 15 days later.",
      "The new moon usually happens at some point between mid-January and early February \u2014 so the start of the new year begins different days depending on the year.",
      "Each year in the lunar cycle is associated with a particular animal, like the ox, the tiger, the rabbit or, as it was last year, the dragon. The Year of the Snake represents a period of transformation, introspection and growth,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Chinese Language Institute.",
      "The lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar, uses the phases of the moon to delineate days, weeks and months of the year. A lunar month is the period of time from one new moon to the next \u2014 about 29.5 days \u2014 so the lunar calendar doesn't precisely align with the common one where most months span 30 or 31 days.",
      "The Chinese government\u00a0officially adopted the solar Gregorian calendar\u00a0more than a century ago to align with the rest of the world. Chinese communities have since\u00a0celebrated both the start of the Gregorian year\u00a0on Jan. 1 and then the Lunar New Year, a reflection of cultural roots, some weeks afterward.",
      "The Lunar New Year is also known as the Spring Festival in China, as a nod to the upcoming spring season. In Vietnam, the holiday is known as Tet, and, in Korea, it's called Seollal.",
      "How to celebrate Lunar New Year",
      "Commemorated through 15 days of cultural festivities, Lunar New Year activities are often centered around various forms of art and cuisine, which can be enjoyed at home and in public forums. Experts say the core focus of Lunar New Year celebrations is to bring families together.",
      "Mario Poceski, a professor of Buddhist studies and Chinese religions at the University of Florida who wrote about Lunar New Year celebrations in The Conversation last year, said holiday traditions typically involve cleaning and decorating the house, shopping for gifts and preparing food for family gatherings, like a traditional dinner held on the eve of the new year.",
      "\"Many of the dishes are assigned symbolic meanings,\" Poceski wrote. \"For instance, dumplings are given the shape of gold ingots to invoke good fortune.\"",
      "Exchanging red envelopes, which contain money, is another popular custom that's carried out each Lunar New Year. The envelopes' red color is featured prominently in decorations for the holiday and represents prosperity and good fortune, Poceski said, adding that older members of the family usually gift them to younger members.",
      "Parades, carnivals and gatherings featuring fireworks, dances and other cultural performances are often staples of Lunar New Year celebrations, as individual residences, shops and markets decorate with lanterns or dragons made from red paper in honor of the holiday.",
      "In Beijing, crowds of people filled a park for a \"temple fair\" Wednesday, with some ringing bells and tossing coins into containers shaped like gold bars for good luck, the Associated Press reported.",
      "In Malaysia, revelers rang in the new year with firecrackers in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city, while Russians cheered for a musical procession in Moscow Tuesday night that commenced a 10-day Lunar New Year festival, according to the AP.",
      "One of many U.S. cities paying homage to the holiday, businesses in Denver kicked off the Lunar New Year with spreads of traditional cuisine and merchandise.",
      "\"To celebrate the cultural side, the celebration of just welcoming in a new year, a vibrant year full of good luck and change,\" Mimi Luong, the co-owner of Denver gift shop Truong An Gifts, told CBS News Colorado this week of her family's celebrations and the store's public observance.",
      "\"Every year, we celebrate with decorating our home with lots of red and gold, and eating long noodles so we can have long life, and dumplings so we can have abundance,\" Luong said.",

He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping.

      "All 14 were remanded in custody to appear in court for sentencing on Feb. 11. Each faces a potential maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "The victim's adult sister, Jayde Struhs, told reporters outside court that she welcomed the verdicts.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of Roman-era gold and silver coins were found in a field outside a village in the Netherlands, officials announced this week.",
      "The coins are thousands of years old, the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency said in a news release, and are a mix of Roman and British coins. Bunnik, the village where they were buried, was once along the northern border of the Roman Empire. It's the first time such a find has been made on the European mainland, the agency said, with the only other comparable discovery having been made in Great Britain.",
      "Two metal detectorists made the discovery, then formally reported the coins to authorities. An archaeologist then examined the findings to confirm their veracity, and a larger excavation was conducted.",
      "The majority of the artifacts were Roman coins dated between 46 and 47 A.D., around the end of the first Roman conquests in Britain, and were primarily stamped with the portrait of the Emperor Claudius. Nearly 300 of the Roman coins are silver denarii,\u00a0minted between 200 B.C. and 47 A.D. Some of those coins are stamped with unique portraits, including several of Julius Caesar and one with the face of Juba, the king of a Northern African region that is present-day Algeria, according to a news release from the National Museum of Antiquities in the Netherlands.",
      "Also found among the Roman coins were 72 gold aurei, dated from 18 B.C. to 47 A.D. Those coins show no signs of wear and likely came from a pile of freshly minted coins, according to the Cultural Heritage Agency.",
      "Several dozen other coins, made of an alloy of gold, silver and copper, come from what is now Great Britain and were stamped with the face of the Celtic king Cunobelinus, who reigned between 9 and 40 A.D. The king's name was also inscribed on the coins, known as \"staters.\"",
      "Roman soldiers returning home likely carried the coins from Britain to Bunnik, the agency said. The British coins may have been spoils of war, while the Roman coins were likely being carried as currency. They may have been buried to hide them temporarily, or as an offering to the gods, possibly as \"an expression of gratitude to the gods for a safe return from battle,\" the agency said.",
      "The Cultural Heritage Agency said the find shows the importance of the Lower Germanic limes, or a series of fortification points along the border between the Roman Empire's Germanic provinces. The limes existed from 83 to about 260 A.D., according to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and separated the empire from Germanic tribes. The coins show that Roman troops returning from Britain used these points as a route to return home.",
      "Three hundred and eighty-one of the 404 coins were purchased by the National Museum of Antiquities. The coins can now be viewed as part of a permanent exhibition at the National Archaeology Collection, the agency said.",

      "Michaels, who is the host of the \"Keeping It Real\" podcast that discusses health, fitness and nutrition, sat down with Fox News Digital to discuss why she believes Kennedy would be the best candidate for the role.",

It's like, yeah, I came across a dead bear and I thought, I'll eat it. No. I left it in the car. OK, hold on. Now, what do I do with it? I'll leave it in the park when someone finds a bear in the park, that'll be funny.

And I think this will be the first time in a long time, at least in the course of my adult life, we have a person who is running HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services, that actually wants to make America healthy again. And that's why I want him in this role. I don't believe that he can be corrupted, and I think that has been the root of America's healthcare crisis for decades,\" Michaels said.",

      "\"So, number one, start with the step goal. I asked for 10,000 steps a day and people are going, \u2018I have no time to do this.\u2019 So hold on and hear me out. I'll take 7,000 steps a day. And the answer is buying a walking pad for a few hundred bucks that you can fold up and put in the closet that has a little platform desk on it. And you can literally stand up, which burns one and a half times the calories of sitting. You can shuffle along at a snail's pace, which is what I do all day long. And over the course of your day, you will hit that step goal. And it doesn't matter if it's hailing cats and dogs outside, because it's an indoor opportunity to move your body while multitasking. So it's affordable, it's accessible, and you can do it while you're doing your day job, right?\" Michaels continued.",

      "\"What I mean by that is if you're going to McDonald's, which of course I don't want you to do, but if you're going there, can you not buy the soda? Right. Can you get the friggin' grilled chicken sandwich instead of the Big Mac and the large fries? People understand that. Use common sense. Get the healthier option and cut half of it and take it home for later. This will save you money.",
      "\"Don't drink calories. How do we cut back on calories? Because we want to use common sense of food choices. Meaning we will remove some of this ultra-processed crap that isn't good for us and will eat less calories, which will help us maintain a healthy body weight.

      "\"Then I would say from there, wherever you can, grab your healthy habits and amplify them.

You should focus on that.",

You know, pick and choose. By all means, but if you can give me a step goal, you can stop drinking calories, you can use common sense with your food choices, and you can really do your best to prioritize your sleep\u2026 That's 90% of the battle.

      "\"It wasn't long ago that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was widely celebrated as a champion of the people. A relentless fighter who took on corporate giants like Monsanto and the pharmaceutical cartels. His work in environmental law helped expose corporations poisoning our water, air, and food supply and his advocacy against Big Pharma's unchecked power made him a rare public figure willing to challenge billion-dollar interests that profit from human suffering.",

      "Michaels continued on X, formerly known as Twitter, \"The media doesn't want you to research these facts for yourself. They want you to accept their cartoon villain version of RFK Jr. without question. Who's panicking?

    "summary": "New research from Japan suggests drinking sparkling water can help support weight loss through satiety and energy production. Researcher Akira Takanashi and nutrition experts discuss this as a method for weight management.",
    "story": [
      "Registered dietitian nutritionist Ilana Muhlstein from Los Angeles breaks down the foods that are considered healthy but are high in calories",
      "Water is known to be a great resource for good health, but sparkling water could also offer unique benefits.",
      "A new report, published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health, suggests that carbonated water may support weight loss by enhancing glucose uptake and metabolism in red blood cells.",
      "The researchers aimed to analyze the physiological effects of carbonated water, as it has been found to induce satiety (feelings of fullness) and gastric motility (movement of food through the body), both of which could reduce hunger.",
      "KELLY RIPA SAYS QUITTING ALCOHOL HAD A SURPRISING EFFECT ON HER WEIGHT",
      "In analyzing a study from 2004, the team found that carbonated water may support weight loss by converting to HCO3 \u2013 a byproduct of metabolism \u2013 in red blood cells and increasing energy production.",
      "Carbonated water that is high in sodium has also been shown to lower blood glucose levels, the report noted. (iStock)",
      "But the effect of this is \"so small,\" the researchers concluded, that it is \"difficult to expect weight loss effects solely from the CO2 in carbonated water.\"",
      "Therefore, the researchers noted that sparkling water should not be used on its own as a weight-loss solution, and should instead be \"integrated into a broader strategy of healthy living.\"",
      "\u2018Unlikely\u2019 to do it alone",
      "Study researcher Dr. Akira Takahashi, head of medicine at Tesseikai Neurosurgical Hospital in Osaka, Japan, conducted the original research 20 years ago.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Takahashi said this new report underscores how carbonated water impacts weight loss by promoting the sensation of fullness, which can reduce food intake and lower overall calorie consumption.",
      "OZEMPIC'S HEALTH BENEFITS KEEP GROWING, BUT ARE THE RISKS WORTH IT?",
      "Carbonated water burning calories through CO2 absorption is \"insufficient to make a significant difference,\" the researcher noted.",
      "\"For instance, during hemodialysis, even with a continuous supply of CO\u2082 for four hours, only about 9.5g of glucose is consumed,\" he said. \"It would be extremely challenging to drink carbonated water continuously for that duration.\"",
      "(Hemodialysis is a treatment that filters waste and water from the blood for people whose kidneys are not functioning correctly.)",

      "\"Therefore, I believe it is unlikely that carbonated water alone could lead to weight loss,\" Takahashi said.",

      "BRAIN AND MEMORY ARE BOOSTED BY EATING ONE PARTICULAR DIET, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"The sensation of fullness when drinking carbonated beverages is thought to result from their physical properties,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "Weight loss can occur when engaging in increased physical activity, decreasing caloric intake and eating a healthier selection of food, which includes minimizing ultraprocessed, fried and sugary foods, the nutritionist said.",
      "Carbonated consequences",
      "While bubbles in carbonated water can create a full feeling, there are also consequences of overindulging, according to DeCicco.",
      "\"I can see how drinking carbonated water can make people less hungry because the bubbles do create a feeling of more fullness, so with that being said, people may skip a snack if they\u2019re drinking seltzer, thus reducing caloric intake for the day,\" she commented.",

      "On the other hand, DeCicco cautioned, carbonated beverages can make individuals feel bloated and gassy, and can aggravate reflux issues.",

      "\"It would eliminate all of the unnecessary restrictions for local law enforcement to cooperate with federal law enforcement in order to go after those that have been accused or convicted of sex trafficking of minors, and currently there is a clause that they cannot communicate as openly as possible,\" Sanchez told Fox News Digital in an interview.",

      "California Republican Assemblymember Kate Sanchez discusses her new bill to crack down on sex traffickers that may be covered under a state penal exception. (Fox News Digital Screenshot/AP Photo/Gregory Bull)",
      "These restrictions are part of California's \"sanctuary state\" policies, which are designed to limit state and local law enforcement's involvement in federal immigration enforcement. For her part, the specific provisions that Sanchez wants to amend are found in the California Values Act (SB 54), which was enacted in 2017, that restricts local law enforcement agencies from using resources to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect or arrest individuals for immigration enforcement purposes.",
      "There are exceptions in SB 54 for individuals convicted of certain serious or violent crimes. However, sex trafficking is not always classified as a violent felony under California law \u2013 making it so that some convicted sex traffickers may not meet the criteria for local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities \u2013 potentially thwarting deportation efforts.",
      "Sanchez argues this creates a loophole that could allow illegal immigrants who are involved in sex trafficking to remain in the U.S. after serving their sentence. In 2023, Newsom signed Senate Bill 14 (SB 14), reclassifying the trafficking of a minor as a \"serious\" felony, but other forms of human trafficking may still not be considered violent felonies under state law.",

      "A new scam has come to light targeting residents across the United States with text messages that pretend to be from toll road operators. For many who receive these messages, it\u2019s an easy and expensive trap to fall into.",
      "The scam begins when people receive a message claiming they have unpaid tolls and may be charged fines. Scammers then ask for card details and a one-time password sent via SMS to steal their money. Security researchers believe that Chinese smishing groups are behind this scam, selling SMS-based phishing kits to thousands of scammers.",

      "As reported by\u00a0KrebsOnSecurity, the scam begins with a text message claiming to be from a toll road operator, such as E-ZPass or SunPass. The message warns about unpaid tolls and the possibility of fines, forcing recipients to act quickly. Victims are directed to a fake website mimicking the toll operator\u2019s site, where they are asked to provide sensitive information, including payment card details and one-time passwords.",
      "Security researchers have traced the scam to Chinese smishing groups known for creating and selling sophisticated SMS phishing kits. One such kit, \"Lighthouse,\" makes it easy for scammers to spoof toll road operators in multiple states. These kits are designed to trick users into sharing financial information, which is then used to commit fraud.",
      "Reports of these phishing attacks have surfaced across the U.S., targeting users of toll systems like EZDriveMA in Massachusetts, SunPass in Florida and the North Texas Toll Authority in Texas.

      "3) Do not share personal information:\u00a0Never provide sensitive details like payment card information, Social Security numbers or one-time passwords via text or unverified websites. Legitimate toll operators will not request such information through SMS.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",
      "5) Be wary of urgency in messages:\u00a0Scammers often create a sense of urgency, claiming immediate action is required to avoid penalties. Take a moment to assess the situation and verify the legitimacy of the message through official channels.",
      "6) Report suspicious messages:\u00a0If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

At best, identity theft will steal away your time and patience. But more often, identity theft leads to severe consequences, like losing control over your financial accounts, having your credit score affected or even losing lifelong savings.",

      "With so much of our lives having moved online, identity thieves are having an easier time than ever. Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target. Maybe your identity was stolen, and the thieves failed, or maybe your good online habits saved you without you even knowing, which brings us to the next lesson: prevention.",

Even if a thief has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second step, like a code sent via text message or app-based verification.

      "Another sneaky tactic is\u00a0phishing, where scammers trick you into giving away your card info by posing as legitimate companies via emails or fake websites.",
      "There\u2019s also the risk of \"card skimming,\" where devices at ATMs or gas stations secretly capture your card details when you swipe it. In some cases, fraudsters might also exploit weak security on\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks or compromised apps to access your information while you\u2019re shopping online.",

With four out of five American adults owning at least one credit card, the report found that three in five cardholders have faced unauthorized charges \u2014 an estimated 128 million victims. Even more concerning, 75% of these victims reported having their credit card information stolen more than once.",
      "The typical unauthorized transaction is around $100, which adds up to approximately $5 billion in criminal purchases each year. Interestingly, most unauthorized transactions involve credit cards that weren\u2019t physically lost or stolen, highlighting the growing risks of online fraud and data breaches.",

      "The need for identity theft protection",
      "Data breaches are one of the main ways credit card fraud happens. Hackers often get unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by businesses or institutions. When a retailer, financial institution or online store experiences a data breach, the hackers usually go after the payment systems where customer credit card details are kept.",
      "If these systems aren\u2019t properly secured, hackers can grab things like credit card numbers, expiration dates and sometimes even security codes. Once they have that info, they can either use it themselves or sell it to others.",
      "But it\u2019s not just credit card information at risk.\u00a0Data breaches can also expose personal details like names, email addresses and phone numbers. Scammers can then use this stolen info to launch phishing attacks, pretending to be trusted companies and tricking you into giving away more sensitive information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "This is why identity theft monitoring is so important. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of some identity theft protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees\u00a0and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "10 ways to protect yourself from credit card fraud",
      "1. Notify your credit card issuer immediately: If you notice fraudulent charges on your credit card, start by calling the number on the back of your credit card. From there, you should get more detailed information on what to do next.",
      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card. If you receive an alert for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, you can take immediate action to report it and prevent further charges.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",
      "8. Use EMV chip technology: When making in-person purchases, always use the chip reader instead of swiping your card. Chip technology provides an extra layer of security against fraud.",
      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Keep your card in sight:\u00a0When using your card in restaurants or stores, try to keep it within view. This reduces the risk of someone copying your card details.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's clear that credit card fraud is more prevalent than ever, affecting millions of Americans each year. The good news is that there are effective steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim. By staying vigilant and employing best practices \u2014 like monitoring your statements and using strong passwords \u2014 you can significantly reduce your risk. Remember, awareness and proactive measures are your best defenses against credit card fraud.",

      "\"There's opportunities to improve the technology that is kind of the backbone of air traffic control,\" Biffle said. \"If you look to Europe, for example, there are some opportunities that we could adopt here that would be much more efficient \u2014 you'd burn a lot less fuel, get there faster and so forth. That is a big opportunity.\"",
      "\"At the same time, it doesn't negate the issue that I think we're 3,000 controllers short right now. And so that just causes, when you have a weather event, it just causes there to be more delays,\" he explained. \"And ultimately, like we've seen the last few days, those delays then turn into cancelations because crews time out and so forth. [I] would really like to see the staffing get fixed. The technology is probably a longer solution.\"",
      "The FAA's National Airspace System (NAS) safety review team created in April 2023 following several close runway incursions during takeoffs or landings at busy airports, determined that year that the concurrence of several challenges such as the air traffic control staffing crunch, insufficient funding and outdated technology \"results in an erosion of safety margins that must be urgently addressed.\"",

The IRGC Brigadier General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, the father of the IRGC's missile program, personally pursued the project.\"",
      "It is unclear what level of nuclear payload the Ghaem-100 missile would be capable of carrying at the range of 1,800 miles, though this is still shy of the roughly 3,400 miles needed to be classified as an intercontinental missile.",

However, Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown is raising some concerns for Indians.",

The immigration unease also comes as H-1B visas, one of the most common legal pathways of entry for Indians, have been a hotly contested topic by Trump\u2019s supporters.

      "Trump threatened high tariffs on imported goods throughout his presidential campaign and slammed India as a \"very big abuser.\" During his first term, Trump dubbed India the \"tariff king\" amid trade disagreements.

      "A French top official said that the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next decade, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official couldn't be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",

      "The 10-year term for director was created as both a check on the FBI director\u2019s power and an attempt to ensure the director\u2019s independence from the White House. J.

      "Today\u2019s FBI is even more powerful than the bureau of the 1970s. It has a vast electronic surveillance capability, a fleet of aircraft, sophisticated technical capabilities and one of the best-trained paramilitary squads. In addition to criminal investigations,\u00a0FBI agents run some of the most sensitive investigations in the U.S. government, including hunting for spies and terrorists.",
      "Some agents are hoping that the new administration will bring positive changes.

      "\u201cThis is having a big chilling an effect,\u201d another FBI official said. \u201cWhich I imagine is the desired impact.\u00a0Those who are able to retire are strongly considering it. Program managers, finance, intel, etc.\u00a0This is the institutional knowledge base.\u201d",
      "The official added, \u201cThe general sentiment is that they would rather retire than stay in this environment, but they are torn between the mission and retirement.\u201d",

    "title": "Pentagon removes major media outlets, including NBC News, from dedicated workstations as part of a new 'rotation program'",
    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 06:01:57 GMT",
    "summary": "NBC News, The New York Times, National Public Radio and Politico must vacate their Pentagon office spaces in two weeks for other media organizations \u2014 including at least one that did not request to be added.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Defense announced Friday night that it will institute a new \u201cannual media rotation program\u201d for its in-house press corps, effectively removing several major news outlets, including NBC News, from their Pentagon office spaces in favor of other outlets.",
      "In addition to NBC News, The New York Times, National Public Radio and Politico must vacate their dedicated workspaces. The news organizations found out in a memo sent to the press corps without being individually notified, and an accompanying email included a message that read, in part, \u201cno additional information will be provided at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor over a half-century, the Pentagon Press Corps has benefited from working out of individual office spaces that provide coveted and open access to some of the Department\u2019s top military and civilian leaders,\u201d read the memo Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot sent to the Pentagon Press Association.",
      "\u201cIn order to broaden access to the limited space of the Correspondents\u2019 Corridor to outlets that have not previously enjoyed the privilege and journalist value of working from physical office space in the Pentagon, beginning February 14, 2025,\u201d Ullyot wrote, there will be \u201ca new Annual Media Rotation Program for those dedicated media spaces.\u201d",
      "In a statement, NBC News said, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we\u2019ve used for many decades. Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.\u201d",
      "The move by Pentagon officials comes seven days after the Senate confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth by the narrowest of margins. It followed weeks of coverage about his behavior and treatment of women, including allegations that his alcohol consumption alarmed colleagues and his second wife feared for her safety around him. Hegseth has denied the allegations.",
      "NBC News reported on some of the allegations against Hegseth.",
      "The memo identified the rotating organizations by medium \u2014 selecting one each from TV, print, radio and online news to swap in and out. It said the news organizations rotating out had two weeks to vacate their spaces.",
      "The new outlets rotating in\u00a0are One America News Network \u2014 which will take NBC News\u2019s spot \u2014 the New York Post, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost.",
      "Three of the new outlets are conservative, while HuffPost leans progressive.",
      "HuffPost does not have a Pentagon correspondent, and the site did not request a space, spokesperson Lizzie Grams said.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump administration and Secretary Hegseth are interested in more hard-hitting coverage of their stewardship of the Defense Department from HuffPost, we are ready to deliver,\u201d Grams said.",
      "A One America News spokesperson said in a statement that the news outlet has operated a bureau in Washington since 2013, and it \u201clooks forward to having access to physical office space at the Pentagon and will utilize the accommodations full-time as soon as it\u2019s available.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the other news outlets for comment.",
      "The memo did not include further details about the process of the new \u201crotation program,\u201d including how officials chose which outlets needed to vacate office space first, how the new outlets were chosen and which are next, and how long an outlet would remain without an office space before it was rotated back into the building.",
      "NBC News has held its dedicated Pentagon workspace for decades, enabling the network to broadcast its journalism throughout the day and within minutes of breaking news. The \u201cbooth,\u201d as they are called, is hardwired with technical equipment, phone lines and a camera installed by NBC.",
      "It is unclear whether NBC News will have the technical capability to broadcast from the Pentagon once it clears out its equipment from its workspace.",
      "Ullyot noted that the vacating outlets continue to be members of the Pentagon press corps, meaning, in part, they \u201cwill be able to attend and cover briefings and be considered for travel with civilian and military leaders in the Department as they have previously.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon Press Association on Friday evening issued a statement\u00a0saying, \u201cOur resident press corps has greatly expanded over the years and we have always welcomed new members and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are, however, greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media who have covered the Pentagon for decades, under both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe have asked for a meeting and we will keep everyone informed.\u201d",
      "At her first press briefing this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was \u201copening up the briefing room to new media voices.\u201d The first people she called on were Mike Allen of Axios \u2014 a longtime political journalist at a site considered mainstream \u2014 and Matt Boyle of Breitbart, a conservative site.",
      "Leavitt also said her team was working \u201cdiligently to restore the press passes of the 440 journalists whose passes were wrongly revoked by the previous administration.\u201d"

      "The email said the employees are to recognize only two sexes, male and female, according to a memo, obtained by NBC News.",
      "Among the CDC pages missing on Friday was one with information on contraception and emergency contraception. Information on contraception and the abortion pill, or mifepristone tablets, can still be found on CDC webpages through more detailed searches, but those main landing pages have been made to appear blank and might halt users seeking more background on the topics.",
      "In a December interview, Trump said he \u201cprobably\u201d would not restrict the availability of medication abortions during his second term in the White House."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 03:50:03 GMT",
    "summary": "Before socialite Sante Kimes' decades of crime and deception were uncovered, employee Elmer Holmgren vanished without a trace.",
    "story": [
      "The phone call was chilling.",
      "Ken Holmgren didn\u2019t talk to his father often, but during that February 1991 call, Elmer Holmgren told his son that if he didn\u2019t hear from him again in a few days, he should call an agent with the ATF, the federal agency now known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "\u201cPanic struck,\u201d Ken Holmgren, 71, told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cI really didn\u2019t know who he was working for.\u201d",
      "He said he knew that his father, a lawyer who\u2019d struggled to find work after the death of his employer in Florida, had moved to Las Vegas and was working for a wealthy couple, Kenneth and Sante Kimes.",
      "But Ken Holmgren didn\u2019t know about Sante\u2019s lengthy criminal history, mostly for theft-related charges, he said. Nor did he know that she\u2019d recently served three years in a federal prison for charges of indentured servitude. She and her husband \u2014 who took a plea agreement in the case \u2014 had been accused of abusing young undocumented women whom they\u2019d recruited to work as housekeepers.",
      "Holmgren never heard from his father again. But less than a decade later, Sante Kimes captured national attention with a pair of brutal and puzzling crimes that spanned thousands of miles. Sante Kimes and her younger son, Kenny Kimes Jr., were charged and convicted in separate trials in connection with two 1998 murder plots \u2014 the killing of a New York City socialite, Irene Silverman, and the fatal shooting of a Los Angeles businessman, David Kazdin.",
      "During his trial for Kazdin\u2019s killing, the son confessed to a third murder \u2014 the killing of a bank executive who\u2019d gone missing in the Bahamas in 1996 while investigating irregularities in the Kimes\u2019 offshore bank accounts.",
      "Now, decades later, the mystery of what happened to Elmer remains. As does his son\u2019s frustration that, in his view, authorities never seemed to have sought answers in the disappearance. Holmgren said that it\u2019s even more maddening given that when he vanished, his father was cooperating with the ATF as a witness against Sante Kimes and her husband in a suspected arson at their Honolulu home \u2014 an arrangement that Holmgren said he later learned of from a special agent with the ATF.",
      "\u201cIf the ATF would have done their job, there would have been several more people that wouldn\u2019t have lost their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I look at it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the ATF would not comment. The person Holmgren identified as the special agent who provided information about his father\u2019s role in the fire and his apparent cooperation with the bureau retired from the ATF and did not return a message seeking comment.",
      "In response to a public records request from \u201cDateline\u201d for documents linked to the suspected arson in Honolulu \u2014 as well as another possible arson at a Las Vegas property that belonged to the Kimes \u2014 the bureau\u2019s parent agency, the Department of Justice, provided a management log last fall. The document said that all but one piece of evidence had been destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, where federal offices were located.",
      "In 2003, most of that remaining evidence was returned to representatives for Sante and Kenny Kimes Jr., according to the log. The bureau would only provide them with copies of a photo album whose ownership was unclear, the log states.",
      "Sante Kimes died in 2014 at a New York prison at 79. Kenneth Kimes Sr. died in 1994. The couple was never charged with any crimes in connection with the suspected arson. A spokesperson for the ATF would not comment. Police reports obtained through a public records request from the Honolulu Police Department, which also investigated the fire and describe the blaze as a suspected arson, do not provide an explanation of the case\u2019s outcome.",
      "Kenny Kimes Jr., 49, was a teenager at the time of the fire and is not suspected in Elmer\u2019s disappearance. He is serving a sentence of life without parole at a California state prison.",
      "Living the high life",
      "The fire erupted around 1 a.m. on Sept. 16, 1990, in the Kimes\u2019 beachfront home southeast of Honolulu. Video from the time showed the house fully engulfed in flames.",
      "It wasn\u2019t the only home that belonged to the Kimes. Kenneth Kimes Sr. had made his fortune in real estate, and the family had multiple properties in Hawaii, as well as in Las Vegas and an oceanfront estate in the Bahamas, said Kent Walker, Sante Kimes\u2019 older son from a previous marriage.",
      "\u201cOur lives were beyond the American dream,\u201d Walker told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "Honolulu fire investigators determined the blaze had multiple points of origin \u2014 the primary bedroom, dining room, living room \u2014 and described its cause as incendiary, indicating it was intentionally set, according to the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s case file on the fire.",
      "A follow-up report included in the file, which was obtained through a public records request, described a recent legal dispute over the property\u2019s sale: After a buyer in Colorado paid $1.7 million for it the prior year, the money was placed in escrow. But a person whose name is redacted in the document \u201creneged on the deal giving various excuses for not selling,\u201d according to the report, which cited a representative for the buyer.",
      "The property had a $900,000 lien on it, the representative said, and a trial over the dispute was scheduled for Jan. 21, 1991 \u2014 four months after the house burned.",
      "According to an incident report included in the records request, a person whose name is redacted in the document is described as having hired a suspect to burn her home. (The suspect\u2019s name is also redacted.) The homeowner then filed an insurance claim seeking $1.4 million, the report states.",
      "Vanished while in protective custody",
      "A few months after the fire, Holmgren said, he got the first of two phone calls from his father. In the first conversation, Holmgren recalled, his father told him he was working for the Kimes and appeared reluctant to even be on the phone.",
      "\u201cI gotta make this short,\u201d he recalled his father saying.",
      "A few weeks later, in early February, Elmer called again and provided his son with the names of two ATF agents in Honolulu, said Ken Holmgren, who at the time was living in Florida and working as a contractor for a power company.",
      "If Elmer didn\u2019t get back to him in three days, Ken Holmgren recalls him saying, his father instructed him to call the bureau.",
      "\u201cIt was very stressful,\u201d Ken Holmgren said.",
      "A few days later, when Holmgren still hadn\u2019t heard from his father, he dialed one of the agents while at work and left a message.",
      "Shortly after, Holmgren said, two carloads of ATF agents appeared at his job. The person who took the message had garbled it, he said, and believed that Holmgren was actually his father.",
      "\u201cMy boss was a little taken aback, but he was very understanding,\u201d Holmgren said.",
      "Initially, he said, the ATF agent offered few details about his father\u2019s link to the bureau. Elmer was supposed to have been in protective custody, he recalled the agent saying, but \u201cthey lost track of him.\u201d (A spokesperson for the agency said the ATF places people in protective custody with the United States Marshals Service when there is a perceived or known threat to a person\u2019s safety.)",
      "A couple months later, Holmgren said, the agent offered more details: His father had been involved in the suspected arson at the Kimes\u2019 Honolulu property \u2014 a fact that Elmer revealed to a friend at a bar. That friend then shared that information with authorities, Holmgren said the agent told him."

    "story": [
      "The New York Blood Center, one of the country\u2019s largest nonprofit blood donation and distribution centers, has canceled appointments and blood drives after a cyberattack.",
      "In a statement posted to its website Wednesday, the blood center said hackers attacked it with ransomware Sunday, significantly reducing its operations.",
      "The group is still accepting blood donations, but is cautioning donors to expect longer wait times. It has no estimated timetable for fully restoring its operations.",
      "Independent blood suppliers like the blood center, the largest in the New York City area, provide 60% of the U.S. blood supply, according to America\u2019s Blood Centers, a nonprofit that represents blood donation centers across the country.",
      "Ransomware is a type of cybercrime in which cybercriminals lock up an organization\u2019s computer networks and demand a payment in bitcoin for a code or program to make them usable again.",
      "For a victim organization, containing a ransomware attack often means taking computers offline and either working to rid each one of the malicious software or replacing devices entirely. Even if the victim pays, ransomware can be extremely disruptive.",
      "The New York Blood Center has canceled eight blood drives scheduled for Friday and nine for Sunday over the attack, it announced Friday.",
      "It was already under significant strain before the cyberattack.",
      "Last week, it announced a blood emergency. A combination of factors, including winter travel and school breaks, has led to its supplies of types O and B blood dropping to levels that could only last one or two days.",
      "Allan Liska, a ransomware analyst at the cybersecurity company Recorded Future, told NBC News that ransomware attacks against medical nonprofits and other sensitive organizations are now commonplace.",
      "\u201cWe should be shocked by this latest attack, but we\u2019ve seen ransomware groups hit food banks, children\u2019s hospitals, and this isn\u2019t even the first time a blood bank has been hit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat actors behind ransomware attacks simply do not care who they starve or kill with their attacks.\u201d",
      "Ransomware is still a persistent problem, Liska said. Recorded Future recorded 4,634 publicly reported attacks in 2024 around the world, he said, up from 4,400 in 2023."

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 02:42:54 GMT",
    "summary": "DENVER \u2014 A tour guide killed at a former Colorado gold mine last year fell out of a crowded elevator taking tourists below ground after apparently not latching its door closed, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.",
    "story": [
      "DENVER \u2014 A tour guide killed at a former Colorado gold mine last year fell out of a crowded elevator taking tourists below ground after apparently not latching its door closed, documents obtained by The Associated Press show.",
      "As the elevator descended, the door swung out and caught the side of the mine shaft, the guide fell out, was dragged and ended up landing on top of one of the tourists as the elevator continued its descent, investigators determined.",
      "The harrowing account of the October accident that killed Patrick Weier, 46, at the Mollie Kathleen Mine in the mountains near Colorado Springs was included in an investigative report obtained by AP in response to a public records request.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office announced earlier this month that Weier\u2019s death was caused by \u201coperator error\u201d but did not explain how he died or what the error was. State mining regulators inspected the mine after the accident and did not find any problems with the equipment there.",
      "Steve Schafrik, a University of Kentucky associate professor of mining engineering, said that at commercial mining operations, an elevator will not move if the safety systems are not in place and functioning. However, he said he did not have experience with operations in former mines that are now only used for tours.",
      "Surveillance video showed that in the minutes prior to his death, Weier loaded the group of tourists onto the lower level of a double-decker, cage-like elevator for a 1,000-foot descent into the mine. But he had trouble squeezing in himself because it was so crowded, said the report by the Teller County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "The tourists who were in the lower section with him told investigators that Weier had asked them to squeeze together more so he could fit inside, according to the report. A woman suggested that he ride in the upper level of the elevator since the people were smaller, but she said he didn\u2019t respond.",
      "Weier barely had enough room to reach his hand out to close the door, and he did not appear to have secured its latch, the report said.",
      "Within a few seconds of starting the descent, passengers said the elevator started to hit the wall of the shaft. Weier cursed and said things like \u201cI can\u2019t stop this,\u201d and debris was flying at the passengers in the dark. Some lost their hard hats and, without much light, they had to rely mostly on sounds to try to make out what was happening.",
      "According to the report, about halfway down the shaft, the door opened, came off its track and bent as it scraped along the elevator shaft. Investigators believe Weier fell out after ringing the bell to tell the operator to stop the elevator. At first he was trapped between the shaft wall and the still-moving elevator and ultimately fell into the top elevator car.",
      "When the elevator suddenly stopped, the group in the compartment above then said someone else was in their car \u2014 Weier. His body landed on top of a woman, who said it felt like she was being suffocated by it.",
      "A woman in the lower car was pinned by the bent door until others could free her.",
      "Two women in the top car decided to climb up a ladder seeking help. They said the ladder was breaking as they went, but both made it up safely.",
      "The accident left a second group of tourists stuck for hours 1,000 feet (305 meters) below ground, as authorities worked to make sure the elevator could safely bring them back up.",
      "No one answered the phone at the mine and its owner did not respond to telephone messages or an email. The mine\u2019s website says it is closed until further notice.",
      "Weier had a 7-year-old son and was from the nearby town of Victor, Colorado. Some people who went on tours at the mine with him have donated to an online fundraiser for his son, saying his knowledge about the area\u2019s mining history left an impact on them."

    "summary": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also\u00a0sued by the Texas attorney general\u00a0in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription\u00a0to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are\u00a0intended to protect prescribers\u00a0who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, called the indictment a \"cowardly attempt\" to \"weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American.\"",
      "James added, \"we will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers\u2019 ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\u201d",
      "Pills have become the\u00a0most common means\u00a0of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to\u00a0challenge federal government approvals\u00a0for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The hack of PowerSchool appears to be the largest breach of American children\u2019s personal information to date, school officials and cybersecurity experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The hack of a company that helps schools track tens of millions of students appears to be the largest breach of American children\u2019s personal information to date, school officials and cybersecurity experts say.",
      "And a specially commissioned interim cybersecurity audit by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike showed that the company had apparently failed to take basic precautions to protect students\u2019 data, according to a copy exclusively obtained by NBC News and records of internal discussions.",
      "The company, PowerSchool, is best known for its Student Information System (SIS), one of the most widely used education tech programs in the U.S., and one of the breached systems. The SIS software helps school districts keep track of K-12 students, collecting information like their name, school, birthday, address and parent or guardian. Many districts go further and add information like their Social Security number, health concerns or disciplinary records.",
      "Theft of children\u2019s data is regarded as particularly egregious, as they usually have no agency in how it\u2019s protected. It can be difficult to draw a direct line from a particular data breach to a given instance of identity theft, as cybercriminals repeatedly repackage and resell victims\u2019 information. But identity theft cost Americans around $43 billion in 2023, according to a 2024 study by AARP.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the significance of this incident and are deeply regretful that it occurred,\u201d Beth Keebler, a PowerSchool spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. \u201cPowerSchool has significantly invested in its cybersecurity program, culture, and talent over the years \u2014 this has been a diligent and continuous area of focus and one the Company plans to continue to invest in.\u201d",
      "Cybercriminals who steal sensitive data often threaten to publish it if they\u2019re not paid a ransom. PowerSchool declined to comment to NBC News about any extortion demand or payment. But in a private virtual briefing with customers, the company\u2019s chief information officer, Mishka McCowan, said the company had paid the hacker and received a video of them appearing to delete the stolen data, a person who attended the call told NBC News.",
      "Cybersecurity experts caution that cybercriminals can backtrack on promises not to release data, and it\u2019s impossible to verify that the hacker didn\u2019t make backup copies.",
      "In December, a hacker gained what appears to be full access to the SIS information of those schools that had used customer support. While not the entirety of PowerSchool\u2019s customer base, the breach appeared to expose the data of tens of millions of American children. While exact numbers are still unclear, the hacker has claimed the figure to be 62 million. That figure was first reported by the tech news site Bleeping Computer.",
      "As of Thursday, the breached data did not appear to be publicly available online.",
      "Private assessments of the hack show the company failed to take basic steps to protect students\u2019 data. PowerSchool hired the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to help investigate the breach. An interim report prepared by CrowdStrike and disseminated to some school officials, the contents of which had not previously been public and which was acquired by NBC News, found no evidence that the hackers used malware or found a backdoor into PowerSchool\u2019s systems. Instead, the hacker simply obtained a single employee\u2019s password. That granted access to a \u201cMaintenance Access\u201d function that let them download millions of children\u2019s personal information.",
      "According to the CrowdStrike report, the company was not even aware that it had been the victim of such a massive hack until late December, several days after it happened, when the hacker contacted the company to inform it and ask for a payment.",
      "CrowdStrike declined to comment, in line with industry practice.",
      "In a private online chat that included company executives and school representatives, an executive admitted that the hackers were able to access and download the student records by logging into one account that didn\u2019t have two-factor authentication enabled, one of the most basic cybersecurity standards for any account, particularly one that has access to sensitive information. One participant, who requested not to be named, took a screenshot of the chat and shared it with NBC News.",
      "Bill Fitzgerald, an independent security consultant for schools, said that was an example of poor security, though not uncommon in the EdTech industry.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not enforcing multifactor authentication, that\u2019s just not best practice,\u201d Fitzgerald told NBC News. \u201cBut this happens all the time.\u201d",
      "Doug Levin, the national director of K12 SIX, an industry nonprofit devoted to helping schools guard themselves from hackers, blamed lax cybersecurity standards across what\u2019s referred to as EdTech, the industry of education-focused technology that schools increasingly rely on, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic. Levin told NBC News that the hack and the lack of safeguards were both extreme but\u00a0still emblematic of the industry.",
      "\u201cFor a sector so integral to the American way of life, it is unconscionable that neither K-12 schools \u2014 nor their vendors \u2014 are held to a cybersecurity standard of practice,\u201d he said, referencing cybersecurity issues that plague the sector. \u201cThis incident is unique both for its scope and the sensitivity of the data.\u201d",
      "PowerSchool declined to share specifics on how many students were affected by the hack, citing its ongoing investigation, but a spokesperson said the company was confident the number of students whose Social Security numbers were compromised was less than 25% \u2014 a figure that could still reach into the tens of millions.",
      "Terry Loftus, the chief information officer for the San Diego County Office of Education, where seven districts are PowerSchool customers, told NBC News he was particularly concerned about hackers accessing additional student information that some school districts include in SIS.",
      "\u201cWe may be talking about disabilities and what supports are being put in place for special education students,\u201d Loftus said. \u201cThis is massively sensitive, and something that\u2019s of high value to threat actors, as far as reselling to various nefarious groups or data brokers.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs it stands right now or as it appears, unless we hear otherwise, this will likely ultimately be the largest breach of K-12 students,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "In some cases, former students\u2019 information was also in the PowerSchool program and their personal information was stolen as well, the company said in a press release.",
      "There is no formal public accounting of PowerSchool\u2019s reach, but it has statewide contracts with Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina, though use of the SIS software can vary within a state. Other states where schools have warned students and parents about the PowerSchool breach include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",
      "Georgia broadcaster 11Alive has estimated from the state\u2019s Department of Education figures that more than 230,000 current students in the state may have been affected.",
      "In some cases, school districts have warned that the hackers stole remarkably specific information. Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind announced that the hackers gained access to not just students\u2019 names, birthdays and grades, but also their locker numbers and combinations and the balances in their lunch accounts.",
      "Sarah Powazek, the director of the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s public interest cybersecurity program, which offers cybersecurity help to schools and other civic organizations that may not be able to afford it, said schools are in the unfortunate position of trusting companies like PowerSchool to protect their students\u2019 private information.",
      "\u201cSchool districts really have no control over this product, and it\u2019s not up to them whether or not PowerSchool itself is implementing the correct security procedures within their own organization. The schools are very much at the mercy of these educational technology products,\u201d Powazek told NBC News.",
      "Publicly, PowerSchool has said it takes pains to ensure high cybersecurity standards. In 2023, CEO Hardeep Gulati joined then-first lady Jill Biden at a White House event promoting EdTech cybersecurity. The company\u2019s website says it takes a litany of steps to protect kids\u2019 and teachers\u2019 data, including routine security audits and \u201cExtensive and ongoing security/cybersecurity training for all our employees.\u201d",
      "PowerSchool is a signatory to another pledge, created by the nonprofit Future of Privacy Forum, in which it promises to take a series of basic steps to protect students\u2019 information. A spokesperson for the Future of Privacy Forum told NBC News that PowerSchool\u2019s status as a signatory is currently under review for \u201cpotential violations of the company\u2019s Student Privacy Pledge commitments.\u201d"

      "As arrests of immigrants increase, the administration is scrambling to make sure it has the room to house its detainees and keep President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to deport them.",
      "Trump\u2019s \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, told NBC News that Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs 100,000 beds total, more than double what it has currently. Trump alluded to the need for more room when he ordered the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday to prepare 30,000 beds at Guant\u00e1namo Bay for who he said would be detainees posing the greatest threat to Americans\u2019 safety.",
      "An immigration detention room is used to hold people until they are deported, and it \u201cis really kind of a backbone of the mass deportation plan,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst with the National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we see [ICE] floating numbers. They talk about doubling the space to hold people in these ICE jails,\u201d Franzblau said.",
      "The Biden administration made an average of 282 immigration arrests per day in September 2024, the most recent ICE data available.",
      "So far, using seven days of data, the Trump administration\u2019s daily average is 791.",
      "Homan said his instructions to officers and agents were \u201carrest as many as you can.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration launched its mass deportations operation despite ICE\u2019s $230 million budget shortfall. The first bill Trump signed this term, the Laken Riley Act, requires ICE to detain undocumented immigrants who are arrested or face charges or who have been convicted of\u00a0\u201cburglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\u201d But it didn\u2019t include new money to detain those additional immigrants, which DHS said in December it would need.",
      "As of January, ICE reported it had at least 106 facilities nationwide. Congress appropriated funding to detain an average of 41,500 people a day, at a cost of about $3.4 billion.",
      "That was an increase over fiscal year 2023, when Congress provided funding to detain a daily average of 34,000 people, costing about $2.9 billion. The House is in the midst of trying to hammer out a budget bill that would include money for Trump and his immigration crackdown; congressional Republicans have put the price tag at about $100 billion.",
      "The cost of each ICE detention bed is $57,378 per year, per bed, according to DHS data.",
      "Daily detention numbers reached a height of 50,000 average daily population under the first Trump administration, but fell to about 20,000 when Covid hit.",
      "A vast network",
      "The thousands of immigrants taken into custody each year are often locked up in a vast network of facilities, some owned by the federal government and state or local governments but most contracted from private entities.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union discovered through open government requests that the Biden administration was seeking to expand detention space nationwide.",
      "The Trump administration has already begun to supplement the space it\u2019s using.",
      "DHS is using facilities at Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, for processing immigrants with criminal charges or convictions who were arrested in ICE operations in the state. The military made the space available, possibly to be used for a previously planned operation in Aurora.",
      "The Trump administration has instructed the Justice Department to investigate for potential prosecution state or local officials who resist enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "Some states, such as Illinois, have limited or ended immigration detention. New Jersey banned the building of new immigration detention centers, though private companies have sued to block that law. But other local and state governments have long had contracts with ICE for detention space.",
      "Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand in Geauga County, Ohio, said his department has had a contract for 15 to 20 years with ICE to hold immigrant detainees. Hildenbrand said ICE brought in 20 people who\u2019d been arrested over the weekend, raising the detainee population to 58, but since then, ICE removed six people from the jail.",
      "He said as far as he knew, none of those brought in were wanted on local warrants.",
      "\u201cThey called us and asked \u2018Do you have room for 20?\u2019 and brought them in,\u201d Hildenbrand told NBC News.",
      "Hildenbrand said the immigrant population in the jail has generally been steady.",
      "He said his facility has 182 beds and typically can take in as many as 60 to 70 immigrants, depending on how many other people are in the jail who are not ICE detainees. The county is paid $100 a day for each detainee.",
      "The immigration detention system has been a continuous target of criticism from immigrant advocates and government watchdogs over conditions including lack of access to attorneys and substandard medical care as well as issues of cost and effectiveness.",
      "The section of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention facility that Trump wants to use has been housing adults and families with young children interdicted at sea as they\u2019ve tried to flee to the U.S. It is separate from the military prison where the U.S. placed detainees after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "The refugee families detained there have included people and children from Cuba who have tried to escape the Cuban government, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project, IRAP, which documented in a report the conditions and some of the experiences of adults and children held there.",
      "In its report, IRAP said former clients, detained refugees and former staff described the building where they were incarcerated as dilapidated with mold and sewage problems. They reported that families with young children were housed with single adults. Those held are unable to have confidential phone calls with attorneys and are punished if they discuss being mistreated.",

    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is blocking those who took part in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol from working in state jobs, ignoring President Donald Trump's attempt to offer them a clean slate last week in a sweeping set of pardons and commutations.",
      "Late Thursday, Pritzker directed the state\u2019s Department of Central Management Services, the state\u2019s primary hiring authority, to restrict hiring of those who took part in the attack on the Capitol by declaring they had taken part in \u201cinfamous and disgraceful conduct that is antithetical to the mission of the State.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese rioters attacked law enforcement officers protecting people in the Capitol, disrupted the peaceful transfer of power, and undermined bedrock principles of American democracy,\u201d Pritzker said in a written directive obtained by NBC News. \u201cOur State workforce must reflect the values of Illinois and demonstrate honesty, integrity, and loyalty to serving the taxpayers. No one who attempts to overthrow a government should serve in government.\u201d",
      "Pritzker\u2019s new directive marks the first and most direct pushback to Trump\u2019s power spree that has tested the bounds of presidential authority through a fray of executive orders, including some that have drawn judicial rebuke.\u00a0The Democratic governor of the Midwestern blue state has for years acted as an antagonist to Trump.",
      "Pritzker's directive is likely to draw legal challenges, but sources familiar with it said that working through the personnel code was thought to serve as the best legal footing should it face court pushback.",
      "In his first day in office last week, Trump issued a sweeping order that pardoned about 1,500 people and commuted the sentences of 14 others who had stormed the Capitol building in the wake of Trump making false claims that the 2020 presidential election Joe Biden won was stolen.",
      "Individuals associated with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, were among those who were commuted. Trump deemed \u201ca full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u201d a category that included people who assaulted law enforcement officers.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times previously reported that Trump\u2019s actions in absolving those taking part in Jan. 6, may have affected more than 50 Illinois residents, including those still facing prosecution, since Trump also ordered the attorney general to seek dismissal of all pending indictments. Illinois employs roughly 53,000 individuals.",
      "Pritzker has also pushed back on other Trump actions, including to a recent, confusing memo that called for a freeze in federal aid. A judge in Washington, D.C. temporarily blocked that directive, and the following day, the White House rescinded the memo.",
      "\"The US Constitution does not grant the President this unilateral authority,\" Pritzker wrote on X.  \"In Illinois, we will stand against unlawful actions that would harm millions of working families, children, and seniors.\""

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump is reversing the Civil Rights Division's positions on major legal issues, including voting rights, abortion rights and DEI initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump kicked off his second presidential term with dozens of executive orders, many of which focus on hot-button culture war issues, from transgender and abortion rights to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The job of enforcing the administration\u2019s position on those issues will largely fall to the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division.",
      "During past handovers between Democratic and Republican administrations, the Civil Rights Division has undergone major policy shifts.\u00a0During the George W. Bush administration, for example, the division focused resources on fighting religious discrimination. After Barack Obama took office, the division prioritized preventing racial and ethnic discrimination.",
      "The scale of the expected civil rights policy changes between the Biden and Trump administrations may eclipse those of past transitions.",
      "Former Justice Department officials and advocates told NBC News they expect the new administration to swiftly carry out sweeping reversals of most major Biden administration civil rights policies.\u00a0Already, the Trump-run department has issued a memo freezing all action in civil rights cases, including filings and settlements, and withdrawn from multiple cases filed during the Biden administration.",
      "As it has in other parts of the Justice Department, the Trump administration has made personnel changes in the Civil Rights Division. The top two officials in its appellate section have been reassigned to a new task force that will prosecute officials from sanctuary cities who do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts, according to a DOJ official familiar with the matter.",
      "Conservative California attorney",
      "To lead the charge, Trump nominated California lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, 56, who has alleged fraud in the 2020 election,\u00a0accused Google of discriminating\u00a0against white men and spoken out against state laws to protect doctors who perform gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors.",
      "\u200b\u200bJustin Levitt, deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division under Obama, expressed concern over Dhillon\u2019s nomination, saying\u00a0most of her casework has\u00a0focused on \u201ccultural grievance issues.\u201d",
      "He argued that Dhillon largely hasn\u2019t focused on the traditional mission of the Civil Rights Division, which was established by the passage of\u00a0the 1957 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination against all people in the United States, with a focus on vulnerable groups.",
      "\u201cMany of the country\u2019s civil rights statutes were passed in order to preserve and protect the civil rights, particularly of underrepresented and underprivileged groups,\u201d\u00a0said Levitt, who added, \u201cThere is still, unfortunately, no shortage of discrimination in America today.\u201d",
      "Dhillon, who is awaiting Senate confirmation, declined to comment. The Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Jesse Panuccio, who was an acting associate attorney general in the Justice Department during Trump\u2019s first term, praised Dhillon and Trump for their aggressiveness.",
      "\u201cOther Republican administrations have either not had the experience or the courage to make these moves, and it appears President Trump in his second term \u2014 after all he\u2019s faced \u2014 is going full throttle this time,\u201d Panuccio said. \u201cThere\u2019s no adjustment period. They are starting Day One to implement the agenda he campaigned on, and they expect career officials to faithfully execute those policy decisions.\u201d",
      "Panuccio added, \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to pull any punches this time around, and I think they\u2019re going to make sure the Civil Rights Division is consistent with the president\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
      "Targeting DEI",
      "One of the most visible aspects of Trump\u2019s first week in office has been the elimination of government DEI initiatives that sought to expand opportunities for underrepresented groups.",
      "Last week, Trump signed an executive order abolishing the initiatives and directing agency heads and the attorney general to identify private-sector targets that the Civil Rights Division could sue as part of a plan to \u201cdeter DEI programs or principles that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\u201d",
      "One person eager to see DEI policies abolished is Edward Blum, who has, for years, initiated lawsuits arguing that affirmative action programs are discriminatory. His legal campaign culminated with his 2023 victory before the U.S. Supreme Court in the Harvard\u00a0case, which outlawed the use of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education.",
      "Blum and his organization, the American Alliance for Equal Rights, have since then pursued new claims against private companies to stop race-based DEI policies.",
      "\u201cThe American Alliance for Equal Rights would welcome the United States Department of Justice to voice their support for the colorblind legal covenant that binds us together as a multiracial nation,\u201d Blum said.",
      "Rolling back LGBTQ protections",
      "The Justice Department is expected to release new guidance on transgender workers and students, which would affirm the LGBTQ rights reversal Trump initiated last week. He tasked the department last week to\u00a0\u201ccorrect\u201d the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cmisapplication\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a0Bostock ruling, which\u00a0found that federal law prohibits workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "\u201cThe phrase \u2018gender\u2019 has been hijacked to mean something that was infused with complete ideology,\u201d said\u00a0Roger Severino, a vice president at the conservative Heritage Foundation who spent seven years as a career lawyer in the Civil Rights Division. \u201cIt has confused matters, and we need clarity, because we\u2019re dealing with real human beings.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration leaned on the 2020 ruling when it released new Title IX regulations on protections for LGBTQ students, spurring pushback from conservatives who alleged they could endanger females and allow transgender athletes in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "\u201cTitle IX was passed by Congress to protect women\u2019s rights, not the rights of men pretending to be women, in sports and equal treatment in our educational institutions,\u201d Dhillon said in a 2024 television interview.",
      "The Civil Rights Division, meanwhile, can change course in several transgender rights cases prioritized by the Biden administration, including a statement of interest filed in rebuke of a West Virginia law banning transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports. The state has a request for review pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt would send the message that the Trump administration is concerned about women\u2019s sports,\u201d said Jim Campbell, chief counsel of the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group.",
      "Inaction on voting rights",
      "The Civil Rights Division plays a role in protecting the right to vote, an area that has become more contentious since Trump claimed that the 2020 election was stolen and that undocumented immigrants are illegally voting for Democrats.",
      "In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the Civil Rights Division and immigrant rights organizations sued Virginia, alleging the state was illegally purging its voter rolls within 90 days of an election, a violation of the National Voter Registration Act.",
      "A federal judge put a halt to the purges, but the ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed them to continue up until Election Day. The Justice Department withdrew from the case, which remains active, on Tuesday evening, days before Civil Rights Division lawyers were due in court to defend their position.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed,\u201d Brent Ferguson, a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center who argued the case on behalf of the immigrant rights groups, said of the move.",
      "\u201cThe DOJ represents the United States and the American people, and having them withdraw from a lawsuit like this is a problem, because it shows that the government is less willing to enforce our voting laws,\u201d Ferguson said.",
      "The Civil Rights Division has additional cases still pending against various states alleging discriminatory violations of the Voting Rights Act. Hans Von Spakovsky, counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights from 2001 to 2005, said the Justice Department should reverse course and dismiss the pending cases.",
      "\u201cThey need to look at those cases, and based on the evidence we now have from how turnout wasn\u2019t affected, they need to dismiss them and not continue to litigate what I consider to be abusive cases,\u201d Von Spakovsky said.",
      "Backing abortion-rights\u00a0opponents",
      "Former Justice Department officials, including Von Spakovsky, said the new administration has the ability to\u00a0determine whether ongoing cases in which abortion-rights opponents were charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act have merit.",
      "During the Biden administration, Von Spakovsky said, many anti-abortion-rights advocates were charged under the 1994 law, which preserves access to reproductive health clinics, crisis pregnancy centers, faith-based facilities and churches.",
      "At least a dozen\u00a0cases involving anti-abortion-rights defendants have been filed since 2020, according to federal court records tracked by NBC News. Trump last week pardoned nearly two dozen abortion-rights opponents, several of whom were involved in a recent blockade of a reproductive health clinic in Washington, D.C.",
      "As of Monday, the Civil Rights Division had dismissed two civil cases that were filed against defendants accused of obstructing access to reproductive health clinics in Florida and Pennsylvania.",
      "Von Spakovsky praised Dhillon\u2019s arrival.",
      "\u201cThe most important factor of getting someone in that position is that you get someone who actually believes in the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cHarmeet Dhillon is a fighter and has been very strong in opposing discrimination of all kinds.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Democrats will take their first tangible step this weekend to drag themselves forward from their 2024 election loss: electing the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "The party\u2019s committee members will meet Saturday to vote on a new slate of officers, chief among them the person who will replace outgoing chair Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic Party leader whom Joe Biden tapped to helm the party during his time in office.",
      "But while Democrats are set to pick their party\u2019s next chair, they\u2019re not anointing the party's next leader.",
      "Instead, the incoming DNC chair will take the reins of the fundraising, spending and staffing plans for an organization that spent just shy of $1 billion the last four years. While the national party organization helps set the party\u2019s message and can serve as a home base for a party out of the White House, whoever wins Saturday's vote will be more in charge of laying groundwork for a Democratic renaissance than leading them back to power himself.",
      "That\u2019s why the chair\u2019s race has become less of a battle for the soul of the party and more a nuanced debate between front-runners who agree on a lot \u2014 and understand that the next chair will need to wade into the nitty-gritty of party-building instead of grabbing headlines.",
      "\"What this person will really be tasked with at the end of the day is planning a primary process, making sure that the state parties have the funding and infrastructure they need to be successful, and planning our next convention,\" said Matt Corridoni, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for the DNC and on a past race for DNC chair. \"This person is more so a custodian, I think, for the nuts and bolts of operating the party than anything else.\"",
      "In a crowded field, two Democratic state party chairs\u00a0from the Midwest are touting the most support from DNC members: Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin\u00a0and Wisconsin\u2019s Ben Wikler.\u00a0Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who ran for president in 2016, is seeking the spot as well.",
      "Martin, 51, has led the party in Minnesota (where it\u2019s called the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party) since 2011, rising in his more than a decade there to lead the Association of State Democratic Committees and become a DNC vice chair, accruing many allies along the way. He regularly touts how his party-building has coincided with an uninterrupted streak of statewide wins for Democrats since he took over, amid GOP victories in some other Midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d states.",
      "Martin has pitched himself as an experienced party hand who understands the balance between party-building and working to repair the party's brand.",
      "\"For the first time ever in American history, the perceptions of the two political parties has changed. The majority of Americans now believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is a party the wealthy and elites. That is a damning indictment on our party,\" he said during a forum hosted by MSNBC on Thursday night.",
      "But he argued that victories for Democratic-aligned proposals on ballot measures in red states serve as proof that the party doesn't need a \"wholesale abandonment of our message,\" but a shift.",
      "\"Anyone saying we need to start over with a new message is wrong,\" Martin said. \"We've got the right message. What we need to do is connect it back with the voters and make them feel again that we're fighting for the issues that they're supporting.\"",
      "Wikler, 43, became the chair of the Wisconsin Democrats in 2019 after working in leadership at the progressive activist group MoveOn.org. He gained prominence after a string of high-profile victories in the tightly divided swing state: Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential win, Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 2022 re-election, Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s 2024 re-election despite President Donald Trump's win in the state, and flipping the state Supreme Court. He has built up permanent campaign infrastructure in the battleground state and touted it as a model for the party nationwide.",
      "Wikler has based his campaign on not just his success building a party in Wisconsin, but also his energetic approach to fighting back to regain the ground Democrats have lost.",
      "\"As we reel with shock at the horrors that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who is ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back in this moment when our country is reeling and waiting for leadership,\" he said during Thursday's forum.",
      "\"I\u2019ve done this in Wisconsin, a state rigged to be red,\" he continued. \"I\u2019ve done this in a fight against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. If I\u2019m the DNC chair, we will meet this moment now with a fight it requires.\"",
      "The state of the race",
      "Martin has sought to position himself as the front-runner from the moment he jumped in, quickly rolling out endorsements from voting members of the DNC, where Martin has been a fixture for more than a decade. He has much more public support from voting DNC members than the other candidates (almost 200, according to an NBC News count, compared with about 70 for Wikler and 30 for O\u2019Malley). That's close to the majority of the 448 members needed to win the post.",
      "Wikler said he had secured public and private support from more than 180 DNC members, and he has aimed for some late momentum, rolling out endorsements from seven sitting governors (including potential presidential hopefuls Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Andy Beshear of Kentucky), major unions and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",
      "O\u2019Malley, 62, is the only other candidate to tout significant support from DNC members. His biography is unique compared with the two party leaders, as the only major candidate who has been elected to public office. He ran for president in 2016 after serving as Maryland's governor, before becoming Biden\u2019s Social Security administrator.",
      "\"To define our greatness as a country, I would define it as when we return to our truest selves and act like it again, seeing the dignity of every single person,\" O'Malley said Thursday when he addressed the Democratic National Committee's Poverty Council.",
      "\"We come out of this election an election that cries out for change, cries out for new leadership, cries out for battle-tested leadership that can go head-to-head against an administration that is antithetical to everything that you care about, antithetical to our professed belief as a nation and the dignity of every person,\" O'Malley continued.",
      "Faiz Shakir, a longtime adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has also worked for other Democratic Party leaders, jumped into the race just a few weeks before the election. While his pitch to lead the party is unique among the most notable names in the race, he doesn't appear to have a groundswell of support from the DNC members who will make the decision.",
      "While the ballot is not technically secret, DNC members\u2019 votes aren\u2019t made public until after the election, giving ample room for members to change their mind. And if no candidate walks into the first ballot with the majority, a multitude of dynamics could determine the eventual winner as the race goes to multiple votes.",
      "Looming over all of it is Trump and the Democratic Party\u2019s diminished standing after a demoralizing presidential election.",
      "There isn\u2019t much disagreement about the task ahead for the new DNC chair, just over who has the right credentials and approach to help the party put its best foot forward.",
      "All the major candidates want to implement a \u201c50-state strategy,\u201d a hallmark of former chair Howard Dean\u2019s term that began in 2005 (albeit now with a rhetorical flourish aimed at elevating territorial Democratic Party organizations, too, a \u201c57-state\u201d strategy). All of them emphasize the need to bring their message to new media outlets to reach voters who are less plugged-in.",
      "And all of them have signaled some support for a postmortem look at Democratic spending, after an election where they lost ground almost uniformly despite significantly outspending Republicans.",
      "While none of the main candidates are running directly against national party leadership or calling for a wholesale reimagining of the party, there's a near unilateral belief that the party needs to do more to meet the moment.",
      "\"I'm gonna start with a show-of-hands question,\" MSNBC's Symone Sanders told the field of chair candidates at Thursday's forum. Sanders is a former senior adviser to both Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris who is also the host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d",
      "\"Who thinks that the Democratic Party, the Democrats, have responded sufficiently to Donald Trump's almost 11, 10 days in office?\" she asked.",
      "Not one major candidate raised their hand."

      "U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell, in Rhode Island, said in his ruling that the wide-ranging directive in the Office of Management and Budget memo that caused chaos and confusion this week in Washington and across the country appeared to violate the law.",
      "\"The Executive\u2019s action unilaterally suspends the payment of federal funds to the States and others simply by choosing to do so,\" the judge wrote.",
      "\"The Executive cites no legal authority allowing it to do so; indeed, no federal law would authorize the Executive\u2019s unilateral action here,\" McConnell added, granting the coalition's request for a temporary restraining order.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",

      "The judge noted that after the memo was rescinded, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tweeted: \u201cThis is\u00a0NOT a rescission\u00a0of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court\u2019s injunction. The President\u2019s EO\u2019s on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\u201d",

      "\u201cBased on the Press Secretary\u2019s unequivocal statement and the continued actions of Executive agencies, the Court finds that the policies in the OMB Directive that the States challenge here are still in full force and effect and thus the issues presented in the States\u2019 TRO motion are not moot,\u201d he wrote.",

      "The memo said the pause would allow the administration to review which programs are \u201cconsistent\u201d with President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. It said Social Security, Medicare and direct payments to individuals should not be impacted, but was vaguely worded, causing confusion about what aid would be halted. After it was issued, there were reports of people and organizations unable to access systems to receive their federal aid.",
      "The memo also led to a pair of lawsuits before it was rescinded \u2014 one by a coalition of nonprofits in Washington, D.C., and another by the coalition of states and the District of Columbia.",
      "On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan paused the administration's directive to allow for full arguments on it the following week.",

      "\u201cAre there some aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate constitutionally for the Executive to take? The Court imagines there are, but it is equally sure that there are many instances in the Executive Orders\u2019 wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and ambiguous \u2018pause\u2019 of critical funding that are not,\u201d his decision said. \u201cThe Court must act in these early stages of the litigation under the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 because the breadth and ambiguity of the Executive\u2019s action makes it impossible to do otherwise.\u201d",
      "The judge's temporary restraining order indefinitely blocks the administration from freezing existing federal financial assistance to states until he rules on a forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction from the states.",

Most countries deem them illegal under international law, a position disputed by Israel which sees the territory as a security bulwark.",

      "Officials from the Trump administration had said earlier on Friday that one of Grenell\u2019s top aims for the visit was to secure the release of Americans detained in the country, at a time when the Trump administration has been driving a deportation and anti-gang push in the United States.",
      "Grenell did not name the six men, shown with him aboard an airplane in a photo he posted online. They were dressed in light blue outfits used by the Venezuelan prison system.",
      "\u201cWe are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\u201d Grenell posted on X. \u201cThey just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn\u2019t stop thanking him.\u201d",
      "Trump cheered the move in his own post, saying Grenell was bringing \u201csix hostages home from Venezuela.\u201d",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Americans were being held by Venezuela, but Venezuelan officials have spoken publicly of at least nine.",
      "Maduro\u2019s officials have accused most of them of terrorism and said some were high-level \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The Venezuelan government regularly accuses members of the opposition and foreign detainees of conspiring with the U.S. to commit terrorism. U.S. officials have always denied any plots.",
      "\u201cAmerican hostages that are being held in Venezuela ... must be released immediately,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special\u00a0envoy\u00a0for Latin America, said earlier on Friday, adding the Grenell-Maduro meeting was \u201cnot a negotiation in exchange for anything.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are things where we\u2019ve reached initial deals and when they are complied with, new issues will open, hopefully new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,\u201d Maduro said, adding he would be looking to see if what had been discussed with Grenell was reflected in what is communicated by the U.S. about the meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe would like it to continue.\u201d",

      "An agreement on Tren de Aragua deportations was \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab said last week that the gang had been dismantled in Venezuela in 2023, but that it was willing to restart legal cooperation with the U.S. in order to extradite gang members.",
      "Since taking power on Jan. 20, Trump has kicked off a\u00a0sweeping immigration crackdown, pledging mass deportations.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States were eligible for deportation reprieves granted by the previous administration, but U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would cut the duration of the protections. She must\u00a0decide by Saturday\u00a0whether to terminate them.",
      "Grenell\u2019s visit does not mean the United States recognizes Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, Leavitt said.",
      "The two countries have a fraught recent history marked by broken relations, sanctions and accusations of coup-plotting.",
      "But they share interest in several\u00a0pending bilateral issues, including a license allowing U.S. oil major Chevron\u00a0to operate in Venezuela.",
      "The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated broad oil sanctions after it said Maduro failed to keep promises for a free presidential election and later\u00a0increased rewards\u00a0for the capture or conviction of leaders including Maduro, leaving Trump limited options for further penalties.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government-backed victory in the July 2024 vote is contested by the opposition, international observers and numerous countries, including the United States.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government has always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures which amount to an \u201ceconomic war\u201d designed to cripple Venezuela.",
      "The Financial Times reported on Friday that Chevron is trying to protect a special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela.",
      "Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth told the newspaper the company would engage with the White House, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered and Trump said the U.S. would likely\u00a0stop buying oil\u00a0from Venezuela."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Defense announced Friday night that it will institute a new \u201cannual media rotation program\u201d for its in-house press corps, effectively removing several major news outlets, including NBC News, from their Pentagon office spaces in favor of other outlets.",
      "In addition to NBC News, The New York Times, National Public Radio and Politico must vacate their dedicated workspaces. The news organizations found out in a memo sent to the press corps without being individually notified, and an accompanying email included a message that read, in part, \u201cno additional information will be provided at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor over a half-century, the Pentagon Press Corps has benefited from working out of individual office spaces that provide coveted and open access to some of the Department\u2019s top military and civilian leaders,\u201d read the memo Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot sent to the Pentagon Press Association.",
      "\u201cIn order to broaden access to the limited space of the Correspondents\u2019 Corridor to outlets that have not previously enjoyed the privilege and journalist value of working from physical office space in the Pentagon, beginning February 14, 2025,\u201d Ullyot wrote, there will be \u201ca new Annual Media Rotation Program for those dedicated media spaces.\u201d",
      "In a statement, NBC News said, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we\u2019ve used for many decades. Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.\u201d",
      "The move by Pentagon officials comes seven days after the Senate confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth by the narrowest of margins. It followed weeks of coverage about his behavior and treatment of women, including allegations that his alcohol consumption alarmed colleagues and his second wife feared for her safety around him. Hegseth has denied the allegations.",
      "NBC News reported on some of the allegations against Hegseth.",
      "The memo identified the rotating organizations by medium \u2014 selecting one each from TV, print, radio and online news to swap in and out. It said the news organizations rotating out had two weeks to vacate their spaces.",
      "The new outlets rotating in\u00a0are One America News Network \u2014 which will take NBC News\u2019s spot \u2014 the New York Post, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost.",
      "Three of the new outlets are conservative, while HuffPost leans progressive.",
      "HuffPost does not have a Pentagon correspondent, and the site did not request a space, spokesperson Lizzie Grams said.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump administration and Secretary Hegseth are interested in more hard-hitting coverage of their stewardship of the Defense Department from HuffPost, we are ready to deliver,\u201d Grams said.",
      "A One America News spokesperson said in a statement that the news outlet has operated a bureau in Washington since 2013, and it \u201clooks forward to having access to physical office space at the Pentagon and will utilize the accommodations full-time as soon as it\u2019s available.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the other news outlets for comment.",
      "The memo did not include further details about the process of the new \u201crotation program,\u201d including how officials chose which outlets needed to vacate office space first, how the new outlets were chosen and which are next, and how long an outlet would remain without an office space before it was rotated back into the building.",
      "NBC News has held its dedicated Pentagon workspace for decades, enabling the network to broadcast its journalism throughout the day and within minutes of breaking news. The \u201cbooth,\u201d as they are called, is hardwired with technical equipment, phone lines and a camera installed by NBC.",
      "It is unclear whether NBC News will have the technical capability to broadcast from the Pentagon once it clears out its equipment from its workspace.",
      "Ullyot noted that the vacating outlets continue to be members of the Pentagon press corps, meaning, in part, they \u201cwill be able to attend and cover briefings and be considered for travel with civilian and military leaders in the Department as they have previously.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon Press Association on Friday evening issued a statement\u00a0saying, \u201cOur resident press corps has greatly expanded over the years and we have always welcomed new members and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are, however, greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media who have covered the Pentagon for decades, under both Republican and Democratic administrations,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe have asked for a meeting and we will keep everyone informed.\u201d",
      "At her first press briefing this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was \u201copening up the briefing room to new media voices.\u201d The first people she called on were Mike Allen of Axios \u2014 a longtime political journalist at a site considered mainstream \u2014 and Matt Boyle of Breitbart, a conservative site.",

      "\u201cI play a buoy who is living in an icy ocean after humans no longer exist, and she\u2019s kind of hearing the echo of that loss and exhibiting it, but not really able to be it,\u201d Stewart explains. \u201cSo she ... desperately looks around and tries to find connection with the only other thing around her, which is this satellite.\u201d",
      "Buoy forms a \u201cnot-so-real personality\u201d in order to be looked at and liked, Stewart adds. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t feel too separate from what it feels like to try to get to know yourself to the extent that someone might like you.\u201d",
      "Stewart likens her character to a baby who has the whole internet at their fingertips, \u201cAnd all I want is to just hang out with one person. How do I make that happen?\u201d",
      "\u201cThen she tells a few lies, and then really regrets it, but then realizes that there was a lot of truth in those lies,\u201d she explains.",
      "As for Yeun, he tells TODAY.com that Satellite, Iam, is just serving a function until he meets Buoy \u201cand then all of a sudden, he becomes conscious of himself, and he\u2019s wanting to be defined.\u201d",
      "Once he\u2019s defined, Yeun says his character attempts to understand what that means. He eventually discovers that he would never have been able to define himself if it wasn\u2019t for Buoy\u2019s help. \u201cAnd so (his) journey was a mirror of her journey.\u201d",
      "What happens at the end of 'Love Me'?",
      "Andy Zuchero explains that the movie starts with humankind\u2019s extinction \u2014\u00a0\u201cThough we don\u2019t actually reveal why, we\u2019ll just say simultaneous crises.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the movie ends with our rebirth through these two new beings, and the fact that they \u2018have all the time in the world\u2019 means that they\u2019ll continue to evolve as we\u2019ve evolved over 200,000 years, and the Earth has evolved for 5 billion,\u201d he says.",
      "Stewart, on her end, feels that at the end Buoy and Satellite have a \u201cbreathy moment\u201d where they get to relax. And with the passage of time, they will \u201ccreate a situation\u201d where they have to keep communicating and growing.",
      "\u201cIt gets to the point at the end where they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, what should we order for dinner?\u2019 Which is kind of where we all want to get,\u201d she says, questioning what being in a good relationship looks like.",
      "As for Yeun, he brings up a quote his son Jude has been repeating: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the wind blows.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou look at the world right now and there\u2019s a lot of stuff happening, and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be abject suffering, (it could be good).\u201d",
      "What is the message behind 'Love Me'?",
      "Ultimately, Sam Zuchero says \u201cLove Me\u201d is a love story about transformation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being whatever you want to be, and not being stuck in the static, individualized state,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd not worrying about your brand itself, but just looking inward and trying to find what makes you happy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Charli XCX is set to perform at the 2025 Grammy Awards on Feb. 2, but gracing the Grammys stage is a moment the singer has been thinking about for much, much longer.",
      "The 32-year-old pop star received her first solo Grammy nominations last year, scoring eight nominations tied to her album \"Brat,\" including album of the year and record of the year.",
      "The nominations come more than a decade after the release of her debut studio album in 2013, and 10 years after she received two nominations for her feature on Iggy Azalea's hit song, \"Fancy.\"",
      "Charli XCX has questioned her lack of mainstream success over the years, especially after the release of her 2022 album, \"Crash,\" which became her first album to top the U.K. chart, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S. \u2014 her highest charting album at the time.",
      "\"me not being nominated for a grammy for crash is like mia goth not being nominated for an oscar for pearl and only further proves that people don\u2019t wanna see hot evil girls thrive,\" Charli XCX wrote in a post on X in 2023.",
      "It was \"Brat,\" Charli XCX's neon green club record released on June 7, 2024, that finally brought the singer into the mainstream, as her longtime supporters (angels) and newfound fans (brats) came together to make \"brat summer\" inescapable in 2024. The record debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, becoming her highest charting album of all time.",
      "The Grammys announced Charli XCX would be performing at the awards ceremony at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Feb. 2, though no further details about her performance have been revealed.",
      "In one song from \"Brat,\" the singer imagined an eventful night out at Staples Center, the former name of Crypto.com Arena and the location of more than 20 Grammy Awards ceremonies since 2000.",
      "'Spring Breakers' and the Grammys",
      "On \"Spring Breakers,\" the last track on the deluxe version of \"Brat,\" Charli XCX sings about going \"spring breakers,\" a tongue-in-cheek reference to the 2012 film starring Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson as a group of college students attempting to take a spring break trip in Florida.",
      "The film was widely panned after its release and has a 38% audience score rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Charli XCX's own 2016 \"Vroom Vroom\" EP was compared to the film in a review published by Pitchfork, which gave her EP a 4.5 out of 10 rating.",
      "\"'Spring Breakers'\u00a0is a good litmus test here: If you were a fan of Harmony Korine\u2019s 2012 exploitation flick, you\u2019ll probably love the intentional shallowness and plasticky transgression of\u00a0'Vroom Vroom,'\" the review states. \"If (like me) you would have walked out had you not spent $18 on a ticket, you\u2019ll probably hate it.\"",
      "In another reference to the film, the backing beat of Charli XCX's \"Spring Breakers\" samples \"Everytime\" by Britney Spears, which plays at a pivotal scene in the movie.",
      "In the first lines of her song \"Spring Breakers,\" Charli XCX seemingly alludes to her lack of nominations and invitations to awards shows.",
      "\"Hi, it\u2019s me, you\u2019re all in danger/ Never get invited \u2018cause I\u2019m such a hater,\" she sings, before warning she has her finger on a detonator.",
      "\"Every time, I make it so outrageous/ Always gonna lose to people playin\u2019 safer,\" she says in the song. \"Four, three, two, one, see you later/ Crazy girl s---, gonna go spring breakers.\"",
      "In the first verse of the song, Charli XCX details how she would arrive at the ceremony, parked outside watching the nominees walk the carpet.",
      "\"Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, in a big pink truck/ February 10th, and I\u2019m gonna pull up,\" she says, in a reference to her hit song \"Vroom Vroom,\" as well as the exact date of Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2008, 2013 and 2019.",
      "\"Hey, Staples Center, what the f--- is up?/ Y\u0435ah, I\u2019m parked outside watching all the girls strut,\" she continues, referencing the former name of Crypto.com Arena.",
      "In the next few lines, the song takes a dramatic turn, as she warns the nominees not to slip on the red carpet, because she \"poured a load of gasoline on the carpet.\"",
      "\"Lit a cigarette, took a drag, then I just flicked it/ Place went boom, boom, boom, boom, clap,\" she sings, in reference to another one of her hit songs, \"Boom Clap.\"",
      "\"Who cares? Just put me on the platform, turn the microphone on/ There\u2019s no one I wanna thank out there, yeah,\" she sings, before the chorus starts up.",

      "The Grammys will be held Sunday, Feb. 2, in Los Angeles, while the Chiefs and Eagles don\u2019t play until Sunday, Feb. 9, in New Orleans. That means Kelce, who last played in the AFC championship on Jan. 26 in Kansas City, doesn\u2019t have a game on Grammys weekend.",
      "However, the Chiefs are scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on Feb. 2 or Feb. 3, according to the team media schedule. Plus, Super Bowl opening night \u2014 at which Kelce and other players will be expected to speak to the media \u2014\u00a0will be in full swing Monday, Feb. 3, making it difficult for Kelce to potentially attend music's biggest night.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",

      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",

      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",

      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\""

And you\u2019re a mom and a wife, and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing this, but I just want to affirm you and say that being authentic is lonely. And I can imagine you feel that way sometimes, but I just love you and I appreciate you and I admire you so much.\u201d",

Her mother, Dorothy Larson, was born in 1933 in rural Pennsylvania in extreme poverty. Dorothy Larson's parents, Stone's grandparents, could only afford a two-room house for their five children.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time or moments to even think about was there anybody before them; there wasn\u2019t the luxury of imagining \u2018who were your ancestors,\u201d Stone explained to Gates. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to know who your people are. It\u2019s really nice to be able to find that out.\u201d",
      "Larson grew up surrounded in tragedy, with her twin dying at birth due to malnourishment and one of her sisters being struck and killed by a drunk driver, according to Stone. She also grew up with rickets and scurvy, and at age 9 moved in with their local dentist to live as their maid.",
      "Stone's third great-grandfather on her mom's side, George Greggs, also suffered from great hardship. A Pennsylvania Union cavalry soldier in the Civil War and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, Greggs potentially suffered from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder in the later stages of his life.",
      "With hardship on her mother's side, Stone's dad's upbringing also had unfortunate circumstances. Sharon's grandfather, Joseph Stone, managed a lucrative oil well that passed from heart disease, leaving his wife with no inheritance.",
      "Stone explained she believes she inherited her father's work ethic, who was a tool and dye maker. Stone herself battled career challenges herself, including a bounceback from a life-threatening stroke.",
      "\"It's so grounding to find out for the good and the bad of it,\" Stone explained when learning about her family lineage. \"Because them, you can just see yourself and go 'Oh, that's what I'm made of!'\""

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 15:05:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Inside the Auschwitz, Soviet soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people.",
    "story": [
      "O\u015aWI\u0118CIM, Poland \u2014 The Soviet Red Army troops who arrived here on Jan. 27, 1945, helped uncover one of the greatest atrocities ever committed by \u2014 and against \u2014 humankind.",
      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",
      "\u201cI think it is not taught enough in school in America, and if you watch the news in America now, you see the philosophies that people are following now and they are happy to pretend that this never happened,\u201d Sesar said.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",
      "In a video interview last week, Krell described his liberation as his \u201csecond birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the light again in front of me,\u201d Krell said. \u201cMy second birthday is more important, really, than the first. We always celebrate it: Aron Krell has two birthdays.\u201d",
      "Jesse Kirsch reported from O\u015bwi\u0119cim and Daniel Arkin from New York."

    "title": "Europe braces for 'most extreme' military scenario as Trump-Putin 2.0 begins",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Some European governments are afraid that Putin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. They worry President-elect Trump may not help if Russia attacks.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 All over Europe, there are signs of a continent steeling itself for the unthinkable.",
      "Lithuania plans to lay mines on its bridges to Russia, ready to detonate should Kremlin tanks try to cross. In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0envoy\u00a0Richard Grenell said on Friday he was headed back to the United States with six American citizens, a surprise development after he met with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas.",
      "Officials from the Trump administration had said earlier on Friday that one of Grenell\u2019s top aims for the visit was to secure the release of Americans detained in the country, at a time when the Trump administration has been driving a deportation and anti-gang push in the United States.",
      "Grenell did not name the six men, shown with him aboard an airplane in a photo he posted online. They were dressed in light blue outfits used by the Venezuelan prison system.",
      "\u201cWe are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\u201d Grenell posted on X. \u201cThey just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn\u2019t stop thanking him.\u201d",
      "Trump cheered the move in his own post, saying Grenell was bringing \u201csix hostages home from Venezuela.\u201d",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Americans were being held by Venezuela, but Venezuelan officials have spoken publicly of at least nine.",
      "Maduro\u2019s officials have accused most of them of terrorism and said some were high-level \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The Venezuelan government regularly accuses members of the opposition and foreign detainees of conspiring with the U.S. to commit terrorism. U.S. officials have always denied any plots.",
      "\u201cAmerican hostages that are being held in Venezuela ... must be released immediately,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special\u00a0envoy\u00a0for Latin America, said earlier on Friday, adding the Grenell-Maduro meeting was \u201cnot a negotiation in exchange for anything.\u201d",
      "In late 2023, Venezuela\u2019s government released\u00a0dozens of prisoners, including 10 Americans, after months of negotiations, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro.",
      "Maduro told officials in an annual speech to the judiciary late on Friday evening that the meeting between him and Grenell had been positive.",
      "\u201cThere are things where we\u2019ve reached initial deals and when they are complied with, new issues will open, hopefully new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,\u201d Maduro said, adding he would be looking to see if what had been discussed with Grenell was reflected in what is communicated by the U.S. about the meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe would like it to continue.\u201d",
      "Maduro and Grenell also discussed migration and sanctions at the presidential palace, the Venezuelan government said in a statement earlier on Friday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier on Friday that Grenell was also focused on ensuring 400 members of the Tren de Aragua gang in U.S. custody are returned to Venezuela.",
      "An agreement on Tren de Aragua deportations was \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab said last week that the gang had been dismantled in Venezuela in 2023, but that it was willing to restart legal cooperation with the U.S. in order to extradite gang members.",
      "Since taking power on Jan. 20, Trump has kicked off a\u00a0sweeping immigration crackdown, pledging mass deportations.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States were eligible for deportation reprieves granted by the previous administration, but U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would cut the duration of the protections. She must\u00a0decide by Saturday\u00a0whether to terminate them.",
      "Grenell\u2019s visit does not mean the United States recognizes Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, Leavitt said.",
      "The two countries have a fraught recent history marked by broken relations, sanctions and accusations of coup-plotting.",
      "But they share interest in several\u00a0pending bilateral issues, including a license allowing U.S. oil major Chevron\u00a0to operate in Venezuela.",
      "The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated broad oil sanctions after it said Maduro failed to keep promises for a free presidential election and later\u00a0increased rewards\u00a0for the capture or conviction of leaders including Maduro, leaving Trump limited options for further penalties.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government-backed victory in the July 2024 vote is contested by the opposition, international observers and numerous countries, including the United States.",

    "title": "Trump to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on Saturday, White House says",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 19:57:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
    "story": [
      "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
      "Trump had said he would issue those tariffs on the first day of his presidency, then said on Inauguration Day that the tariffs would be put in place on Feb. 1. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that Trump would carry through on that Feb. 1 deadline.",
      "Trump said Friday that there was nothing that the three countries could do to avoid the tariffs, which he said were in response to the import of fentanyl into the U.S. and because the U.S. has a trade deficit with the three countries. The U.S. is considered to have a trade deficit with those countries because it buys more goods and services from them than it sells to them.",
      "The tariffs could increase how much U.S. consumers and businesses pay for goods coming from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 including electronics, toys, shoes, fresh produce, lumber and cars. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "Trump also said he would be putting tariffs on oil and gas imports in the next several weeks as well as on computer chips, steel and aluminum, but didn't provide any details. In addition, he said he would be putting a \"tariff wall\" around pharmaceuticals to bring the industry back to the U.S.",
      "\"It'll be a tremendous amount of money for our country, tremendous amount, these are big numbers,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"And in addition to that, and you see the power of the tariff, I mean, the tariff is good, and nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank.\"",
      "When asked about the impact tariffs will have on inflation, Leavitt cited relatively low inflation during Trump's first term when he placed tariffs on billions of Chinese goods.",
      "\"President Trump is going to do everything he possibly can to cut the inflation crisis that the previous administration imposed on the American people, and he will continue to effectively utilize tariffs,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Tariffs during Trump's first term were more limited in scope than the current proposal and included a long list of exemptions and delays for certain products and industries. Economists have found those tariffs drove up prices for some imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments as a result of higher costs companies had to pay to import materials and parts.",
      "Mexico and Canada have threatened to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. imports, which could hurt American businesses that sell to those countries, like oil producers, farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that he was meeting with U.S. and Canadian officials to try to prevent the tariffs from being put in place, but that Canada was prepared to respond if tariffs were enacted.",
      "\u201cIf the President does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we\u2019re ready with a response. A purposeful, forceful, but reasonable immediate response,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. \"We won\u2019t relent until tariffs are removed and, of course, everything is on the table.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, China placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture products, and nearly all the revenue collected by the U.S. from the tariffs on China went to payments to American farmers to offset their losses from those Chinese tariffs.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to the tariffs on Mexico and Canada. For decades, its supply chains have been heavily intertwined with America\u2019s neighbors to the north and south. As vehicles and components cross borders multiple times during the production process, repeated 25% levies could quickly drive up vehicle costs.",
      "The U.S. also depends on agricultural products from Mexico, one of the top suppliers of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years \u2014 an issue Trump hammered on the campaign trail.",
      "The tariffs on Canada could also drive up prices of oil imported from Canada and Canadian lumber,  which could drive up the cost of new homes and other construction projects.",

      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued an expanded waiver to the sweeping freeze of U.S. foreign aid to include all life-saving assistance, but so far the exemptions to the executive order have not slowed the cuts to the USAID workforce.",
      "\"We have this thing that I\u2019ve called the foreign aid industrial complex: All of these entities around the world that are getting millions and millions of dollars from the United States,\u201d Rubio said in an interview Thursday with Megyn Kelly. \u201cWe have to make sure that it\u2019s aligned with our national interest, that we are prioritizing that and that we\u2019re spending it on things that really matter and are really producing.\u201d",
      "A former USAID official, Jeremy\u00a0Konyndyk, warned that the damage caused by the cuts to both the U.S. funding of aid groups and the staff of the development world cannot be easily reversed.",

    "story": [
      "Germany\u2019s opposition conservatives won parliamentary approval on Wednesday for a proposal to drastically restrict migration with the help of votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right.",
      "The proposal is non-binding but the role of the\u00a0AfD\u00a0in passing them is symbolically important in Germany, which faces a national election on Feb. 23 in which the far-right party is tipped to emerge as the second largest after the conservatives.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, is keen to seize the initiative on migration policy, which has shifted sharply back into focus after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested over\u00a0deadly stabbings\u00a0last week.",
      "Merz presented two non-binding motions\u00a0in parliament calling for heightened security measures and the closure of German land borders to irregular migration,\u00a0prompting hours of emotionally charged debate in the Bundestag lower house.",
      "With Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens opposed to the motions, however, Merz\u00a0knew he would have\u00a0to rely on support of the\u00a0AfD.\u00a0The land border measure passed with a slim majority of just three votes, while the security proposal was rejected.",
      "Critics\u00a0including Scholz\u00a0argue that\u00a0Merz\u2019s tactics\u00a0shatter the taboo among mainstream parties\u00a0against\u00a0working with the\u00a0AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a party that is monitored by German security services on suspicion of being right-wing extremist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in an effort to keep it from power.",
      "\u201cSince the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats: We do not make common cause with the extreme right,\u201d Scholz\u00a0said\u00a0in a speech to parliament.",
      "\u201cYou have broken this basic consensus of our republic in the heat of the moment,\u201d he told Merz.",
      "Scholz warned of a possible future coalition between the conservatives and the\u00a0AfD\u00a0after the election, even though Merz\u2019s party currently rules out such a scenario.",
      "Germany\u2019s Catholic and Protestant churches warned in a letter to parliament that cooperating with the far-right damaged the country\u2019s democracy \u2014\u00a0a rebuke\u00a0likely to sting Merz\u2019s Christian Democrats whose name evokes their religious links.",
      "Abdassamad El Yazidi, head of the Central Council of Muslims, accused politicians of \u201cchasing the positions of the far-right on immigration\u201d.",
      "\u201cGroups with migrant backgrounds are being stigmatized. It\u2019s not just immoral but dangerous to social cohesion in our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Merz\u2019s move is likely to make coalition building after the election much trickier. Some senior SPD and Greens politicians said he had proven himself unfit to govern.",
      "Merz, who aims to present a draft bill furthering the migration crackdown on Friday,\u00a0defended Wednesday\u2019s motions by saying\u00a0a decision was not wrong just because the \u201cwrong people\u201d supported it although it pained him to have to rely on the support of the\u00a0AfD.",
      "Merz has accused the SPD and Greens of blocking what he calls a necessary turnaround in asylum policy after the arrival in recent years of millions of asylum seekers fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine.",
      "The number of asylum seekers has dropped since Scholz\u2019s government pushed through a series of laws cracking down on migration in recent years and implemented more controls on the borders \u2014 but not enough, says Merz.",
      "Political analysts say that by\u00a0weakening the so-called firewall around the\u00a0AfD,\u00a0Merz\u00a0risks legitimizing the\u00a0far-right party\u00a0while scaring off centrist conservative voters.",
      "Support for the CDU/CSU dropped three points in the days after Merz promised a migration crackdown to 28%, according to a survey by\u00a0pollster Forsa\u00a0published on Tuesday. Scholz\u2019s SPD gained two points to 17%, as did the\u00a0AfD, to 21%.",
      "The\u00a0AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, accused mainstream parties on Wednesday of disrespecting German voters\u00a0in their treatment of her party.",
      "\u201cThe so-called firewall is nothing more than an anti-democratic cartel agreement... (that aims) to exclude millions of voters,\u201d she said during the debate in the Bundestag."

    "summary": "Syria\u2019s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa was declared transitional president Wednesday, less than two months after he led a campaign that toppled Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syria\u2019s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, was declared president for a transitional phase on Wednesday, tightening his hold on power less than two months after he led a campaign that toppled Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Sharaa was also empowered to form a temporary legislative council for a transitional period and the\u00a0Syrian constitution was suspended, according to an announcement made by the military command, which led the offensive against Assad.",
      "The decisions emerged from a meeting of military commanders who took part in the assault, a campaign spearheaded by Sharaa\u2019s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group \u2014 a former Al Qaeda affiliate.",
      "Addressing the conference, Sharaa said the first priority in\u00a0Syria\u00a0was to fill a vacuum in government \u201cin a legitimate and legal way.\u201d",
      "He also said civil peace must be preserved through transitional justice and preventing displays of revenge, that state institutions \u2014 foremost among them military and security forces \u2014 be rebuilt, and that economic infrastructure be developed.",
      "Sharaa has pledged to embark on a political transition including a national conference, an inclusive government, and eventual elections, which he has said could take up to four years to hold.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement did not say when the new legislative body might be picked or provide any new details for a timeline for the transition.",
      "Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said the declaration had \u201cformalized his status as the strongman ruler.\u201d \u201cMy take is that HTS and Sharaa intend to consolidate single-party Islamist rule.\u201d",
      "HTS emerged from the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in the\u00a0Syrian civil war, until it cut ties in 2016.",
      "The declaration announced that \u201cSharaa has assumed the presidency of the country in the transitional phase\u201d and would \u201ccarry out the duties of the presidency of the\u00a0Syrian Arab Republic, and represent it in international forums.\u201d",
      "The new legislative council would carry out its tasks until a new constitution is adopted. The parliament elected under Assad last year was formally dissolved.",
      "The declaration also reiterated previous steps dissolving Assad\u2019s Baath Party and his state security apparatus and said rebel groups that fought him during 13 years of war were to be dissolved and merged into the state.",
      "The announcements came at a meeting declared \u201cThe Conference for Announcing the Victory of the\u00a0Syrian Revolution.\u201d It was attended by ministers from the interim government appointed by HTS in December and was not publicly announced ahead of time.",
      "Qatar, which backs the new administration, issued a statement after the declaration welcoming \u201cmoves to restructure the\u00a0Syrian state and boost consensus and unity among all its parties.\u201d",
      "Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the announcement was a raw translation of Sharaa\u2019s newfound power and military control of great parts of\u00a0Syria\u00a0including the capital.\u201d",
      "It \u201cdoes not reflect the political, religious and ethnic diversity of\u00a0Syria,\u201d he added.",
      "Apparent celebratory gunfire could be heard in central Damascus soon after the announcements."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:03:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for Venezuelans was to continue through October 2026 but will now end in September of this year.",
    "story": [
      "Venezuelans in the U.S. will lose about one year of temporary protection from deportation outgoing President Joe Biden granted this month.",
      "On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled the latest extension of Temporary Protected Status issued by Biden, which allowed eligible Venezuelans to stay legally and work through Oct. 2, 2026.",
      "Venezuelans who have had TPS since March 11, 2024, will see it end on Sept. 10 of this year.",
      "Temporary Protected Status is granted to people already in the United States who are unable to return to their country because of conditions there, such as natural disasters or political upheaval.",
      "People with TPS are not eligible to get on a path to citizenship unless sponsored by an employer or family member. The protection usually is valid for several months and has to be renewed by the president, who usually consults with DHS and the Department of State about the country's conditions. If the protection is renewed by the president, TPS beneficiaries must reapply for it.",
      "About 600,000 Venezuelans were eligible for extended TPS in January, when Biden extended the protection.",
      "Venezuela has been in the throes of an economic, humanitarian and political crisis that has driven millions of its citizens out of the country, many desperate for basic necessities such as food and safety.",
      "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had said during the campaign that they might scale back TPS and its implementation in order to carry out the mass deportations Trump pledged to his supporters."

    "story": [
      "Hamas plans to release three Israeli hostages Thursday \u2014 two women and an 80-year-old man \u2014 as well as five Thai nationals abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.",
      "The Hostages Families Forum said it had received news that Hamas will release the eight abductees. The forum is a volunteer-based group the families of the abductees formed after the attack.",
      "Among those the militant group plans to release is Arbel Yehoud, 29, whom Israeli officials had expected to be freed last weekend in the first phase of the ceasefire deal, in which a total of 33 hostages are expected to be released.",
      "The two other Israelis expected to be released are Agam Berger, 20, and Gadi Moses, 80.",
      "Berger was working as an observer at Nahal Oz base, where she arrived just two days prior to the Oct. 7 attack, and was captured alongside multiple other observers who have since been released.",
      "Moses was living at kibbutz Nir Oz, where he was one of the founding members of the kibbutz's vineyard and gave lectures on agriculture. His partner was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, the hostage organization said.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, 30 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been released for civilian hostages and 50 for captive soldiers.",
      "The truce between Israel and Hamas was put in jeopardy Saturday after Israel blocked Palestinian civilians from moving back to their homes in northern Gaza. Israeli officials said that Hamas had violated the ceasefire agreement because it had failed to release Yehoud, a civilian, before captive soldiers.",
      "Hamas similarly accused Israel of breaking the deal, fueling concerns that a ceasefire that has brought a pause to 15 months of deadly fighting in Gaza could be imperiled.",
      "But on Monday, Qatar, a leading mediator in ceasefire negotiations, said that Yehoud would be freed along with two other hostages before Friday, soothing friction over the deal.",
      "Yehoud was kidnapped from her home in kibbutz Nir Oz, of which her grandparents were founders, along with her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, 27. The couple had just recently returned to Israel from a trip to South America.",
      "Yehoud's brother, Dolev Yehoud, 25, was also initially believed to have been taken hostage into Gaza, but in September, Israel determined that he had been killed by Hamas on the day of the attacks and that his body had never left Israeli territory.",
      "Cunio and his brother David, 34, remain held captive in Gaza, with neither expected to be released in the first phase of the deal.",
      "Specific details of the second phase of the deal has yet to be agreed upon, although a Middle Eastern official told NBC News on Monday that the second round of talks are likely to begin in Qatar next week.",
      "Three more captives are expected to be released Saturday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Many across Israel are hopeful Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage to remain in Hamas' captivity, will be among them.",
      "Kfir, now 2, was just under 9 months old when he was taken hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, along with his 5-year-old brother, Ariel, and their parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas.",
      "With 26 Israeli hostages still set to be released as part of the first phase of the ceasefire, a Middle Eastern official briefed on the matter told NBC News on Monday that Hamas has informed Israel that eight of the group are dead.",
      "A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later confirmed that these numbers matched information gleaned by Israeli intelligence.",
      "Hamas' disclosure was believed to be the first time the militant group has made clear how many hostages are dead or alive.",
      "Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and\u00a0Emily Damari, a\u00a0dual British citizen,\u00a0were the first three hostages to be freed by Hamas earlier this month in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, all women and children under the age of 19.",
      "Four female Israeli soldiers were later released Saturday in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, some of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks.",
      "Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage into Gaza in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli officials.",
      "In the more than 15 months since, more than 47,000 people in Gaza were killed in Israel's offensive, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Researchers estimate that the death toll is likely significantly higher because of difficulties in counting the dead amid the war and with thousands missing and feared dead under debris.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 29, 2025, 9:15 p.m. ET): A headline on a previous version of this article misstated that Arbel Yehoud had been released due to an editing error. She is expected to be released Friday; she has not yet been freed."
