    "summary": "Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump aren't new foes",
    "story": [
      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon said Monday that she is resigning after four years, the latest fallout at the network as its parent company considers settling a lawsuit with President Donald Trump over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with his former political opponent.",
      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",
      "McMahon has made clear she opposes settling with Trump \u2014 just like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who quit last month.",
      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",
      "McMahon, in her note, said that \u201cthe past few months have been challenging.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place, and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to the tussle with Trump, Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has expressed unhappiness over some network coverage of Israel's war in Gaza, including a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece this winter. Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",
      "That extra layer contributed to Owens' resignation. One of the show's correspondents, Scott Pelley, said on the air that \u201cnone of us is happy\u201d about the changes.",
      "CBS News is also trying to establish the new anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois at its flagship \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d broadcast amid ratings troubles.",
      "In his note to staff members, Cheeks praised McMahon for expanding local news at CBS stations and improving their competitive positions, along with improving the network's digital offerings.",

      "\u201cThis unique public-private partnership will enable us to bring our research-based curriculum to young children around the world with Netflix\u2019s global reach, while ensuring children in communities across the U.S. continue to have free access on public television to the \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 they love,\u201d Sesame Workshop said in its press release.",

      "Frederick Doe, 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.",
      "\u201cThose responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,\" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. \u201cYou foolishly agreed to assist.\u201d",

      "The toilet weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms). The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million pounds and it was insured for 4.74 million pounds.",
      "The piece that poked fun at excessive wealth had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "The theft of the toilet \u2014 which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold \u2014 caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.",

      "Doe, who was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property, was given a two-year suspended term and ordered to perform 240 hours of unpaid work.",

      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Denzel Washington sandwiched a whirlwind trip to the Cannes Film Festival, in between Broadway performances, for the premiere of Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d on Monday \u2014 and was rewarded with a surprise: an honorary Palme d'Or.",
      "Cannes had flipped around some of its scheduling to accommodate Washington's speedy France trip, which came on his lone off-day while performing \u201cOthello\u201d in New York. Cannes Film Festival chief Thierry Fr\u00e9maux surprised Washington with the award before the Monday night premiere.",

      "The festival usually gives out one or two honorary Palmes each edition \u2014 last year, the awardees were Studio Ghibli and George Lucas. Last week, Robert De Niro received one on the festival's opening night. De Niro's award was announced in advance, but surprise prizes aren't unheard of: In 2022, Tom Cruise was presented with a surprise honorary Palme d'Or just before the screening of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",
      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",
      "\u201cHe told me to tell you: Thank you for the love,\u201d Lee told the crowd after the screening. \u201cHe's on Broadway doing \u2018Othello,\u2019 so it really took a lot for him to fly here. Let's give it up for Denzel Washington, please.\u201d",
      "Lee also came to Cannes with obligations back in New York on his mind. He arrived at the film\u2019s premiere decked out in Knicks colors and wearing a blue and orange striped suit. Lee ended his brief speech in the Palais by hollering: \u201cNew York Knicks!\u201d",
      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d will be released in theaters by A24 on Aug. 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5.",

      "Gary Lineker, the former England soccer player and now a media celebrity, will step down from his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat",
      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",
      "Rats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.",
      "\u201cGary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\u201d BBC director-general Tim Davie said. \u201cAccordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\u201d",
      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",
      "In a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \u201cgenuine mistake\u201d and \u201cshould have been more diligent.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for it, and never should be.\u201d",
      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",
      "Lineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, \u201cGaza: How to Survive a War Zone,\u201d to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",
      "Lineker is one of England\u2019s greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram. He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",
      "\u201cMatch of the Day\u201d \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season. None of them are former soccer players.",

      "Its sixth installment, \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d drew big crowds to movie theaters this weekend and easily topped the domestic charts with $51 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. The movie earned the same internationally, adding up to a $102 million global debut.",
      "The same enthusiasm did not meet Abel \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d Tesfaye\u2019s experimental thriller \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d which opened outside of the top five with an estimated $3.3 million.",

      "\u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\u201d opened in 3,523 locations riding in on a wave of strong reviews (93% on Rotten Tomatoes) and viral marketing tactics, including a picture of logs on the back of trucks \u2014 a callback to one of the more infamous \u201cFinal Destination\u201d death traps.",
      "\u201cFinal Destination's\u201d win effectively revives a 25-year-old franchise that hasn\u2019t had a new film since 2011. It also continues a hot streak for Warner Bros., which has had near back-to-back hits in Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cA Minecraft Movie.\" All three were in the top five this weekend.",
      "Disney\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts\u201d landed in second with $16.5 million, pushing its global total to over $325 million. \u201cSinners\u201d placed third with $15.4 million, bringing its global total to $316.8 million. \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\" which has made $928.6 million globally, added $5.9 million. Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d rounded out the top five.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d opened in sixth place. The film, which Tesfaye co-wrote and Trey Edward Shults directed, is a kind of companion piece to his album and tour. He plays a fictionalized version of himself as an insomniac musician. Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan also star.",
      "Neither critics nor audiences greeted it kindly: It carries a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes and was slapped with a C- CinemaScore. AP music writer Maria Sherman wrote that it\u2019s \u201can exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate only handled the release of the R-rated film, which opened on over 2,000 screens and its $3.3 million was enough to make it a profitable deal for the studio.",
      "Next weekend could be a big one for movie theaters as \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning\u201d and the live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d both open nationwide. The overall domestic box office remains up nearly 15% from last year.",

The \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d puppets have been in our apartment in New York ever since we made the movie in boxes. Over the years, she takes them out and plays with them.",
      "ANDERSON: (Laughs) Jason, and Bill, have a way of catching you off guard with a turn of phrase. But I like that description. It\u2019s kind of an amazing experience to have had Jason involved in our movies for so long given that he was 17 when I met him. It\u2019s fun and a strange feeling. The decades have to elapse for you to have had that much time together. And it\u2019s quite shocking that they do. But there it is.",
      "ANDERSON: I didn\u2019t have something I thought I wanted to communicate about what it\u2019s like to be a father. The story really come out of an idea for Benicio and for this character. But I don\u2019t think he would have had a daughter if I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s my hunch. He\u2019s a special kind of a father, in all the worst ways. But nevertheless, there\u2019s something we related to. That\u2019s probably somewhere in the DNA of the movie.",
      "ANDERSON: If I were to say what is the first idea of the movie, it is that face. It\u2019s not an image of the setting, it\u2019s an image of Benicio in a close-up as this character. His face is just so expressive and interesting. It\u2019s a special advantage he has. He\u2019s quite mesmerizing just looking at him on camera, his chemistry with the exposure of film. In \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d there were electric moments on the set. But the electricity was amplified when we went back into the cutting room. The wheels started turning. When we showed \u201cThe French Dispatch\u201d however many years ago in Cannes, I did mention to Benicio there, \u201cJust be aware, there\u2019s something else coming.\"",
      "ANDERSON: Essentially, you\u2019ve put your finger on the movies that were written for a specific actor, along with Jason in \u201cAsteroid City.\u201d Owen and I were talking about Gene Hackman by the time we had 10 pages of a script. Ralph was the idea for the character in \u201cGrand Budapest\u201d before there was even one page. But I never had one where I thought of someone in such a tight close-up. With this movie, somehow it\u2019s the face and the eyes and the closest close-up.",
      "ANDERSON: First of all, Gene Hackman, one of the greatest movie actors ever. He did enjoy the movie, I think, between action and cut. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s when I have a good time.\u201d But he really didn\u2019t enjoy the parts in between, which is most of the time. He wasn\u2019t wildly taken with the script in the first place. I don\u2019t think he loved the idea of being that guy. I think he thought: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I don\u2019t like about this man and I\u2019m not sure I want to live as him.\u201d",
      "Also, I was very young. He was shy and reserved, though he could also get quite explosive. We didn\u2019t know each other well. Sometimes, when we had conflict, we often had open conversations about what just happened. And I felt like I learned so much about him in those times. And he would often become much more gentle.",
      "I don\u2019t want to assume a great friendship because I don\u2019t think he would have ever have referred to our relationship (laughs) in those terms. But I really liked him. He just carried so much tension and he used in the work, but it was sometimes bordering on a little abusive, especially to me. (Laughs)",
      "ANDERSON: I think that\u2019s the case sometimes. When he saw the movie, he told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what we were making.\u201d But he totally understood it when he saw the movie. It worked for him. He liked it, and I think he liked what he had done it. I later thought: I wish I had paused for three days of shooting, edited some of the scenes carefully and then shown him: Here\u2019s what you\u2019re doing and here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think maybe if I had done that, we might have had a gentler time.",
      "ANDERSON: The path that I\u2019ve had as a movie director, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally available right now. I don\u2019t know if the kind of movies I started out making would have been made on the same scale or with the same support or with any audience available. To get to the point where I can make the movies I make I now, I just don\u2019t know what route that would take. I think some things have changed fundamentally. But I\u2019m not 25 years younger than myself, so I just do what I do.",

      "MIAMI -- Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police early Saturday following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, according to the former NFL star and video posted to social media.",
      "Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene.",
      "The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved.",
      "Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter.",
      "Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer.",
      "Brown posted on social media that he had been \u201cjumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.\"",
      "\"Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,\u201d Brown wrote.",
      "Brown's statement did not mention the gunshots.",
      "Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL\u2019s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season.",
      "He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers\u2019 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",

      "A trio singing for Sweden about the joys of saunas and a classically trained Austrian countertenor are among those tipped to take the microphone-shaped Eurovision trophy at the contest in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "But at the ever-unpredictable event, the prize could just as easily go to powerful singers from France, the Netherlands or Finland \u2014 or even an Estonian who sings about Italian coffee. The final kicks off at 9 p.m. local time.",
      "Bookmakers say the favorite is KAJ, representing Sweden with their ode to sauna culture \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d followed by Austrian singer JJ\u2019s pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love.\u201d",

      "Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael has won many fans with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise,\u201d but also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",

      "\u201cIn the past it was about having a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English,\u201d he said. But in the past decade \u201cwe\u2019ve seen songs become much more socially and politically engaged, songs that present the audience with some sort of meaning.\"",
      "\u201cIn recent years the formulaic approach to a Eurovision entry hasn\u2019t succeeded,\" he added. \"An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days.\u201d",

      "Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden, where tensions spilled over backstage and Dutch competitor Joost Klein was expelled over an alleged altercation with a crew member.",
      "The European Broadcasting Union or EBU, which runs Eurovision, subsequently tightened the contest\u2019s code of conduct, calling on participants to respect Eurovision\u2019s values of \u201cuniversality, diversity, equality and inclusivity\u201d and its political neutrality.",
      "Performers say the backstage vibe this year is more relaxed.",
      "After a controversial ban in 2024 on flags, apart from national ones, being waved in the arena, this year audience members can bring Palestinian flags or any others, as long as they are legal under Swiss law. Performers, though, can only wave their own country\u2019s flag.",

      "Movies are a regular presence in author Kazuo Ishiguro's life in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Kazuo Ishiguro 's mother was in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped.",
      "When Ishiguro, the Nobel laureate and author of \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cNever Let Me Go,\u201d first undertook fiction writing in his 20s, his first novel, 1982's \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d was inspired by his mother's stories, and his own distance from them. Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but, when he was 5, moved to England with his family.",
      "\u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d marked the start to what's become one of the most lauded writing careers in contemporary literature. And, now, like most of Ishiguro's other novels, it's a movie, too.",
      "Kei Ishikawa's film by the same name premiered Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival in its Un Certain Regard section. The 70-year-old author has been here before; he was a member of the jury in 1994 that gave \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d the Palme d'Or. \u201cAt the time it was a surprise decision,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people booed.\u201d",
      "Ishiguro is a movie watcher and sometimes maker, too. He penned the 2022 Akira Kurosawa adaptation \u201cLiving.\u201d Movies are a regular presence in his life, in part because filmmakers keep wanting to turn his books into them. Taika Waititi is currently finishing a film of Ishiguro's most recent novel, \u201cKlara and the Sun\u201d (2021).",
      "Ishiguro likes to participate in early development of an adaptation, and then disappear, letting the filmmaker take over. Seeing \u201cA Pale View of Hills\u201d turned into an elegant, thoughtful drama is especially meaningful to him because the book, itself, deals with inheritance, and because it represents his beginning as a writer.",
      "\u201cThere was no sense that anyone else was going to reread this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in that sense, it\u2019s different to, say, the movie of \u2018Remains of the Day\u2019 or the movie of \u2018Never Let Me Go.\u2019\u201d",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited.",
      "ISHIGURO: Often people think I\u2019m being unduly modest when I say I want the film to be different to the book. I don\u2019t want it to be wildly different. But in order for the film to live, there has to be a reason why it\u2019s being made then, for the audience at that moment. Not 25 years ago, or 45 years ago, as in the case of this book. It has to be a personal artistic expression of something, not just a reproduction. Otherwise, it can end up like a tribute or an Elvis impersonation.",
      "Whenever I see adaptations of books not work, it\u2019s always because it\u2019s been too reverential. Sometimes it\u2019s laziness. People think: Everything is there in the book. The imagination isn\u2019t pushed to work. For every one of these things that\u2019s made it to the screen, there\u2019s been 10, 15 developments that I\u2019ve been personally involved with that fell by the wayside. I always try to get people to just move it on.",
      "ISHIGURO: You can take two kind of approaches. You write a novel and that\u2019s the discrete, perfect thing. Other people can pay homage to it but basically that\u2019s it. Or you can take another view that stories are things that just get passed around, down generations. Even though you think you wrote an original story, you\u2019ve put it together out of other stuff that\u2019s come before you. So it\u2019s part of that tradition.",
      "I said Homer but it could be folktales. The great stories are the ones that last and last and last. They turn up in different forms. It\u2019s because people can change and adapt them to their times and their culture that these stories are valuable. There was a time when people would sit around a fire and just tell each other these stories. You sit down with some anticipation: This guy is going to tell it in a slightly different way. What\u2019s he going to do? It\u2019s like if Keith Jarrett sits down and says he\u2019s going to play \u201cNight and Day.\u201d So when you go from book to film, that\u2019s a fireside moment. That way it has a chance of lasting, and I have a chance of turning into Homer.",
      "ISHIGURO: I\u2019ve got a few centuries to go.",
      "ISHIGURO: I was between the age of 24 and 26. It was published when I was 27. I remember the circumstances very vividly. I can even remember writing a lot of those scenes. My wife, Lorna, was my girlfriend back then. We were both postgraduate students. I wrote it on a table about this size, which was also where we would have our meals. When she came in at the end of the day, I had to pack up even if I was at the crucial point of some scene. It was no big deal. I was just doing something indulgent. There was no real sense I had a career or it would get published. So it\u2019s strange all these years later that she and I are here and attended this premiere in Cannes.",
      "ISHIGURO: I think that\u2019s really insightful what you just said. There is a limit to how much understanding there can be between generations. What\u2019s needed is a certain amount of generosity on both sides, to respect each other\u2019s generations and the difference in values. I think an understanding that the world was a really complicated place, and that often individuals can\u2019t hope to have perspective on the forces that are playing on them at the time. To actually understand that needs a generosity.",
      "ISHIGURO: I wasn\u2019t like a journalist trying to get stuff out of my mother. There's part of me that was quite reluctant to hear this stuff. On some level it was kind of embarrassing to think of my mother in such extreme circumstances. A lot of the things she told me weren\u2019t to do with the atomic bomb. Those weren\u2019t her most traumatic memories.",
      "My mother was a great oral storyteller. She would sometimes have a lunch date and do a whole version of a Shakespeare play by herself. That was my introduction to \u201cHamlet\u201d or things like that. She was keen to tell me but also wary of telling me. It was always a fraught thing. Having something formal \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m becoming a writer, I\u2019m going to write up something so these memories can be preserved\u201d \u2014 that made it easier.",
      "ISHIGURO: Someone said to me the other day, \u201cWe live in a time now where a lot of people would sympathize with the older, what you might call fascist views.\u201d It\u2019s not expressed overtly; the older teacher is saying it's tradition and patriotism.",
      "Now, maybe we live in a world where that\u2019s a good point, and that hadn\u2019t occurred to me. It\u2019s an example of: Yes, we write in a bubble and make movies in a kind of a bubble. But the power of stories is they have to go into different values.",
      "This question of how you pass stories on, this is one of the big challenges. You have to reexamine every scene. Some things that might have been a very safe assumption only a few years ago would not be because the value systems are changing around our books and films just as much as they\u2019re changing around us.",

      "CANNES, France -- You can get nostalgic about almost anything at the Cannes Film Festival, even Jerry Seinfeld on a zip line in a bumblebee costume.",
      "For many years, Cannes has played host not just to an endless stream of artistically ambitious movies, but also to some of Hollywood's most extreme promotional gambits. With so many films packed into the 12-day festival, and with much of the world watching, there are high stakes to standing out in Cannes.",
      "But in recent years, the Cannes marketing stunt has turned into an endangered species. Hopes that Tom Cruise might revive a dormant tradition passed with the relatively sedate premiere Wednesday of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "Would Cruise parachute into the Palais? Could he ride an airplane wing to the premiere? Nothing so elaborate came to pass. Cruise and company walked the red carpet while serenaded by an orchestra playing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme.",
      "Along the Croisette this year, there's a noticeable lack of the kind of grand advertisements Hollywood has often trotted out for the festival. Paramount Pictures has a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installation outside the Carlton Hotel, but \u2014 as has been true for several years \u2014 Hollywood rarely still seeks to make big marketing splashes in Cannes.",
      "Even though Universal Pictures' upcoming Formula One action drama \u201cF1\u201d might seem like a natural fit, with the Monaco Grand Prix just days away, \u201cF1\u201d \u2014 at least so far \u2014 has made no pit stop in Cannes.",
      "Things could change. Cannes runs until May 24. Someone might yet arrive by parasail over the Mediterranean, as T.J. Miller did in 2017 for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d or do ninja kicks with a troupe of giant pandas, as Jack Black did in 2008 for \u201cKung Fu Panda.\u201d",
      "But for years, the circus-like quality of Cannes has been in decline. That's owed partly to budgetary constraints and shifting marketing priorities for major studios. For Cruise and \u201cFinal Reckoning,\u201d Cannes was just one stop on a worldwide tour.",
      "Plus, some of those who were most devoted to bringing Hollywood entertainment to Cannes are no longer regulars here. While head of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg made sure his films left a mark in Cannes, whether with models wearing \u201cTrolls\u201d wigs or Seinfeld's \u201cBee Movie\u201d zip line.",
      "Is the absence of such things anything to lament? Probably not, but they did add to the crazy-things-will-happen nature of Cannes, giving the festival the feel of big tent extravaganza. It could be counted as one small, superficial way that movies aren't quite the carnivalesque show they once were.",
      "For now, though, we can say we'll always have when Sacha Baron Cohen, for \u201cThe Dictator,\u201d rode a camel down the Croisette. Ah, the memories.",

With more than 250 films to his name, many believed he would remain untouchable even after more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Now, that myth has cracked. The verdict has revived a broader question France has ducked since the dawn of #MeToo: Can a country that celebrates seduction and irreverence finally hold its male icons to account?",

Catherine Deneuve has defended \u201cthe freedom to bother,\" while Brigitte Bardot has dismissed feminism outright: \u201cFeminism isn\u2019t my thing. I like men.\u201d",
      "But the ground is shifting \u2014 fast.",
      "Depardieu was handed an 18-month suspended sentence Tuesday for groping two women on a 2021 film set. He denies the charges and is appealing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of impunity of artists with a capital A,\u201d Carine Durrieu Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the two women who won their case against Depardieu, told The Associated Press. The verdict represented \u201ca bookend for putting actors on a pedestal because they were talented,\u201d she added.",
      "Two days later, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival barred actor Th\u00e9o Navarro-Mussy \u2014 accused of rape by three former partners \u2014 from attending the premiere of a film he stars in. Though the file was dropped for lack of evidence, the women are relaunching their case as a civil complaint.",
      "Navarro-Mussy denies wrongdoing. His lawyer said she\u2019s unaware of any ongoing proceedings against him.",
      "What stunned wasn\u2019t just the decision, but who made it. Cannes director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux had long been seen as emblematic of the old guard. He defended Roman Polanski for years and continued to screen his films despite the director\u2019s 1977 guilty plea in the U.S. for sex with a 13-year-old. In 2018, when asked why Cannes still included Polanski, Fr\u00e9maux said: \u201cThese are complicated matters.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00e9maux opened 2023's festival with a film starring Johnny Depp, despite the actor\u2019s highly public legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over allegations of domestic abuse, in which he was never criminally charged. When asked about the backlash, Fr\u00e9maux replied: \u201cI only have one rule: it\u2019s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.\u201d",
      "This week, the rules changed.",
      "\u201cThe Cannes decision is of course linked to the Depardieu verdict,\u201d said C\u00e9line Piques of Osez le f\u00e9minisme (\u201cDare Feminism!\u201d), a group that campaigns against sexual violence. \u201c(They\u2019ve) realized which way the wind is blowing. Fr\u00e9maux is trying to right the wrongs.\u201d",
      "Not everyone welcomed the verdict \u2014 or what followed \u2014 as a cultural turning point.",
      "Fanny Ardant, one of French cinema\u2019s grandes dames and a longtime friend of Depardieu, sat on his side in court. She is now directing him in a film in Portugal, despite the conviction.",
      "\u201cFanny Ardant? She completely missed the point,\u201d said Piques. \u201cShe downplayed the violence, normalized it. That\u2019s rape culture, plain and simple.\u201d",
      "Juliette Binoche, Cannes jury president and one of France\u2019s most respected actresses, struck a note of restraint: \u201cHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a man \u2014 one who has, apparently, been desacralized.\u201d",
      "In 2024, more than 22,000 rapes were reported in France. Fewer than 3% led to convictions. \u201cThe Depardieu verdict shows there\u2019s progress,\u201d said lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens, who works with victims of sexual assault. \u201cBut for most women, the barriers to justice remain enormous.\u201d",
      "When Bertrand Cantat \u2014 frontman of Noir D\u00e9sir and once one of France\u2019s bestselling rock singers \u2014 launched a 2018 comeback tour, he had served just four years in prison for killing his partner, actress Marie Trintignant, during a violent assault.",
      "Despite public outrage, he returned to the stage and performed.",
      "\u201cThat would be unthinkable today,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThe public mood has changed. What we tolerate has changed.\u201d",
      "One breakthrough came not in cinema, but in a Bordeaux courtroom. The conviction of 51 men for drugging and raping Gisele Pelicot \u2014 a case long ignored despite her pleas \u2014 marked a turning point. For years, shame was hers. Now, it belongs to the perpetrators.",
      "\u201cIt proved rapists aren\u2019t just strangers in alleys,\u201d said Piques. \u201cThey\u2019re husbands. Colleagues. Respected men.\u201d",
      "Other recent convictions in entertainment included director Christophe Ruggia, who was convicted of abusing actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was a minor, though he is appealing; and actor-director Nicolas Bedos, who was sentenced for sexual assault.",
      "Slowly but surely, yes. The system that long protected men like Depardieu is not yet dismantled, but it is shifting.",
      "As one of the actor\u2019s accusers said through tears after the ruling: \u201cI\u2019m very, very much satisfied with the decision. That\u2019s a victory for me, really. And a big progress, a step forward. I feel justice was made.\u201d",

      "The 69th Eurovision Song Contest is approaching its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel",
      "BASEL, Switzerland -- There has already been triumph and tears, singing onstage and in the streets, and a touch of political division, as the 69th Eurovision Song Contest approaches its grand final in the Swiss city of Basel.",
      "Musical acts from 26 countries will take the stage at the St. Jakobshalle arena on Saturday in a spectacular, sequin-drenched competition that has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956.",
      "Here\u2019s everything to know:",
      "Eurovision is competition in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music or the World Cup with singing instead of soccer.",
      "It\u2019s a celebration of silly fun and music\u2019s unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s biggest cultural event,\u201d said Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision. \u201cIt has been going on for almost 70 years and people love to watch it, not only for the show, for the glitter, the stage effects, the crazy costumes, but also because they like to see it as a reflection of the zeitgeist in Europe.\u201d",
      "Of 37 countries that sent performers to Eurovision, 11 were knocked out by public voting in semifinals on Tuesday and Thursday. Another six automatically qualified for the final: the host, Switzerland, and the \u201cBig Five\u201d that pay the most to the contest \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.",
      "The 26 countries competing Saturday, in order of performance, are: Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia, Israel, Lithuania, Spain, Ukraine, the U.K, Austria, Iceland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Greece, Armenia, Switzerland, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, France, San Marino and Albania.",
      "Favorites, according to oddsmakers, are KAJ, representing Sweden with \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a jaunty serenade to the sauna. Dutch singer Claude is also highly rated with soulful ballad \u201cC\u2019est La Vie.\u201d Other favorites include classically trained Austrian countertenor JJ with his pop-opera song \u201cWasted Love,\u201d and Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, with her anthemic \u201cNew Day Will Rise.\u201d",
      "Eurovision has a reputation for campy europop with nonsense lyrics \u2014 past winners include \u201cLa, La, La\u201d and \u201cBoom Bang-a-Bang.\u201d But It has also produced some enduring pop classics. And it helped make stars of performers including ABBA \u2014 winners in 1974 with \u201cWaterloo\u201d \u2014 Celine Dion, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst and Italian rock band M\u00e5neskin.",
      "This year\u2019s finalists range from Lithuanian emo rockers Katarsis to a power ballad Spanish diva Melody and Ukrainian prog rockers Ziferblat.",
      "Campiness, humor and double entendres abound. \u201cEspresso Macchiato\u201d is a comic ode to Italian stereotypes performed by Estonia\u2019s Tommy Cash. Miriana Conte sings for Malta with the double entendre-filled \u201cServing\u201d -- performed on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips, it is classic Eurovision.",
      "It was once widely accepted that the most successful Eurovision songs were in English, but that is changing. This year\u2019s contest features songs in a record 20 languages, including Ukrainian, Icelandic, Latvian, Maltese and Armenian.",
      "Vuletic said viewers these days want \u201cmore authenticity in Eurovision entries.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want a standard pop song sung in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to also see something about the culture of the country that the song represents.\u201d",
      "Once all the acts have performed in the final, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build.",
      "Ending up with \u201cnul points,\u201d or zero, is considered a national humiliation.",
      "The final starts Saturday at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT) and will be aired by national broadcasters in participating nations, on streaming service Peacock in the United States and in many countries on the Eurovision YouTube channel.",
      "During and immediately after the final, viewers in participating countries can vote by phone, text message or the Eurovision app \u2014 but not for their own country. Viewers in the U.S. and other nonparticipating countries can vote all day Saturday, online at www.esc.vote or with the app. The combined \u201crest of the world\u201d vote is given the weight of one individual country.",
      "The contest\u2019s motto is \u201cunited by music,\u201d but the world\u2019s divisions inevitably intrude.",
      "Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and since then Ukrainian musicians \u2014 including 2022 winner Kalush Orchestra \u2014 have competed under the shadow of war in the home country.",
      "This year\u2019s contest has been roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel\u2019s participation. Dozens of former participants, including Nemo, have called for Israel to be excluded over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests have both taken place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year\u2019s event in Sweden.",
      "A handful of protesters attempted to disrupt a rehearsal by Israeli singer Raphael on Thursday with oversized flags and whistles and were escorted from the arena. Organizers say they have tightened security ahead of the final.",

      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- The man convicted of stabbing Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage in 2022, leaving the prizewinning author blind in one eye, is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.",
      "A jury found Hadi Matar, 27, guilty of attempted murder and assault in February.",
      "Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said he will request the maximum 25 years in prison for the Aug. 12, 2022, attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring a second man who was on stage with the author. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, he said.",
      "Rushdie is not expected to return to court for his assailant's sentencing, the prosecutor said. During the trial, the 77-year-old author was the key witness, describing how he believed he was dying when a masked attacker plunged a knife into his head and body more than a dozen times as he was being introduced at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about writer safety.",
      "Rushdie spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation center. The author of \u201cMidnight's Children,\u201d \u201cThe Moor\u2019s Last Sigh\" and \u201cVictory City\u201d detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, \u201cKnife.\u201d",
      "Matar next faces a federal trial on terrorism-related charges. While the first trial focused mostly on the details of the knife attack itself, the next one is expected to delve into the more complicated issue of motive.",
      "Authorities said Matar, a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out a decades-old fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target Rushdie at the summer retreat about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Matar believed the fatwa, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa after publication of Rushdie's novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. Rushdie spent years in hiding, but after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree he traveled freely over the past quarter century.",
      "Matar pleaded not guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with providing material to terrorists, attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah and engaging in terrorism transcending national boundaries.",
      "Video of the assault, captured by the venue's cameras and played at trial, show Matar approaching the seated Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a knife. As the audience gasps and screams, Rushdie is seen raising his arms and rising from his seat, walking and stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to separate them.",
      "Jurors in Matar's first trial delivered their verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.",

      "The Weeknd's first feature film is a surrealist vanity project, writes Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman",
      "NEW YORK -- It's the final night of tour. SoFi Stadium, just outside Los Angeles, is packed. 80,000 fans stand before The Weeknd, an endless sea of blinding lights. The bestselling artist born Abel Tesfaye emerges onstage. He launches into the first song. Less than a minute goes by, and the unthinkable happens: His voice cracks. And then it is gone.",
      "That September night in 2022 marked a turning point for Tesfaye. He mines the scene in \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow, \u201d where, ironically, it arrives too late. The tedium of an incoherent first act paints the charismatic performer \u2014 one of the last few decades' most popular \u2014 as an unempathetic protagonist in a nonlinear and nonsensical world.",
      "But how much of The Weeknd is here, really? In his first leading role in a feature film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, Tesfaye plays a fictionalized version of himself, an insomniac musician (as made explicitly clear in the \u201cWake Me Up\u201d leitmotif, where he sings, \u201cSun is never rising / I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s day or night\u201d). He's marred by a recent breakup from an ex portrayed in a cruel voicemail message (\u201cI used to think you were a good person,\u201d she says) and a hedonistic lifestyle, instigated by his superficial friend-manager Lee, played Barry Keoghan.",
      "Shortly after Tesfaye loses his voice, a psychosomatic ailment, he meets superfan Amina, portrayed by Jenna Ortega. She offers temporary comfort and, in return, is afforded no agency. She exists for him. Soon, the uninspired horrors begin, culminating in what recalls the torture scene in \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d with less violence. Instead, Amina \u2014 when she is not weeping; I urge all viewers to keep a \u201ccry count\u201d and consider what feminist blogs might have to say \u2014 lip-syncs some of The Weeknd's biggest hits back to him, explaining that they're all about \u201cemptiness and heartbreak.\u201d Woven throughout is some conversation about absent fathers and fear of abandonment, with unearned delivery and first-draft acuity \u2014 something gesturing at depth without piercing the surface.",
      "According to press materials, Amina and Lee are not real people but representations of Tesfaye. She is meant to represent Tesfaye's disconnected, \u201cdeeper emotional self\u201d \u2014 and Lee, his public persona. That is not made explicitly clear in the film, except in a very generous reading of the ending. Subtext only works when there is context to back it up, otherwise, you are left with \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d: an exciting vanity project with surrealist imagination but stiff writing, no stakes, limited emotional weight and an unclear narrative.",
      "That won't be an issue for superfans, of course \u2014 those intimately familiar with The Weeknd's music and career. This film appears to be for them and Tesfaye, a producer, alone; they have the framework in which to enjoy the runtime. Considering that fandom is the dominant form of popular culture, it's not a bad business decision.",
      "And it's worked for him before. This is not Tesfaye\u2019s first foray into acting. Aside from his cameo in \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d he starred in HBO\u2019s 2023 series \u201cThe Idol. \u201d He co-created the show with Sam Levinson, a show that similarly presented unearned provocation. At the time, \u201cThe Idol\u201d received criticism for its sadomasochistic storytelling that emerged after a shift away from \u201cthe female perspective,\u201d allegedly a request from Tesfaye. It was not a clever or subversive show, nor was it really even about anything, but it did inspire conversation. It's easy to see how \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d may have similar effects.",
      "In a moment where autobiographical films about musicians are playful and creative \u2014 Pharrell Williams' Lego partnership \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d comes to mind, as does Robbie Williams' \u201c Better Man \u201d \u2014 \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d feels like a misstep for those outside The Weeknd's most devoted. Of course, the film does not identify as a biopic. But it could've benefited from less self-seriousness. And editing.",
      "But what about the music? \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d is connected to Tesfaye's latest album of the same name \u2014 and the final chapter in The Weeknd\u2019s record-breaking trilogy that began with 2020\u2019s \u201cAfter Hours\u201d and continued with 2022\u2019s \u201cDawn FM.\u201d The album, the quietest of the series, worked as an allegory on the trials of fame \u2014 a topic long covered by the most successful purveyors of pop. Retrospectively, it works best as a film's soundtrack than a stand-alone record, ambitious. Like the movie, it gestures at criticism of the celebrity-industrial complex without accomplishing it. It seems obvious, now, to learn that the movie predates the record.",
      "The film's strength far and away is its score, composed by Tesfaye with Daniel Lopatin (better known as the experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never and for his \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cUncut Gems\u201d scores). It builds from Tesfaye's discography and morphs into something physical and psychedelic \u2014 at its most elated, dread-filled and clubby. It is so affecting, it almost distracts from moments of dizzying cinematography, with the films' penchant for spinning frames, zooms into upside skylines, blurred vision and erratic lights.",
      "Those tools feel better suited for a music video, the kind of sophisticated visual world Tesfaye has developed in his pop career. They elevate his euphoric, layered, evocative dance-pop, but they do not translate in this film.",
      "\u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d a Lionsgate release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, drug use, some bloody violence and brief nudity. Running time: 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

Bring yourself and your gratitude that you\u2019re a musician and they\u2019re allowing you into a festival that celebrates actors and storytellers of a different kind. I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll try to bring it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Besides, Cannes, he notes, was founded amid World War II as an alternative to then-Mussolini controlled Venice Film Festival. It was, he says, \u201cdesigned to find fascists.\u201d",
      "Shifts in geopolitical tectonics was much on Bono's mind. He has spent much of his activist life fighting for aid to Africa and combating HIV-AIDS. U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of USAID has reversed much of that.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s irrational is taking pleasure in the defacement of these institutions of mercy,\u201d Bono said.",
      "\u201cBono: Stories of Surrender,\u201d an Andrew Dominik-directed black-and-white film that begins streaming May 30, adapts the one-man stage show that, in turn, came from Bono's 2022 book, \u201cSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story.\u201d",
      "In the film, Bono is self-effacing and reflective, sifting through the formative influence of his father, U2's skyrocketing to fame and considering how ego and social work might be related. He calls it \u201cthe tall tales of a short rock star.\u201d And as was the case on a recent sunny afternoon in Cannes, Bono makes a captivating raconteur.",
      "Remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "BONO: Well, that\u2019s right. Globalization did very well for the world\u2019s poor. That and increased aid levels brought a billion people out of extreme poverty and halved childhood morality \u2014 remarkable jumps for quality of life for human beings.",
      "But it\u2019s also fair to say certain communities really paid the price for that \u2014 here in Europe, in the United States. And I\u2019m not sure those communities were credited enough for weathering storms that globalization brought. So I understand how we got to this place, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the right place to be in.",
      "Nationalism is not what we need. We grew up in a very charged atmosphere in Ireland. It makes you suspicious of nationalism and those animal spirits that can be drummed up. This is me speaking about surrender, \u201cStories of Surrender,\u201d at a time when the world has never been closer to a world war in my lifetime. At first I think it looks absurd, a bit ridiculous \u2014 now that has never stopped me in the past \u2014 but I think it\u2019s OK to look ridiculous for these ideas. Like surrender, nonviolence, peace.",
      "BONO: The new pope, he does look like a pope. That\u2019s a good start. I just saw the other day his first piece and he was talking about stopping shouting, God might prefer whispers. I thought, \u201cOh, this could be interesting.\u201d I\u2019m more of a shouter myself. I come from punk rock. But I\u2019m learning to turn that shout into a whisper in this film to get to an intimacy.",
      "BONO: Well, the accuracy of the put-down \u2014 \u201cYou are a baritone who thinks he\u2019s a tenor\u201d \u2014 is so all encompassing. I was going to call the play \u201cThe Baritone Who Thinks He\u2019s a Tenor.\u201d He\u2019s on my mind because he\u2019s the reason I sing.",
      "It\u2019s a wound that will never close because after playing him on stage for all those nights \u2014 just by turning left or right \u2014 I always loved him but I started to really like him. He started to make me laugh. There was a gift, as well as the voice, that he left me. Would he forgive me for impersonating him in the Teatro di San Carlo, a sacred place for tenors, probably not. But here I am impersonating an actor, so.",
      "BONO: Mission creep. I knew I had to write the book. The play was so I didn\u2019t have to tour the book in normal promotional activity, that I could actually have fun with it and play all the different characters in my life. I thought it was really good fun. Then I realized: Oh, there\u2019s parts of you that people don\u2019t know about. We don\u2019t go to U2 shows for belly laughs. But that\u2019s a part of who I am, which is the mischief as well as the melancholy.",
      "Then you end up doing a play with a lot of cameras in the way. Enter Andrew Dominik and he taught me something that I didn\u2019t really understand but my daughter does: The camera really knows when you\u2019re lying. So if want to tell this story, you better get ready to take your armor off. You\u2019re going to feel naked in front of the whole school, but that\u2019s what it takes.",
      "BONO: Based on my behavior just in the past week, the answer to that question is probably: Must try harder. The pilgrim\u2019s lack of progress. I would say that I understand a little better where I came from and that where I end up depends on how I deal with that.",
      "I\u2019ve been calling it the hall of mirrors, when you try to figure out who you are and who\u2019s behind the face. Then you just see all these faces staring back at you, and they\u2019re all true. The real star of this movie is my dad. I sort of like him better than I like myself because humor has become so important to me. It\u2019s not like everything needs to be a belly laugh, but there\u2019s a freedom. People like me, we can sing about freedom. It\u2019s much better to be it.",
      "BONO: There\u2019s a minister from Albania who said something that really stuck with me. She said: If you have a chance to hope, it\u2019s a moral duty because most people don\u2019t. So, yes, I feel we\u2019ll figure our way out of this. This is a scary moment.",
      "I think acknowledging that we can lose all we\u2019ve gained is sobering but it may be course-changing. I just believe in people enough. I believe in Americans enough. I\u2019m an Irish person, I can\u2019t tell people how to vote.",
      "I can tell you that a million children dying because their life support systems were pulled out of the wall, with glee, that\u2019s not the America that I recognize or understand. You\u2019re on the front lines of Europe here. America came in and saved the day. Ironically, so did Russia. More people died from Russia fighting the Nazis than everybody else. Now they tread on their own sacred memories by treading on the Ukrainians who also died on the front lines. I think part of that is that history didn\u2019t acknowledge it.",
      "I believe there is integrity in the Russian people. They need to change their leader, in my view. I believe there is integrity in the Americans. They will figure it out. Who was it who said: If you give Americans the facts, they will eventually make the right choice. Right now, they\u2019re not getting the facts. Think of it: a 70% decline in HIV-AIDS, Republican-led, Democratically followed though. The greatest health intervention in the history of medicine to fight HIV-AIDS has been thrown away. It was nearly there. To a space traveler, it\u2019s like getting to Mars and going, \u201cNah, we\u2019ll go back.\u201d It\u2019s bewildering to me.",

      "Hundreds of writers, editors and publishers have gathered for PEN America\u2019s annual gala hosted by Amber Ruffin and featuring a tribute to actor-publisher Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amber Ruffin looked out upon hundreds of writers, publishers and editors gathered for PEN America's annual gala and shared her experience of being on the receiving end of censorship.",
      "\u201cI'm officially a banned book,\u201d the comic-writer joked, referring to her being dropped as a speaker at April's White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cThey booked me and then they banned me.\u201d",
      "Thursday night's event at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City was a protest against the suppression of speech and a celebration of being permitted to say what you pleased.",
      "Ruffin presided over a dinner-fundraiser that included a tribute to actor-publisher-bibliophile Sarah Jessica Parker, imprisoned Egyptian poet-songwriter-activist Galal El-Behairy, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth and Macmillan CEO Jon Yaged.",
      "One of the biggest ovations was for a non-speaker, Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who during a White House meeting in February challenged President Donald Trump over her support for transgender athletes, When Trump suspended funds for a Maine child nutrition program, Mills sued in federal court and prevailed.",
      "PEN America, the century-old free speech organization, brought in Ruffin to host soon after the WHCA withdrew its invitation, contending it wanted to focus on the achievements of journalism. Ruffin is a blunt and sometimes profane critic of Trump and duly went after him Thursday, calling him \u201cgross,\" \u201cincompetent,\u201d \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexually deviant.\u201d She also praised PEN for the chance to speak out.",
      "\u201cThank you to PEN America for asking me to host and more importantly, thank you, PEN America, for Googling me at least once before asking me to host,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, White House Correspondents Association.\u201d",
      "Parker was presented the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, given in previous years to Patti Smith, Robert Caro and Stephen Sondheim among others.",
      "Parker has been a longtime champion of books and literacy and runs the publishing imprint SJP Lit, where authors include Lucy Caldwell, Linda Grant and Elysha Chang. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, she premiered a documentary film for which she served as executive producer, \u201cThe Librarians,\u201d about the fight against book bans.",
      "\u201cTo censor a book is to limit imagination, curiosity, connection, empathy and inspiration,\u201d Parker said during her acceptance speech. \"Libraries aren't just buildings with shelves. They are a beacon. They are warm in the winter and cool in summer, and they are sanctuaries of possibility. They are a heartbeat of the neighborhood.\"",
      "El-Behairy, who has been imprisoned off and on since 2018 on charges of terrorism and \u201cspreading false news,\u201d won the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, given to dissidents who have been jailed. The prize was accepted by his sister, Naiera, and father, Abdelfattah, who noted his son \"paid the price for his opposition with the best years of his life wasted in prison.\u201d",
      "Taye Diggs presented the Business Visionary award to Yaged and joked that he liked the Macmillan executive because he didn't publish his children's books just because Diggs was an extremely handsome and successful Black actor.",
      "Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth, a leading critic of Trump\u2019s threats to cancel research funding at Columbia University and other schools, won the PEN/Benenson Courage Award. During a speech that was loudly cheered, he remembered a happy, outspoken and admittedly privileged childhood during which threats to democracy were rarely considered.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have to draw on love and support if we are to resist the slide towards authoritarianism that has gathered momentum across the land,\" Roth said.",
      "PEN is still recovering from a tumultuous 2024. Allegations that leadership was reluctant to criticize Israel's invasion of Gaza and slow to respond to the suffering of Palestinians, including Palestinian writers and journalists, led to so many writers withdrawing from PEN's spring awards ceremony and World Voices festival that both were canceled. PEN CEO Suzanne Nossel departed at the end of the year and a permanent replacement has not yet been announced.",
      "The awards night and World Voices returned this month, although with reminders of the ongoing war in Gaza. Several prize nominees withdrew from competition, including two of the five finalists for the $75,000 Jean Stein Book Award for a work of \u201coriginality, merit, and impact.\u201d The daughters of Stein, the late author, editor and philanthropist, decided the prize money would be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund and to Palestine Legal, a U.S.-based defense organization.",

      "\u201cThere's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,\u201d Nebraska Gov.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators on Monday were combing through the writings of a 25-year-old man believed responsible for an explosion that ripped through a Southern California fertility clinic over the weekend.",
      "The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation Saturday that damaged the American Reproductive Centers building in Palm Springs, east of Los Angeles. Bartkus died in the explosion. None of the facility's embryos were damaged.",
      "Authorities called the attack terrorism and said Bartkus left behind nihilistic writings that indicated views against procreation, an idea known as anti-natalism.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The blast gutted the clinic and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Passersby described a loud boom, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along sidewalks of the upscale desert city.",
      "Bartkus' body was found near a charred vehicle.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office, called it possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",
      "The facility was closed for the day.",
      "\u201cThis was a targeted attack against the IVF facility,\u201d Davis said Sunday. \u201cMake no mistake: We are treating this, as I said yesterday, as an intentional act of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Authorities executed a search warrant in Bartkus' hometown of Twentynine Palms, a city of 28,000 residents northeast of Palm Springs with a large U.S. Marine Corps base.",
      "Bartkus tried to livestream the explosion, but the attempt failed, the FBI said.",
      "Authorities haven't shared specifics about the explosives used to make the bomb and where Bartkus may have obtained them.",
      "Scott Sweetow, a retired ATF explosives expert, said the amount of damage caused indicated that the suspect used a \u201chigh explosive\u201d similar to dynamite and TNT rather than a \u201clow explosive\u201d like gun powder.",
      "Those types of explosives are normally difficult for civilians to access, but increasingly people are finding ways to concoct explosives at home, he said.",
      "\u201cOnce you know the chemistry involved, it\u2019s pretty easy to get stuff,\u201d Sweetow said. \u201cThe ingredients you could get at a grocery store.\u201d",
      "The images of the aftermath also showed that the explosion appeared to blow from the street straight through the building and to the parking lot on the other side, something that could have been intentional or pure luck, Sweetow said. A part of the car was also blown through the building and landed in the back by a dumpster.",
      "Authorities are working to learn more about Bartkus\u2019 motives. They haven\u2019t said if he intended to kill himself in the attack or why he chose the specific facility.",
      "His writings communicated \u201cnihilistic ideations\u201d that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, said U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in the area. In general, nihilism suggests that life is meaningless.",
      "He appeared to hold anti-natalist views, which include a belief that it is morally wrong for people to bring children into the world. The clinic he attacked provides services to help people get pregnant, including in vitro fertilization and fertility evaluations.",
      "Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives \u201cand they diagnose society as suffering in a similar way that they are,\u201d said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cEssentially, they feel like we're all doomed, that it's all hopeless.\u201d",
      "That hopelessness is a way for attackers to rationalize their violent actions, Lankford said Monday.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s always on to the next fight,\u201d he said.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",

      "\u201cThe WHO faces an existential crisis that goes well beyond a budget gap to the question of whether this sort of multilateralism can succeed in addressing global health in this new era of nationalism and misinformation,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cLiterally millions will likely die needlessly on the current trajectory and the world\u2019s health ministers do not seem capable of a coherent response,\u201d Kavanagh added.",
      "On tap for the nine-day World Health Assembly are two major advances that are aimed to buttress WHO\u2019s financial strength and bolster the world\u2019s ability to cope with pandemics in the future.",
      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",
      "The treaty\u2019s effectiveness will face doubts when the U.S. \u2014 which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 is sitting out, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it, a common issue in international law.",
      "Kavanagh said passage of the treaty \u201ccould be a significant victory \u2014 evidence that the U.S. government may no longer be indispensable in global health\u201d and could offer an opportunity for developing nations in the \u201cglobal South\u201d over the longer term.",
      "In the run-up to the assembly, WHO has been cleaning house and cutting costs. Its management has presented a budget for the next two years at just under $4.3 billion, which is 22% less than originally planned \u2014 largely in response to Western funding cuts.",
      "At a meeting on its budget last week, Tedros \u2014 a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister \u2013 announced a shake-up of top management that included the exit of key adviser Dr. Michael Ryan from the job as emergencies chief.",
      "Tedros said last week that the loss of U.S. funds and other assistance have left the WHO with a salary gap of more than $500 million. WHO is \u201cconfident\u201d that it has commitments for 60% of funds for the next two-year budget cycle, but it faces a budget gap of $1.7 billion.",

      "Attention spans are shrinking, with research showing the average person's has declined from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to 47 seconds now",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

The military restricts their movements to a designated \u201csafe zone,\u201d which severely limits farming.",
      "For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.",

      "She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bury another child,\u201d she said.",
      "Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.",
      "He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.",
      "\u201cIt is very traumatic,\u201d said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. \u201cOne of the things is the threat to the lives of children.\u201d",
      "UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.",
      "Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.",
      "\u201cBefore the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,\u201d said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. \u201cNow my biggest worry is high mortality. We don\u2019t have enough resources to keep up.\u201d",
      "Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.",
      "The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.",
      "\u201cIt used to be far less,\u201d said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.",
      "The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.",
      "\u201cBefore, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,\u201d said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. \u201cNow, that has stopped.\u201d",
      "Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, \u201csadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.\u201d He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.",
      "The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.",
      "In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the needy, said Frederico Jo\u00e3o, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.",
      "More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inoc\u00eancio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.",

      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes toxic behavior at work and the kinds of treatment people won't tolerate for a steady paycheck",
      "NEW YORK -- One week into a new job, Lisa Grouette discovered something missing come Sunday night: the sinking feeling of dread she used to experience before going to work every Monday.",
      "Groutte spent 10 years at an insurance agency with a boss whom she alleges screamed at her, slammed his hands on the desk, insulted her appearance and punched things. He falsely accused her of taking money and threatened to withhold an employment recommendation if she quit, she says.",
      "Fearing she wouldn\u2019t land another job if she left the toxic workplace, she stayed. \u201cIt was this implied, \u2018You\u2019re stuck,'\" Grouette, 48, recalled.",
      "But eventually, she found a way out. When a full-time job opened up at a newspaper where she worked a part-time photography job, she resigned from the insurance agency. The new position paid $400 less per month, but Grouette reduced her expenses to make it work.",
      "\u201cYou can't put a price tag on it,\u201d she said. \"It was the best 400 bucks a month I've ever spent, worth every penny. I was a little tight at first, but it didn't matter because I was happy.\u201d",
      "As mental health awareness increases, so are conversations about about what constitutes unhealthy behavior and the kinds of treatment people will not \u2014 or should not \u2014 tolerate for a steady paycheck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re developing language now around things like toxic workplaces,\u201d said Jennifer Tosti-Kharas, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College in Massachusetts.",
      "Younger generations entering the workforce, including millennials and members of Generation Z, are less willing to endure bullying behavior from colleagues and managers, and better at establishing boundaries, she said.",
      "At the start of her own career, \u201cif I encountered toxicity in the workplace, I had more of a \u2018Suck it up\u2019 attitude,\" said Tosti-Kharas, who identifies as a member of Generation X. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were as vocal about taking care of our mental health as we should have been.\u201d",
      "Conflicts and difficult relationships may be inevitable in any work environment. But there's a difference between an occasional disagreement and persistent abuse.",
      "\u201cWhat makes something toxic: it\u2019s more pervasive, more consistent over time,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said. \u201cYou may have tried some things and it\u2019s not getting better. ... It\u2019s very deeply entrenched.\u201d",
      "Possible indications of an emotionally harmful workplace include a widespread lack of trust and fear of being shot down if you speak up, she said.",
      "Loud screamers aren't the only kind of toxic co-workers and supervisors. There are quieter forms of toxicity, such as passive-aggressive behavior by leaders who use sarcasm, backhanded compliments, indirect criticism and exclusion to control their employees, according to Alana Atchison, a clinical psychologist based in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt is a relationship where you can\u2019t communicate clearly or directly, so you have to silence yourself. You can\u2019t say truly what you need to say and feel safe,\u201d Atchison said.",
      "To spot a potentially toxic environment when applying for a new job, follow your gut instincts and consider warning signs. For example, frequent ads for the same position may reflect high turnover resulting from a negative environment. You can also search employee reviews online.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading Glassdoor reviews like crazy to see what the environment is like, what the culture is like, on anyplace I\u2019m applying to, because I can\u2019t lose my hair again over a job,\u201d said Grouette, who recently was laid off after several successful years at the newspaper.",
      "When on the receiving end of toxicity, consider whether the offending behavior says more about the person perpetuating it than the recipient.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smokescreen to hide their deficits,\u201d Atchison said. \u201cIf someone feels insecure about their role or fears being overshadowed, they might resort to undermining others, gossiping or sabotaging projects to regain a sense of control or safety.\u201d",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Atchison's clients have increasingly complained about toxic work environments. She attributes that in part to the social isolation that accompanied lockdowns and restrictions on public activities.",
      "\u201cSocializing is a skill set, and that skill set has declined,\" she said.",
      "If you find yourself in a toxic work situation, talking about it with a trusted friend or professional therapist can help you process what is happening and develop a plan to deal with it, instead of letting it fester in your mind.",
      "Stephanie Strausser, 42, a video production manager, said she sought support from friends and family members when she worked under an extreme micromanager who made her feel unsafe and whose decisions she considered unethical.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t hide it or keep it in. Talk to people. Even if you\u2019re talking to ChatGPT,\" Strausser advises those who find themselves in similar circumstances. \"Don\u2019t internalize it. And don\u2019t take someone\u2019s perception as fact.\u201d",
      "Amanda Szmuc, a Philadelphia lawyer who considers some of her past work environments to have been toxic, recommends documenting your concerns in case it becomes necessary to escalate them.",
      "Writing down the details of troubling interactions as they happen and keeping copies of inappropriate messages or approved meeting recordings may come in handy if the human resources department gets involved, for example.",
      "Maintaining a record may also help you avoid gaslighting and reinforce your determination to protect yourself.",
      "If leaving a toxic environment isn't financially possible or you want to try to make your circumstances more bearable, think about exploring ways to limit your interaction with the difficult party may be an option.",
      "Possibilities may include negotiating a role that puts distance between you and the toxic person, such as working different shifts or on different projects, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "You can also set deadlines for yourself to keep things from deteriorating, according to Szmuc. Examples: \u201cI\u2019m going to give this two weeks. Is there any improvement?\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a way internally where I can maybe change my circumstances or get someone else\u2019s opinion?\u201d",
      "Ideally, an employee who feels mistreated could appeal to someone from human resources or the offending employee's manager with evidence to show a pattern of conduct violations and disciplinary action would be taken, Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "But that doesn't always happen, leaving the reporting party in close proximity with the person they reported. \u201cIn the real world, you may realize they are unlikely to go anywhere, and it\u2019s you who has to go somewhere,\u201d Tosti-Kharas said.",
      "In extreme situations, it's best to look for another job, she said.",
      "If an inspector found radon in your house, \u201cyou wouldn't say, \u2018Let me try to work with the radon,\u2019 or \u2018How can I keep it there but maybe lessen the effects?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou would get the toxin out of the situation or you would get yourself out of the situation.\u201d",
      "Most people can't afford to leave their jobs without another one lined up. Carving out time to apply for different jobs is difficult when you feel under assault but also is empowering and may lead to a better situation.",
      "\u201cIf somebody gives you an impression that you\u2019re not able to leave this job, that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Grouette said. \u201cThose sorts of people don\u2019t have the reach or respect that they claim to have, because if they\u2019re volatile to you, they\u2019re volatile to others.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Missouri lawmakers have approved a referendum seeking to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months ago",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Six months after Missouri voters approved an abortion-rights amendment, Republican state lawmakers on Wednesday approved a new referendum that would seek the amendment's repeal and instead ban most abortions with exceptions for rape an incest.",
      "The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then.",
      "Republican senators used a series of rare procedural moves to cut off discussion by opposing Democrats before passing the proposed abortion-rights revision by a 21-11 vote. The measure passed the Republican-led House last month.",
      "Immediately after the vote, protestors erupted with chants of \u201cStop the ban!\u201d and were ushered out of the Senate chamber.",
      "The Senate then blocked further Democratic debate and gave final approval to a separate measure repealing provisions of a voter-approved law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage. That measure does not go back to the ballot. It will instead become law when signed by Kehoe, who has expressed his support for it.",
      "After taking the sweeping votes, the Senate effectively ended its annual legislative session \u2014 two days ahead of a constitutional deadline to wrap up work.",
      "Democrats were outraged by the legislative actions and vowed to retaliate by slowing down any Senate work next year.",
      "\u201cOur rights are under attack,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Brian Williams said during debate. He accused Republicans of \u201ctrying to overturn the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Republicans contend they are simply giving voters a second chance on abortion \u2014 and are confident they will change their minds because of the new rape and incest exceptions.",
      "\u201cAbortion is the greatest tragedy in the world right now,\u201d Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman said while explaining her efforts to repeal the abortion-rights amendment. If someone's fine with \u201ctaking the life of an innocent, then probably you can justify whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Some GOP lawmakers said they needed to repeal the paid sick leave requirement, which kicked in May 1, because it's adding costs that threaten the financial viability of small businesses. Republicans had been negotiating with Democrats over an alternative to exempt only the smallest businesses before scrapping that and opting for the full repeal.",
      "Missouri lawmakers have a history of altering voter-approved policies. They previously tried to block funding for a voter-approved Medicaid expansion and authored changes to voter-approved measures regulating dog breeders and legislative redistricting.",
      "Missouri's abortion policies have swung dramatically in recent years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning most abortions. But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "A limited number of surgical abortions have since occurred in Missouri, but medication abortions remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Polling indicates \u201cthat most voters are opposed to most abortions in Missouri but do want to allow for abortions with limited exceptions,\u201d said Sam Lee, director of Campaign Life Missouri.",
      "The ballot title that voters will see doesn't explicitly mention repealing Amendment 3. Instead, it says the new measure would \u201censure women's safety during abortions, ensure parental consent for minors\" and \u201callow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.\u201d It also states that it will \u201cprotect children from gender transition,\u201d among other provisions.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery called the measure \u201can attempt to mislead and lie to the voters,\u201d echoing similar accusations that Republicans had made against the original Amendment 3.",
      "An abortion-rights coalition that includes Planned Parenthood affiliates, the American Civil Liberties Union and others planned a rally Thursday at the Missouri Capitol and vowed a vigorous campaign against the measure.",
      "\u201cAbortion rights won in this state six months ago, and mark my words: Missourians will protect reproductive freedom again,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency says it will roll back limits on several types of what are known as forever chemicals in drinking water",
      "On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.",
      "The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.",
      "President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.",
      "Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:",
      "PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation\u2019s air, water and soil.",
      "They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.",
      "The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.",
      "Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable \u2013 resistance to breakdown \u2013 make them hazardous to people.",
      "PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.",
      "There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.",
      "The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.",
      "The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.",
      "It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration\u2019s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.",
      "For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years \u2014 until 2031 \u2014 to meet them.",
      "Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.",
      "\u201cThe law is very clear that the EPA can\u2019t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,\u201d said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.",
      "Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.",
      "\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,\u201d the industry group said.",
      "Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.",
      "Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "They did, however, get an extension.",
      "\u201cThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,\u201d said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy wanted an assurance from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before he would vote to put him in charge of the nation's $1.7 trillion health department.",
      "Kennedy's history of promoting conspiracy theories or misspeaking about vaccines alarmed Cassidy, he said during a confirmation hearing earlier this year.",
      "So, the Louisiana senator asked: \"Can I trust that that is now in the past?\"",
      "Kennedy didn't give a direct answer that day. Now three months into the job, however, Kennedy's habit of casting doubts on vaccines has returned in interviews on television shows, public speeches and social media posts.",
      "Kennedy will make his first appearance as health secretary before Cassidy\u2019s powerful Senate health committee on Wednesday, when he's expected to face intense scrutiny about the thousands of job he's eliminated at the Department of Health and Human Services, the steep cuts he's made to vaccination campaigns and his response to a measles outbreak that\u2019s sickened 1,000 people.",
      "He will speak about the agency\u2019s budget request for the year, which includes a $500 million boost for his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative to promote nutrition and healthier lifestyles. The proposed budget also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and preschool programs.",
      "The secretary plans to \"share his vision on how HHS\u2019 transformation will improve health outcomes, eliminate redundancies to save the American taxpayer, and streamline operations to improve efficiency and service,\u201d HHS said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, have viewed his first three months in the job as a successful delivery of \u201cMAHA\u201d agenda items: He's pressured food companies to ditch artificial dyes, promised to study the cause of autism, vowed to reverse fluoride recommendations and earned buy-in from several Republican governors to ban soda from the food stamp program, for example.",
      "But many eyes and ears will be on Kennedy's dialogue with Cassidy, who extracted a number of guarantees from Kennedy about his approach to vaccines. Those included promises to keep the current childhood vaccination schedule, use the current vaccine monitoring system and not remove statements that say vaccines do not cause autism on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.",
      "\u201cI will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidences and anecdote,\u201d Cassidy said earlier this year, after voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy has since delivered a mixed message on vaccines that public health experts have said are hampering efforts to contain the measles outbreak. He's offered endorsements of vaccinations but continued to raise questions about their efficacy or safety. He's said the childhood vaccine schedule will be examined in a study of autism's causes. He\u2019s called the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine \u2014 a shot given to children to provide immunity from all three diseases \u2014 \u201cleaky,\u201d although it offers lifetime protection from the measles for most people. He's also said they cause deaths, although none has been documented among healthy people.",
      "At the agency, too, he's made moves that support the anti-vaccine movement. He hired a man who has published research that suggests vaccines cause developmental delays to oversee a study on autism. And he's terminated some research and public health funds dedicated to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who has rejected the anti-vaccine label, has regularly said that he is \u201cpro-safety\" and wants more research on vaccines, although decades of real-world use and research have concluded they safely prevent deadly diseases in children.",
      "\u201cHis longstanding advocacy has always focused on ensuring that vaccines, and other medical interventions, meet the highest standards of safety and are supported by gold-standard science,\u201d HHS said in a statement. \u201cAs he did during confirmation, Secretary Kennedy is prepared to address questions surrounding this topic.\u201d",

      "A British man on trial for drug offenses has pleaded for leniency in a court on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali after a charge of trafficking that could carry the death penalty was dropped",
      "DENPASAR, Indonesia -- A British man on trial for drug offenses pleaded for leniency Tuesday in a court on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali after a charge that could carry the death penalty was dropped.",
      "Thomas Parker, from Cumbria in northwest England, was arrested on Jan. 21, at a villa near Kuta beach, a popular tourist spot, after he allegedly collected a package from a motorcycle taxi driver at a nearby street.",
      "According to the court document obtained by The Associated Press, Parker was noticed \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d by officers while he was collecting the package. He allegedly discarded it in a panic and fled when police approached him. He was traced back to the villa where he was staying and was arrested.",
      "The court document said a lab test result confirmed the package containing slightly over a kilogram (2.326 pounds) of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, the main ingredient in ecstasy.",
      "Parker was initially charged with drug trafficking and could have faced the death penalty by firing squad if found guilty.",
      "However, the trafficking charge was dropped after police investigators determined that the package was not directly linked to him.",
      "The case went unreported until authorities showed a handcuffed Parker at a news conference on March 6.",
      "During the police investigation, the 32-year-old electrician was able to prove that he did not order the package. It was sent by a drug dealer friend, identified only as Nicky, who Parker had known for around two years and spoke to regularly through the Telegram messaging app.",
      "During the trial that began last month, Parker told the court he initially refused to collect the package but later agreed to do it after Nicky assured him that the package was safe and would not put him in danger.",
      "Parker was told someone would pick it up shortly from him, his lawyer, Edward Pangkahila said. Parker was not promised money or anything else by Nicky in return, Pangkahila said.",
      "Authorities reduced the charge from trafficking to the less serious offense of hiding information from authorities. Prosecutors on May 6 sought a one-year prison term for Parker.",
      "However, under Indonesian legal system, judges have an important role as legal determinants in a trial. They could seek further charges if applicable laws are unclear or non-existent, meaning that the trafficking charge could be reinstated.",
      "Pangkahila said that Parker last met Nicky a year ago when he was on vacation in Thailand.",
      "As his friend was a dealer, Parker worried the package was filled with drugs. He panicked when he saw police officers on the street and and was approached by them, Pangkahila said.",
      "Wearing a white shirt and black trousers, Parker repeatedly expressed his remorse in his final plea on Tuesday and asked the panel of three judges in Denpasar District Court to consider his situation and impose a lenient sentence.",
      "\u201cI am very sorry and apologize, I know it was a mistake,\u201d Parker said, \u201cI promise not to repeat it again, because I really didn\u2019t know that (the package) was drugs.\u201d",
      "After Parker read out his plea, Presiding Judge Gusti Ayu Akhirnyani adjourned the trial until May 27, when the judges will read out their sentence in a verdict.",
      "\u201cUntil now, they (prosecutors) cannot prove that our client is a middleman or trafficker,\u201d Pangkahila said, \u201cHe has no connection with any drug network, we hope the judges will come to the same conclusion.\u201d",
      "He said his client is nervous and depressed as he faces trial.",
      "Indonesia has very strict drug laws and convicted traffickers can be executed by a firing squad.",
      "About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections\u2019 data showed. Indonesia\u2019s last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.",

      "Khamenei\u2019s remarks came as indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. reportedly continue, though he expressed doubt about their outcome.",

      "His comments reflect Tehran\u2019s growing frustration with the stalled nuclear discussions, as well as the broader tensions that have defined U.S.-Iran relations in recent years.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei told the state-run IRNA news agency that \u201cno definitive decision has been made about the next round of negotiations,\u201d adding that \u201cthe Islamic Republic of Iran is reviewing the matter while considering the U.S. side\u2019s contradictory and constantly changing positions.\u201d",
      "IRNA also reported that Kazem Gharibabadi, the deputy foreign minister, said that Tehran had received a proposal regarding the next round of indirect talks with Washington and was currently reviewing it.",

      "TAIPEI -- China has long sought to intimidate Taiwan with its massive navy, air force and the world\u2019s largest standing army, but it\u2019s mere dinghies that are now causing the most consternation.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s coast guard has documented five cases totaling 38 Chinese citizens crossing the 160-kilometer (100-mile) wide Taiwan Strait separating the self-governing island democracy from the authoritarian Chinese mainland, according to the body's deputy director-general Hsieh Ching-chin.",
      "That includes at least one case posted to Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, in which a man speaking with a strong mainland Chinese accent is seen planting a Chinese flag on what he says is a Taiwanese beach. Scenes in the background appear to show a stretch of coastline south of the capital Taipei.",
      "China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be conquered by force if necessary. The man has not been found or publicly identified, and Taiwanese authorities are seeking to ascertain whether he received help from anyone on the island.",
      "Another case involved a father and son who were apprehended shortly after reaching land, along with a man who came ashore at a fishing port in a popular tourist area north of Taipei.",
      "The small size of the boats, some just inflatables for having fun at the beach, makes it difficult for Taiwan's radar to pick them up. More cameras and other detection devices and manpower would be needed to cover the vast spaces of inhospitable coastline surrounding the island, but the terrain would make a Chinese D-Day-type landing highly challenging.",
      "While such cases are not unheard of, they come amid a rise in tensions between the sides, with Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te designating China as an enemy to be defended against, and China holding frequent military exercises seen as a rehearsal for an invasion or boycott of Taiwan.",
      "Those entering Taiwan illegally are liable to a fine of 500,000 Taiwan dollars ($16,666) and five years in prison, but such penalties are usually waived as long as no one is hurt and there is no property damage. In the 1990s, there was a wave of hijackings by Chinese to Taiwan, but the perpetrators were sent home after serving brief prison terms in Taiwan.",
      "In addition to facing China's formidable military, Taiwan faces a range of so-called \"gray area\" strategies, including in the media and among entertainers hoping to grab a share of the massive Chinese market. Taiwan has also deported the Chinese wives of Taiwanese men for posting videos supporting a takeover of the island.",
      "The small boat landings may be a further attempt to confuse and undermine confidence among the public, Hsieh said.",

    "story": [
      "The parents of Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier who was held captive in Gaza for 19 months, are overjoyed he is home and slowly absorbing their son's life in captivity",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- For two days after Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander was released from 19 months of captivity in Gaza, he couldn\u2019t eat anything. Despite periods of near starvation while being held by Hamas militants, Alexander just didn\u2019t have an appetite.",
      "Then, his mother, Yael Alexander, put a burger and fries in front of him, and her son dove in.",
      "It was one of many joyful moments his family has experienced since learning he would be freed.",
      "Hamas portrayed the release of Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, as a gesture to President Donald Trump ahead of his Mideast tour last week, which the militants hoped would revive ceasefire talks. Instead, Israel launched a renewed offensive days later that families of the remaining hostages fear could put their loved ones in grave danger.",
      "Alexander's father was somewhat heartened by Israel's announcement Monday that some aid was going into Gaza for the first time in 2 1/2 months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first step forward, so hopefully we\u2019ll see another ceasefire, more releases and the end to this conflict,\u201d Adi Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long, too much, and you can\u2019t treat agony with more agony. It\u2019s enough.\u201d",
      "He urged Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to \"rise above politics to prioritize human life.\u201d",
      "The family had just finished celebrating Mother's Day at their home in New Jersey when Adi Alexander saw eight missed calls from Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast envoy. Witkoff told them to turn on the TV because Hamas was about to announce their son would be released.",
      "\u201cWe were freaking out,\u201d he said. The family raced to book flights to Israel. Alexander's mother traveled with Trump\u2019s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler. His father and the couple's other two children arrived just minutes before Edan Alexander crossed into Israel from Gaza.",
      "Alexander was one of 251 people kidnapped during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight hostages alive and recovered more than 40 bodies.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The campaign has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.",
      "The lowest point of his 584 days of captivity, Alexander told his parents, was being dragged into Gaza and pushed into a tunnel. For hours, he was held alone underground until 10 other hostages were thrust in with him.",
      "That came as a relief. His father said his son\u2019s biggest fear was being kidnapped alone, like an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza in 2006, who was held for years until he was released in a 2011 exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Edan Alexander told his parents he was kept mostly underground and moved frequently between tunnels with other hostages. There was very little food, and he rarely saw sunlight or was able to breathe fresh air. In the beginning, like many other male hostages, he was kept handcuffed, sometimes with a sack over his head, and interrogated.",
      "The 6-foot-tall (180 cm) Alexander dropped to around 130 pounds (60 kilograms) from around 175 pounds (80 kilograms) before he was kidnapped.",
      "The conditions of his son\u2019s captivity improved slightly following Trump\u2019s election in November, Adi Alexander said. During a weekslong ceasefire earlier this year, he was given meat and vegetables for the first time, but that ended once Israel reimposed the blockade on Gaza in March.",
      "Adi Alexander said the family is beyond grateful to Trump and the American officials who worked tirelessly to free their son. He lived in Maryland as a young child and graduated from high school in Tenafly, New Jersey. He moved to Israel in 2022 and volunteered for the Israeli army.",
      "The day after Alexander's release, American officials Boehler and Witkoff visited what's come to be known as Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, meeting with families of those held in Gaza.",
      "Hostage families said they left the meeting optimistic there would be more releases. But Trump ended a whirlwind trip through three Gulf countries without additional announcements, and Israel renewed its military campaign on Saturday, dashing hopes for immediate releases.",
      "Alexander's parents said as soon as they catch their breath the family will resume the fight to win the hostages' release. They have been a constant presence at rallies, speaking with the media and politicians, shuttling between New Jersey, Washington and Israel. Alexander's terminally-ill great-aunt managed to hold on until he was safe. She died just after hearing he was with the Red Cross, Yael Alexander said.",
      "Edan Alexander returned weak and pale, but his parents say they see him gaining strength each day. The hamburger two days after his release was a turning point.",
      "\u201cI was sitting there and looking at him with this big smile on my face, and I\u2019m like, oh my God, because he was like, craving the hamburger,\u201d Yael Alexander said.",
      "For now, Edan Alexander is back in the room in his grandmother\u2019s apartment in Tel Aviv where he stayed during breaks from the army before his abduction.",
      "He\u2019s reconnected with some hostages, including Sagui Dekel Chen, an American-Israeli who was released during the previous ceasefire. He\u2019s visiting with old friends from the army and New Jersey, squeezing in doctor\u2019s appointments between hanging out with his siblings.",
      "There are quiet moments that have stuck out to his mother over the past week, when he does normal things, like scrolling through Spotify. Seeing her three children together. Simply being able to touch him, hug him.",
      "It's a long path to recovery, but there are moments of bliss, like seeing him share a beer with his sister on the hospital rooftop. It was his first \u201clegal\u201d beer, since he turned 21 in captivity, a rite of passage since that's the legal drinking age in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt was like, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m back, I have my sunglasses, I have a beer in my hand, and we are all good,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Syria's capital, Damascus, is suffering from its worst water shortages in years as a result of the lowest rainfall in more than six decades",
      "BARADA VALLEY, Syria -- Inside a mountain above the Syrian capital, Hassan Bashi walked through tunnels that used to be filled with water from a spring famous for its pure waters.",
      "The spring rises inside the ruins of a Roman temple in the Barada Valley and flows toward Damascus, which it has been supplying with drinking water for thousands of years. Normally, during the winter flood season, water fills all the tunnels and washes over much of the temple.",
      "Now, there is only a trickle of water following the driest winter in decades.",
      "Bashi, who is a guard but also knows how to operate the pumping and water filtration machines in the absence of the engineer in charge, displayed an old video on his cell phone of high waters inside the ruins.",
      "\u201cI have been working at the Ein al-Fijeh spring for 33 years and this is the first year it is that dry,\u201d Bashi said.",
      "The spring is the main source of water for 5 million people, supplying Damascus and its suburbs with 70% of their water.",
      "As the city suffers its worst water shortages in years, many people now rely on buying water from private tanker trucks that fill from wells.",
      "Government officials are warning that the situation could get worse in the summer and are urging residents to use water sparingly while showering, cleaning or washing dishes.",
      "\u201cThe Ein al-Fijeh spring is working now at its lowest level,\u201d said Ahmad Darwish, head of the Damascus City Water Supply Authority, adding that the current year witnessed the lowest rainfall since 1956.",
      "The channels that have been there since the day of the Romans two millennia ago were improved in 1920 and then again in 1980, he said.",
      "Darwish said the springwater water comes mainly from rainfall and melted snow off the mountains along the border with Lebanon, but because of this year\u2019s below-average rainfall, \u201cit has given us amounts that are much less than normal.\u201d",
      "There are 1.1 million homes that get water from the spring, and in order to get through the year, people will have to cut down their consumption, he said.",
      "The spring also feeds the Barada River that cuts through the capital. It is mostly dry this year.",
      "In Damascus\u2019s eastern area of Abbasids, Bassam Jbara is feeling the shortage. His neighborhood only gets water for about 90 minutes a day, compared with previous years when water was always running when they turned on the taps.",
      "Persistent electricity cuts are making the problem worse, he said, as they sometimes have water but no power to pump it to the tankers on the roof of the building. Jbara once had to buy five barrels of undrinkable water from a tanker truck that cost him and his neighbors $15, a large amount of money in a country where many people make less than $100 a month.",
      "\u201cFrom what we are seeing, we are heading toward difficult conditions regarding water,\u201d he said, fearing that supplies will drop to once or twice a week over the summer. He is already economizing.",
      "\u201cThe people of Damascus are used to having water every day and to drinking tap water coming from the Ein al-Fijeh spring, but unfortunately the spring is now weak,\" Jbara said.",
      "During Syria\u2019s 14-year conflict, Ein al-Fijeh was subjected to shelling on several occasions, changing between forces of then- President Bashar Assad and insurgents over the years.",
      "In early 2017, government forces captured the area from insurgents and held it until December when the five-decade Assad dynasty collapsed in a stunning offensive by fighters led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, of current President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Tarek Abdul-Wahed returned to his home near the spring in December nearly eight years after he was forced to leave with his family and is now working on rebuilding the restaurant he owned. It was blown up by Assad\u2019s forces after he left the area.",
      "Abdul-Wahed looked at the dry area that used to be filled with tourists and Syrians who would come in the summer to enjoy the cool weather.",
      "\u201cThe Ein al-Fijeh spring is the only artery to Damascus,\u201d Abdul-Wahed said as reconstruction work was ongoing in the restaurant that helped 15 families living nearby make a living in addition to the employees who came from other parts of Syria.",
      "\u201cNow it looks like a desert. There is no one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that the good old days return with people coming here.\u201d",

      "A French Senate inquiry commission says the government of President Emmanuel Macron covered up decisions over the illegal treatment of mineral water by food industry giant Nestle",
      "PARIS -- The government of French President Emmanuel Macron covered up decisions over the illegal treatment of mineral water by food industry giant Nestle, including the world-famous Perrier brand, a Senate inquiry commission said Monday.",
      "Its report focused on Nestle's years of use of treatments to avoid bacterial or chemical contamination of water labeled as \u201cnatural mineral water\u201d or \u201cspring water\u201d for brands also including Contrex, Vittel and H\u00e9par. Such treatments are prohibited under French and European regulations.",
      "The report concluded that France's government had concealed \u201cillegal practices.\"",
      "\u201cIn addition to Nestle Waters\u2019 lack of transparency, the French government\u2019s lack of transparency must also be highlighted,\u201d it said.",
      "French media reported the banned treatments last year.",
      "The report noted a \"deliberate strategy\" of concealment since the first government meeting on the issue in October 2021. Months later, authorities agreed to a Nestle plan to replace the banned treatments with microfiltering.",
      "Nestle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. France\u2019s government did not immediately comment.",
      "Last year, the Swiss company publicly acknowledged having used treatments on mineral waters and agreed to pay a 2 million euro fine ($2.2 million) to avoid legal action.",
      "The inquiry commission interviewed more than 120 people including Nestle\u2019s CEO and top managers. One refused to speak to it: Alexis Kohler, then-secretary general of the Elysee presidential palace, who the report said has spoken several times with Nestle executives by phone or in person.",
      "The commission concluded \u201cthat the presidency of the republic had known, at least since 2022, that Nestle had been cheating for years.\u201d",
      "Asked about scandal in February, Macron said he was \u201cnot aware of these things ... There is no collusion with anyone.\u201d",
      "Alexandre Ouizille, the commission's rapporteur, said the total amount of the fraud has been estimated at over 3 billion euros ($3.38 billion) by France's agency in charge of fraud control.",
      "Natural mineral water is sold about 100 to 400 times the price of tap water, he said, denouncing \"misleading of consumers.\"",
      "Ouizille described a Nestle plant in southern France the commission visited where there were \u201csliding cabinets behind which illegal treatments were carried out.\u201d",
      "The report said Nestle argued there was a risk of job losses if the government did not authorize some kind of treatment or microfiltration, because its plants would have to close due to spring water being contaminated by bacteria like E. coli that can cause serious illness and death.",
      "Laurent Burgoa, the president of the commission, said there has been no proven harm to the health of people who drank water sold by Nestle.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I drank some Perrier ... But I didn\u2019t know what I was drinking, that\u2019s the problem,\" Burgoa said.",

      "Portugal\u2019s third general election in three years has failed to deliver the result that could break the worst spell of political instability for decades in the European Union country of 10.6 million people",
      "LISBON -- Portugal's third general election in three years has failed to deliver the result that could break the worst spell of political instability for decades in the European Union country of 10.6 million people.",
      "Sunday's vote delivered another minority government for the center-right Democratic Alliance, which will be at the mercy of opposition parties. The significant rise in support for the hard-right populist party Chega (Enough) adds more uncertainty.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, led by the Social Democratic Party, lost a vote of confidence in parliament in March as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an election, which had been due in 2028.",
      "The confidence vote was sparked by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro\u2019s family law firm. Montenegro, who is poised to become prime minister again, has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The Democratic Alliance captured at least 89 seats in the 230-seat National Assembly. Chega collected the same number of seats as the center-left Socialists \u2014 58 \u2014 and could yet claim second place when four remaining seats decided by voters abroad are attributed in coming days.",
      "Chega competed in its first election just six years ago, when it won one seat, and has fed off disaffection with the more moderate traditional parties. Its success shook up the traditional balance of power in a trend already witnessed elsewhere in Europe with parties such as France\u2019s National Rally, the Brothers of Italy, and Alternative for Germany, which are now in the political mainstream.",
      "For the past 50 years, the Social Democrats and the center-left Socialist Party have alternated in power in Portugal. The Socialists, meanwhile, are without a leader after Pedro Nuno Santos said he was standing down following the party\u2019s worst result since 1987.",
      "Smaller parties got the other seats.",
      "Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years, helping fuel the rise of Chega.",
      "Chega owes much of its success to its demands for a tighter immigration policy that have resonated with voters.",
      "Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. In 2018, there were fewer than a half-million legal immigrants in the country, according to government statistics. By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming. Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal.",
      "A housing crisis has also fired up debate. House prices and rents have been soaring for the past 10 years, due in part to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices.",
      "The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe\u2019s poorest countries. The average monthly salary last year was around 1,200 euros ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is 870 euros ($974) a month before tax.",
      "Portugal\u2019s head of state convened the country\u2019s political parties for consultations.",
      "President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has no executive power, was consulting with parties before inviting the election winner to form a government, in line with the constitution.",

Its claims include full compensation for the damage allegedly caused, including the cost of reinforcing the border. It did not specify a figure.",

      "Final results from the presidential race showed Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, winning 53.6% of the vote over the hard-right candidate George Simion, who had been considered the favorite in the run-off, boosted in the first round by his nationalist messaging.",
      "Sunday\u2019s final vote was held months after the annulment of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, following the surprise first-round success of far-right outsider Calin Georgescu.",
      "In an emotional speech after he secured the presidency, Dan told thousands of supporters gathered outside his headquarters near Bucharest City Hall that \u201cRomania begins a new chapter, and it needs every one of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt needs experts to get involved in various public policies, it needs people in civil society, it needs new people in politics,\u201d the 55-year-old said. \u201cWe have a Romania to build together, regardless of political choices.\u201d",
      "Born in 1969 in Romania\u2019s central town of Fagaras, Dan discovered \u201ca passion\u201d for mathematics in middle school and excelled academically. In the late 1980s, he won gold medals at the International Mathematics Olympiad, and in 1998 he obtained a doctorate in mathematics from Paris\u2019 prestigious Sorbonne University.",
      "In the late 90s, he returned to Romania, saying he was convinced his country needed him. \u201cI started organizing meetings with Romanian students in Paris in which we discussed what we could do to ensure that Romania took the right path as a country,\u201d he states on his official website.",
      "He then worked as a mathematics researcher at the Romanian Academy, the country\u2019s supreme scientific body, and later founded a school in Bucharest to meet the needs of Romanian students at an international level.",
      "Dan first rose to public prominence as a civil activist with his Save Bucharest Association. That was tasked with saving built heritage and fighting against illegal real estate projects in green spaces, in a system he described as a \u201creal estate mafia.\u201d He won hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "He has two children with his partner, and is fluent in English and French.",
      "More than a decade ago, Dan joined a protest movement against a controversial gold mining project by a Canadian company in a mountainous western region of Romania that contains some of Europe\u2019s largest gold deposits. He also joined a wave of anti-corruption protests that gripped Romania through the mid-2010s.",
      "In 2016, he then founded the reformist Save Romania Union party \u2014 at the time largely viewed as an anti-corruption party \u2014 but later left. In 2020, he successfully secured the mayorship of Bucharest and was elected for a second term last year.",
      "He has tackled some key infrastructure projects, such as modernizing Bucharest's ailing residential heating systems, which previous mayors have been accused of neglecting.",
      "In the presidential election rerun, Dan ran independently on an \u201cHonest Romania\u201d ticket, reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine, and fiscal reform. He has also been vocal against endemic corruption and promised fiscal reforms.",
      "Romania\u2019s chaotic election cycle has exposed deep societal divisions, and Dan reached out in his speech Sunday evening to those who favored Simion.",
      "\u201cWe have a Romania to build together, regardless of political choices,\u201d he said.",
      "After Dan is sworn in as president, he will face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government, no small task in a country whose political landscape is now fragmented.",
      "As winner of Sunday\u2019s race, Dan will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition\u2019s candidate to advance to the runoff. The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.",
      "Many observers saw Sunday\u2019s vote as crucial to maintaining Romania\u2019s place within Western alliances, especially as the war continues in neighboring Ukraine and the continent scrambles to arm itself as the United States\u2019 commitment to European partners has waned under US President Donald Trump.",
      "While Dan is a staunch advocate for Romania\u2019s strong membership of the EU and NATO, his civic and political background means he has limited foreign policy experience.",
      "Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, says what makes Dan unique in Romania is that he\u2019s \u201cnot taken the traditional route to being a politician, he\u2019s coming from the civil society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are certain advantages, but there are also certain disadvantages,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have any foreign affairs experience. I am not sure that he actually paid a lot of interest to what was happening outside Romania.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I know for sure is that \u2026 even though he may not be the best, he\u2019s probably the best of what we had in front of us.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- As a fan, Shaun Horne is all about Detroit's professional sports teams. But when it comes to playing, the high school junior has his eyes on one game.",
      "\u201cI only play golf,\u201d Horne said after taking his turn on a simulator inside a gym on Detroit's westside.",
      "Embracing golf makes the 16-year-old a rarity among his Detroit peers \u2014 particularly Black high schoolers.",
      "Coaches and community groups in the city are taking ambitious steps to spread the game's popularity among students \u2014 noting that only about 50 of more than 14,000 high school students in Detroit's school district play golf on school teams.",
      "In Detroit, the biggest challenge is exposing Black youth to the game, said Jesse Hawkins, who is Black and coaches Horne\u2019s team at Renaissance High School. Backing from local corporations and nonprofits, providing access to equipment and even college scholarships is helping.",
      "\u201cWhen you go into high schools and you go into elementary schools often times we\u2019ll hear narratives around basketball players, football games, those things,\u201d Hawkins said. \"And golf is really not as propagated as much for our community.\u201d",
      "In Detroit, advocates of increasing play among Black young people have partnered with some of the city's largest businesses and community organizations. At least two nonprofits offer programs that teach kids how to play golf.",
      "The Rocket Classic has steered nearly $10 million from the annual PGA event held in Detroit to local charitable organizations. Of that, $800,000 has been given to programs that teach kids how to play the game. One program provides access to college scholarships to high school seniors, while upward of 700 children and teens take part each year in programs put on by First Tee of Greater Detroit.",
      "\u201cGolf is the why we get them there, but while we have them there we\u2019re teaching them life skills,\u201d said Carl Bentley, chief executive of First Tee of Greater Detroit, which has donated a golf simulator to the school district. \u201cLearning how to say \u2018yes sir, yes ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2014 shake a hand properly, how to start a conversation. We\u2019re teaching them life skills and then we get to putting and swinging and things like that.\"",
      "Among the 28.1 million Americans who played golf on a course in 2024, about 25% were Black, Asian or Hispanic, according to the National Golf Foundation. Interest is wider when considering those who played or followed professional golf coverage on TV, in writing or via podcasts.",
      "But Hawkins said his experience as a coach suggests Black high schoolers aren't among that audience.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hear kids talking about the latest golf shoes or the cool golf apparel,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get a badge of honor walking into your high school and you\u2019ve got the newest golf shirt.\u201d",
      "Golf and equipment can be pricey, sometimes too pricey for families struggling just to make ends meet.",
      "Detroit, which is just under 80% Black, had a median income of about $39,500 in 2023 compared to $69,100 statewide, according to the census. The city\u2019s poverty level was about 32%. Statewide, that figure was about 13.5%.",
      "A set of good golf clubs can cost a few hundred dollars or more. It's $28 for juniors to play 18 holes and use a cart weekdays at the two public golf courses in Detroit.",
      "The PGA brought its first event to Detroit in 2019, and city native Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies has been its sponsor. The company works with partners to bring the game to Detroit\u2019s youth and cover some of the costs, said Trina Scott, vice president of Civic and Community Affairs at Detroit-based Rock, which is Gilbert\u2019s family office.",
      "\u201cHow do we attract Black and brown youth into seeing (golf) as a possibility?\u201d said Scott. \u201cOne way of doing that is by making it accessible (and) also eliminating the barriers \u2014 being able to have the right clothing to go on a golf course, being able to have the clubs that you need, being able to have the skillset to be confident on the course.\u201d",
      "Mike Schuchard has about a dozen players on his Detroit Cass Tech golf team. That's about double the number from last season, but only two are considered \u201cvarsity level.\"",
      "That\u2019s not enough to compete against some suburban schools with strong golf programs.",
      "The first-year golf coach says he's trying to recruit students who are already interested in others sports.",

      "Walthall County was hit especially hard by the massive storm system that wreaked havoc across multiple states. The storm spawned two significant tornadoes in the county, where four people died.",
      "McKee said the county has sunk an estimated $700,000 into cleaning up the damage but can\u2019t afford to spend more and has halted operations until it receives federal help.",
      "\u201cWe need federal help, and we need it desperately, and we need it now,\u201d said Bobby McGinnis, a Tylertown resident and firefighter. \u201cI know President Trump said that \u2014 America first, we\u2019re going to help our American folks first. But we haven\u2019t seen the federal folks down here.\u201d",

However, in India, which is the world's second largest steel-producing nation, overwhelming reliance on coal-based technologies presents a big challenge.",
      "\u201cIndia is now the bellwether of global steel decarbonization,\u201d said Astrid Grigsby-Schulte, project manager of the Global Iron and Steel Tracker at GEM and report co-author. \u201cIf the country does not increase its plans for green steel production, the entire sector will miss an important milestone. So goes India, so goes the world.\u201d",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which go into the atmosphere and heat the planet, come from steelmaking. That number could double in five years if steel is produced in line with the government\u2019s plans, according to the report.",
      "At the same time, India wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "By 2070, India also aims to go net zero, that is, it will either eliminate all carbon dioxide pollution it emits or cancel it out by using other methods, such as planting trees that absorb carbon.",
      "Steel production is one of the most carbon polluting industries, responsible for nearly 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency has set a target for 37% of global steelmaking capacity to rely on lower-emission electric arc furnaces by 2030. Current projections by GEM show the world reaching just 36% \u2014 a shortfall largely due to India\u2019s coal-heavy pipeline.",
      "India plans to expand its steel production capacity from 200 million to over 330 million tonnes per year by 2030. According to the new data, over 40% of global capacity in development \u2014 about 352 million tonnes per annum \u2014 is in India, with more than half of that using coal-based capacity.",
      "\u201cIndia is the only major steel-producing nation that has so much coal-based capacity in the pipeline,\u201d said Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM who also worked on the report.",
      "India\u2019s steel sector releases approximately 2.6 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of steel, roughly 25% more than the global average. China, the world\u2019s largest steelmaker, has managed to keep its emissions lower per ton by producing more scrap-based steel and retiring older coal-based plants.",
      "India\u2019s heavy dependence on coal for steelmaking is driven by a combination of factors: low-cost domestic coal, a relatively young fleet of blast furnaces that still have 20\u201325 years of operational life left, and a lack of natural gas and steel scrap. The country\u2019s scrap recycling ecosystem remains informal, and high-quality iron ore is scarce.",
      "\u201cThere is potential for India to change course,\u201d said Khadeeja of GEM. \u201cMuch of the planned capacity is still on paper. Only 8% of it has actually broken ground. This means there is still a window to shift toward lower-emission technologies.\u201d",
      "The consequences of producing carbon polluting steel may go beyond climate goals. While India\u2019s steel exports are only a small share of its overall production, they could suffer as major markets like the European Union begin enforcing carbon border taxes next year.",
      "\u201cIndia may be better off tolerating some short-term pain of technological upgrading to make its steel cleaner for long-term competitiveness gain,\u201d said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collaborative.",

      "The Trump administration is allowing work on a major offshore wind project for New York to resume",
      "The Trump administration is allowing work on a major offshore wind project for New York to resume.",
      "The developer, the Norwegian energy company Equinor, said Monday it was told by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that a stop-work order has been lifted for the Empire Wind project, allowing construction to resume.",
      "Work has been paused since Interior Secretary Doug Burgum last month directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction and review the permits. Burgum said at the time that it appeared former President Joe Biden's administration had \u201crushed through\u201d the approvals. Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits and has spent more than $2.5 billion so far on a project that is one-third complete.",
      "Equinor President and CEO Anders Opedal thanked President Donald Trump for allowing the project to move forward, saving about 1,500 construction jobs and investments in U.S. energy infrastructure. He also expressed appreciation to New York's governor, New York City's mayor, members of Congress and labor groups, as well as Norwegian officials who worked to save the project. The Norwegian government owns a majority stake in Equinor.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the fact that construction can now resume on Empire Wind, a project which underscores our commitment to deliver energy while supporting local economies and creating jobs,\u201d Opedal said in a statement.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said it took countless conversations with Equinor and White House officials, and the involvement of labor and business interests, to emphasize the project's importance and get Empire Wind back on track. Equinor is building Empire Wind south of Long Island, New York, to provide power in 2026 for more than 500,000 New York homes.",
      "\u201cNew York\u2019s economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive. I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York \u2014 and we got it done,\" Hochul said in a statement Monday.",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe and, more recently, in Asia. But the industry has struggled to grow in the U.S. due to high costs, difficulties growing a supply chain for materials and the lengthy permitting process.",
      "Trump has prioritized fossil fuels and moved against renewable energy since returning to the White House. One of his first acts was ordering a pause of offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects. But the administration\u2019s targeting of Empire Wind, a project already underway, took that a step further.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement Friday that while unleashing America\u2019s energy dominance, Trump \u201cpaused certain wind projects that are detrimental to our beloved wildlife including birds and whales.\u201d",
      "There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While wind turbines can pose a risk to birds, wildlife conservation organizations say they support the responsible development of offshore wind because climate change is a bigger threat.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Monday that lifting the stop-work order is welcome news. Empire Wind will greatly benefit the economy on Long Island and the environment for all New Yorkers, he said in a statement.",
      "Offshore wind advocates also celebrated the decision. It\u2019s a win for workers, the industry and companies in places like Louisiana, South Carolina and Pennsylvania, helping to build projects in the Northeast, the Oceantic Network said in a statement.",
      "Equinor said on May 9 it would be forced to abandon Empire Wind within days unless the administration relented on its order that stopped construction. Equinor was spending up to $50 million per week and had 11 vessels on standby.",
      "Equinor finalized the federal lease in March 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term. The federal government approved the construction and operations plan in February 2024.",
      "New York aims to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. New York is getting some wind power from the nation\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork that opened a year ago, operated by different companies east of Montauk Point, New York.",

      "More than 12,000 chicks at a Delaware distribution center were found left in a USPS truck for more than three days",
      "CAMDEN, Delaware -- A Delaware animal shelter is trying to care for and rehome thousands of chicks that survived being left in a postal service truck for three days. Trapped in a warm enclosure, without food and water, thousands died before they were discovered.",
      "Involved parties are still awaiting answers as to how 12,000 chicks were abandoned within the truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. The United States Postal Service said in an email that it was aware of a process breakdown and was actively investigating what occurred.",
      "Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, said a spokesperson for the company. Due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back.",
      "The spokesperson said it would have been best if USPS, after discovering the chicks, had completed delivery as the recipients would have been adequately equipped to handle the birds \u2014 even malnourished ones.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving chicks have been nursed and cared for at First State Animal Center and SPCA, said John Parana, executive director.",
      "Last Tuesday, the shelter began offering the birds for adoption, but only a few hundred out of thousands have been picked up. There is no complete count of the chicks, as the shelter has no feasible way to do so, but Parana estimates there to be more than two thousand available.",
      "Some have inquired about buying the birds for meat, but, as a no-kill shelter and SPCA, those were refused.",
      "The strain has turned the animal care center into a 24/7 operation and necessitated a staffing increase, Parana said. Money remains the biggest concern for the donation-reliant nonprofit. Some employees have begun spending their money to support the operations, he added.",
      "Among the birds were young turkeys, geese and quail, but the vast majority were Freedom Ranger chicks. One concern for the shelter, Parana explained, was the increasing demand for space and feed over time, as Freedom Rangers take about ten weeks to reach maturity.",
      "The Delaware Department of Agriculture, after a call from USPS, directed the animals to the shelter, which shares a memorandum of understanding with the animal center as a state vendor. The department said it is responsible for assisting the shelter with funds \u2014 for chickens, the rate was $5 each per day.",
      "The department's chief of planning, Jimmy Kroon, said negotiations were ongoing, but Parana claims that the department communicated that they had no funds to allocate for the chicks. Both acknowledged the original rate would be unreasonable in the current circumstances.",
      "\u201cThey said that they\u2019re gonna try to go after the post office to get recoupment,\u201d Parana said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help us in the meantime.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Whether it's a road trip to a nearby lake or jumping on a plane to explore a big city, Americans are expected to get away in record numbers over the long Memorial Day weekend even as economic and technical worries rattle the U.S. travel industry.",
      "Over 45 million people \u2014 1.4 million more than last year \u2014 will venture at least 50 miles from their homes between Thursday and next Monday, with the vast majority going by car, auto club organization AAA predicts. The holiday's previous domestic travel record was set 20 years ago.",
      "AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the analysts who prepared the forecast weren't sure when they started their research if concerns about the economy would cause fewer U.S. residents to plan getaways for the unofficial start of summer, but it doesn't seem to be the case.",
      "\u201cPeople are still feeling pretty good about travel,\u201d Diaz said, adding that some households and individuals may just opt to spend less money on their trips.",
      "Like last year, about 87% of travelers are driving to their Memorial Day destinations, AAA said. About 39 million people, or 1 million more than last year, are expected to take road trips, which Diaz noted many families find easier and cheaper than flying.",
      "\u201cYou leave whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can pack as much as you want in the car, make stops along the way.\u201d",
      "AAA's fuel tracker shows motorists can expect to pay less for gasoline this year; the U.S. average price on Sunday was $3.18 for a gallon of regular gas compared to $3.60 a year ago. Renting a vehicle and staying in a hotel also may cost less, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX anticipates the worst holiday traffic will be in the afternoons and evenings. It said drivers hitting the road on Thursday should leave before 12 p.m., and those planning Friday departures should leave before 11 a.m.",
      "On Memorial Day itself, the firm predicts the most congested time on roads will be 4 p.m.-7 p.m.",

      "Air safety has been on the minds of travelers after the deadly midair collision in January of a passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above Washington, D.C. In recent weeks, flight delays and cancellations stemming from an air traffic controller shortage and equipment failures at a facility that directs in and out of the Newark, New Jersey, airport have also made some people wonder whether to get on a plane.",
      "Most major U.S. airlines said they planned to reduce their scheduled domestic flights this summer, citing an ebb in economy passengers booking leisure trips. Bank of America reported this month that its credit card customers were spending less on flights and lodging.",
      "But an analysis by aviation data provider Cirium of Memorial Day weekend tickets bought through online travel sites found an increase of about 3% across two dozen U.S. airports compared to last year. Bookings were down 10% for flights at Washington Dulles International Airport and down 9% for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to Cirium's data.",
      "AAA said the weekend isn\u2019t expected to set a passenger volume record, but the organization estimates that 3.6 million residents are set to fly over the holiday, nearly 2% more than last year. Airfares cost an average of 7.9% less last month than they did a year earlier, according to government price data.",
      "The U.S. travel and tourism industry will watching during the weekend and the weeks ahead to see what might be in store for the summer travel season. Tourism industry experts have warned that anger about the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric, and concern about tourist detentions at the U.S. border, have made citizens of some other countries less interested in traveling to the U.S.",

      "The forecast for this year for the 20 countries that use the euro currency was cut to 0.9% from the previous forecast in November of 1.3%, the European Union's executive commission said Monday in its regular spring forecast.",
      "The forecast for 2026 was cut to 1.4% from 1.6%.",
      "One reason for the lower growth estimate was the stagnating economy in Germany, where growth is expected to be zero this year after two years of shrinking output. Germany's economy is heavily dependent on exports but has faced strong headwinds from higher energy costs after the loss of Russian natural gas due to the invasion of Ukraine as well from lack of pro-growth infrastructure spending and competition from China in autos and industrial machinery.",
      "The proposal for a 20% U.S. tariff on imported goods from Europe in addition to its suspension for 90 days have meant uncertainty \u201cnot seen since the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. He said the European economy remained \u201cresilient\u201d and that the jobs market remained robust, with the commission predicting a fall in unemployment to a record low 5.7% next year.",
      "And the risks are \u201ctilted to the downside,\u201d he said. One reason: The forecast assumes that the proposed 20% rate can be reduced through negotiations with Washington to the base tariff rate imposed on all countries of 10%.",
      "While the EU's top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, has spoken several times with administration officials it remains uncertain how willing Trump might be to reduce the rate.",
      "The forecast assumed that 25% tariffs on steel and autos from all countries will remain in place, as would exemptions on computer chips and pharmaceuticals.",

      "\u201cThe Portuguese don\u2019t want any more early elections,\u201d Luis Montenegro, the Democratic Alliance leader and incoming prime minister, said late Sunday in an appeal for opposition parties to let him serve a full four-year term.",
      "\u201cWe all have to be able to speak to each other and put the national interest first,\u201d he said.",
      "Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has no executive power, was consulting with parties before inviting the election winner to form a government, in line with the constitution.",
      "Chega\u2019s result shook up the traditional balance of power in a trend already witnessed elsewhere in Europe with parties such as France\u2019s National Rally, the Brothers of Italy, and Alternative for Germany, which are now in the political mainstream.",
      "Chega leader Andre Ventura has appeared at events with the leaders of those parties in recent years.",
      "For the past 50 years, the Social Democrats and the center-left Socialist Party have alternated in power in Portugal.",
      "Chega collected the same number of seats as the Socialists \u2014 58 \u2014 and could yet claim second place when four remaining seats decided by voters abroad are attributed in coming days.",
      "\u201cThe two-party system is over,\u201d Ventura, a lawyer and former soccer pundit, said.",
      "Chega competed in its first election just six years ago, when it won one seat, and has fed off disaffection with the more moderate traditional parties.",
      "Campaigning under the slogan \u201cSave Portugal,\u201d it describes itself as a nationalist party and has focused on curbing immigration and cracking down on corruption.",
      "On the streets of Lisbon, 42-year-old bank employee Marta Costa said she felt \u201cdisappointment and sadness\u201d at Chega\u2019s showing.",
      "\u201cWe are losing the world and not building something decent for our children,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we are not placing enough value on freedom.\u201d",
      "Emilia Gordo, 55, said voters expressed a desire for change. \u201cThey (Chega) are trying everything to bring about a change, the country feels a need for change.\u201d",
      "The Socialists, meanwhile, are without a leader after Pedro Nuno Santos said he was standing down after the party\u2019s worst result since 1987.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, which also includes the smaller Popular Party, lost a confidence vote in parliament in March as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an early election, which had been due in 2028.",
      "The confidence vote was sparked by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro\u2019s family law firm. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years, helping fuel the rise of Chega. But the party has recently fallen foul of its own lawmakers\u2019 alleged wrongdoing. One is suspected of stealing suitcases from the Lisbon airport and selling the contents online, and another allegedly faked the signature of a dead woman. Both resigned.",
      "Chega owes much of its success to its demands for a tighter immigration policy that have resonated with voters.",
      "Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. In 2018, there were fewer than a half-million legal immigrants in the country, according to government statistics. By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming.",
      "Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal. The Democratic Alliance government announced two weeks before the election that it was expelling about 18,000 foreigners living in the country without authorization. Though such a step is routine, the timing drew accusations that it was trying to capture votes from Chega.",
      "A housing crisis has also fired up debate. House prices and rents have been soaring for the past 10 years, due in part to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices.",
      "House prices jumped another 9% last year, said the National Statistics Institute, a government body. Rents in and around the capital Lisbon, where around 1.5 million people live, last year saw the steepest rise in 30 years, climbing more than 7%, the institute said.",
      "The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "The average monthly salary last year was around 1,200 euros ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is 870 euros ($974) a month before tax.",

    "story": [
      "Key economic indicators show China's economy slowing somewhat in April, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast",
      "China\u2019s economy showed signs of slowing in April as President Donald Trump's trade war took a toll, with retail sales, property and investment coming in weaker than economists had forecast.",
      "Industrial production slowed as Trump's painfully high tariffs of up to 145%, and 125% retaliatory duties imposed by Beijing, took effect and shipments were curtailed.",
      "National Statistics Bureau spokesperson Fu Linghui said the general trend was positive though he pointed to \u201cexternal shocks\u201d that had gained intensity.",
      "\u201cIt should also be noted that there are still many outside unstable and uncertain factors, and the foundation for the continued recovery and improvement of the national economy needs to be further consolidated,\u201d Fu said.",
      "Here are a few key indicators reported Monday.",
      "Chinese consumers have been holding back after the shocks of a prolonged downturn in the housing market that is the source of much household wealth. Retail sales rose 5.1% from a year earlier in April, below economists' expectations for a 6% increase.",
      "Fu said Beijing would continue to focus on supporting job creation and spurring more domestic demand.",
      "He also said China must stop prices from falling. The consumer price index fell 0.1% in April. Such deflation is both a symptom of weak demand and also a factor behind shoppers' reluctance to spend, in hopes of getting better deals later.",
      "\u201cThe current overall price level is low, which puts pressure on production and companies' operations and affects jobs and incomes, so it's important to promote a reasonable recovery of prices,\u201d Fu said.",
      "On the U.S. side, consumer sentiment has fallen slightly in May for the fifth straight month, with Americans increasingly worried that the trade war will worsen inflation.",
      "Industrial production rose 6.1% from a year earlier, slowing from 7.7% in March as tariffs and other trade barriers bit into exports.",
      "The truce in Trump's trade war with China has helped, Fu said, calling it \u201cconducive to the growth of bilateral trade and the recovery of the world.\u201d",
      "With tariffs paused for 90 days to allow time for talks, shipments have revived as businesses rush to meet back-to-school and other seasonal deadlines.",
      "But even before Trump took office for the second time in January, China was under pressure from its trading partners for relying too heavily on exports to absorb its excess industrial production.",
      "And if output continues to outpace demand from businesses and consumers, prices will keep falling.",
      "\u201cExport-driven gains in factory output could continue given China\u2019s manufacturing competitiveness and frontloaded orders before the end of the 90-day truce, but this is coming at a persistent deflationary cost,\u201d Louise Loo of Oxford Economics said in a report.",
      "The government reported that fixed asset investment in such things as factories and equipment rose 4% in April in the first four months of the year.",
      "However, property investments fell 10.3% year-on-year in January to April. New home prices also edged lower.",
      "While manufacturing held up better than expected, the pressures from trade are complicating Beijing's effort to keep turn the housing market around and keep the economic recovery on track.",
      "\u201cEstablishing a trough on a national level is taking some time, as the recovery of the property market remains uneven and gradual. It\u2019s possible that tariff-related pessimism and uncertainty kept more buyers on the sidelines in April,\u201d Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Economics said in a report.",

      "The decision to elevate the two countries\u2019 relations to strategic partnership \u201creflects our shared commitment to strengthen cooperation in several aspects on issues of mutual interest to the people of both countries,\u201d Paetongtarn said in a statement.",

      "Dozens of Indonesians earlier this year were freed from scam centers in Myanmar and repatriated through Thailand, in part of a large-scale regional crackdown effort. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have been lured to work in the region to commit global scams through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Many of the workers were recruited under false pretenses, only to find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "Ministers from both countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on health cooperation in a number of fields including prevention and control of communicable diseases and medical tourism.",

      "\u201cWe emphasized the importance of an inclusive national dialogue that can achieve peace and stability in Myanmar,\u201d Subianto said, \u201cWe also emphasized the importance of maintaining the unity and centrality of ASEAN.\u201d",
      "The crisis in Myanmar has emerged as one of the bloc\u2019s biggest challenges since a military coup ousted an elected civilian government in February 2021, plunging the country into conflict.

      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s government said Monday it has struck new agreements with the European Union on boosting defense cooperation, easing food trade and border checks.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deals will slash red tape, grow the British economy and reset relations with the 27-nation trade bloc since the U.K. left the EU in 2020.",
      "Starmer hosted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior EU officials in London for the first formal U.K.-EU summit since Brexit.",
      "Under the deals, a new U.K.-EU defense and security partnership will allow the U.K. to access a EU defense loan program worth 150 billion euros ($170 billion.)",
      "Other agreements include removing some checks on animal and plant products to ease food trade across borders, and a 12-year extension of an agreement allowing EU fishing vessels in U.K. waters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "While the EU is the U.K.\u2019s largest trading partner, the U.K. has been hit with a 21% drop in exports since Brexit because of more onerous border checks, laborious paperwork and other barriers.",
      "Since becoming prime minister in July, Starmer has sought to reset relations with the EU, following years of tensions in the wake of the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Post-Brexit relations have been governed by a trade agreement negotiated by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Starmer thinks that can be improved in a way that boosts trade and bolsters security.",
      "\u201cThis is about making people better off, about making the country more secure, about making sure there are more jobs in the U.K.,\u201d Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Times Radio.",
      "Stronger ties with the EU will bring \u201cmore benefits for the United Kingdom\u201d following trade agreements that the U.K. struck in recent weeks with India and the United States, Starmer said.",
      "Though no tariffs are slapped on the export of goods between both sides, an array of non-tariff barriers have made trade more difficult.",
      "Post-Brexit visa restrictions have also hobbled the cross-border activities of professionals such as bankers or lawyers, as well as cultural exchanges, including touring bands and school trips.",
      "Since the Labour Party took power last year after 14 years of Conservative government, a period that was largely marked by upheavals surrounding the Brexit vote and its aftermath, both sides have sought to improve relations.",
      "That\u2019s been most evident in the more coordinated response to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of a change of approach by Washington following the return of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "But Starmer has stressed that the U.K. won't rejoin the EU's frictionless single market and customs union, nor agree to the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU.",
      "Talks on strengthening ties have focused largely on security and defense, and on a youth mobility plan that would allow young Britons and Europeans to live and work temporarily in each other\u2019s territory.",
      "That remains a politically touchy issue in the U.K., seen by some Brexiteers as inching back toward free movement \u2014 though the U.K. already has youth mobility arrangements with countries including Australia and Canada.",
      "Another issue that has long been a sticking point in U.K.-EU relations is fishing \u2014 an economically minor but symbolically important issue for the U.K. and EU member states such as France. Disputes over the issue nearly derailed a Brexit deal back in 2020.",
      "The summit is also expected to cover aligning standards on the sale of agricultural products, which could eliminate costly checks on food products exported across the English Channel.",
      "Thomas-Symonds said he was confident that trade could be improved for food imports and exports.",
      "\u201cWe know we\u2019ve had lorries waiting for 16 hours, fresh food in the back not able to be exported, because frankly it\u2019s just going off, red tape, all the certifications that are required, we absolutely want to reduce that,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Some of the trade-offs may prove difficult for Starmer, who faces growing challenges from the pro-Brexit and anti-immigration Reform U.K. party and will likely see accusations of \u201cbetraying Brexit,\u201d whatever the outcome of the talks.",
      "Reform, which recently won big in local elections, and the opposition Conservative Party have already called the deal a \u201csurrender\u201d to the EU before any details were confirmed.",
      "Trump, who has backed Brexit, could also be a potential headache for Starmer.",
      "\u201cThe reset could still be blown off course by disagreements over how to consolidate existing areas of cooperation like fisheries and/or external factors, such as a negative reaction from the U.S. to the U.K. seeking closer ties with the EU,\u201d said Jannike Wachowiak, research associate at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank.",

The union said its members would return to work on Tuesday, when trains would resume their regular schedules.",

      "He added that the union was able to show management \"ways to boost engineers' wages ... without causing any significant budget issue or requiring a fare increase.\u201d",
      "The union statement also said the deal would be submitted for a ratification vote by the national union and would require a vote of the New Jersey Transit board at its next regularly scheduled meeting on June 11. NJ Transit's board also has to approve the deal.",
      "\u201cTo offer the understatement of the year, this is a very good outcome,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said at a Sunday evening news conference. He commended the two sides for finding an agreement that is \u201cboth fair to NJ Transit\u2019s employees while also being affordable for our state\u2019s commuters and taxpayers.\u201d",
      "NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri didn\u2019t provide details of the deal, but said it was \u201cfair and fiscally responsible.\" He thanked the union for negotiating in good faith.",
      "\u201cThe deal itself reflects a series of concessions that came together by way of a work bill that will eventually end up paying for this fair wage that the union has asked for,\u201d Kolluri said at the news conference.",
      "Buses would be provided on Monday, but Murphy and Kolluri both urged commuters, if possible, to work from home for one more day.",
      "\u201cPlease do that tomorrow so we can move essential employees through the system,\u201d Kolluri said.",
      "A month earlier, members of the union had overwhelmingly rejected a labor agreement with management.",
      "NJ Transit \u2014 the nation\u2019s third-largest transit system \u2014 operates buses and rail in the state, providing nearly 1 million weekday trips, including into New York City. The walkout halted all NJ Transit commuter trains, which provide heavily used public transit routes between New York City\u2019s Penn Station on one side of the Hudson River and communities in northern New Jersey on the other, as well as the Newark airport, which has grappled with unrelated delays of its own recently.",
      "Mark Wallace, the union's national president, had said NJ Transit needs to pay engineers a wage that\u2019s comparable to Amtrak and Long Island Railroad because some are leaving for jobs on those other railroads for better pay.",
      "The union had said its members have been earning an average salary of $113,000 a year and it wanted to see an agreement for an average salary of $170,000.",
      "NJ Transit leadership, though, disputed the union\u2019s data, saying the engineers have average total earnings of $135,000 annually, with the highest earners exceeding $200,000.",

    "story": [
      "The Tour de France is set for a dramatic finale in July after organizers announced a climb up Montmartre in Paris on the final day",
      "PARIS -- Breaking with tradition at the Tour de France is stirring controversy.",
      "Since race organizers announced plans last week to climb the iconic Montmartre hill in Paris during the final stage in July, the cycling world has been abuzz. Could the climb actually decide the Tour winner? Or disrupt the final sprint by injecting tactical uncertainty into what is usually a celebratory day?",
      "Well, that remains to be seen. But one thing seems certain: The stage will be a spectacle.",
      "At last year\u2019s Olympics, massive crowds lined the streets of Montmartre \u2014 the area in the northern part of Paris that is popular among artists and offers grand vistas of the city \u2014 to cheer on riders.",
      "Inspired by the frenetic atmosphere and willing to build on the momentum, Tour organizers said this month that riders competing in cycling\u2019s biggest race this summer would climb the Montmartre hill and pass beneath the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica before \"battling it out on a stage that may break from the traditions established over the past 50 years in the heart of the capital.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, the Tour final stage is largely processional until a sprint decides the day\u2019s winner on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Last year\u2019s final stage was held outside Paris for the first time since 1905 because of a clash with the Olympics, moving instead to Nice. The world famous avenue is back on the program this year for the conclusion of the 3,320-kilometer (2,060-mile) race.",
      "The inclusion of the steep Montmartre climb could dramatically change the dynamics of the stage. If the hill features just a few kilometers from the finish line, or is climbed several times, pure sprinters will likely be dropped before they can compete for the stage win. And if the general classification remains tight ahead of the final stage, the yellow jersey itself could be decided in Paris.",
      "Full details of the route will be presented at a news conference on Wednesday. With a peloton roughly twice as big as it was at the Olympics, organizers are working with Paris authorities and the Prefecture of police to ensure the security of the race on the narrow and cobbled streets of the area. But some top riders have already expressed their lack of enthusiasm about the addition.",
      "\u201cMontmartre was nice to do in the Olympics, it seemed good, a lot of people, a really good atmosphere,\u201d two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard told reporters this week. \u201cBut when they came to the Montmartre, there was only 15 riders left in the bunch. And when we do the Tour de France, there will be 150 guys fighting for positions on a very narrow climb. It could end up being more stress than they want to have.\u201d",
      "Even Remco Evenepoel, who won the Olympic men\u2019s road race in Paris last year and the gold medal in the time trial, is also opposed to the idea.",
      "\u201cThere will be enough battle for positioning in the first week of the Tour,\" he told sports media Sporza. \"With Montmartre added, that would mean we have to do the same on the last day. We will be tired enough by then.\u201d",
      "Evenepoel also lamented the fact that sprinters would be robbed of a rare chance to claim a prestigious win on the world famous avenue.",
      "\u201cThey get a big chance every year to sprint for a stage win on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es,\" he said. \u201cThat chance is then taken away from them. In my opinion, Montmartre is an unnecessary obstacle.\u201d",
      "Marc Madiot, who manages the Groupama-FDJ team, said bad weather on the final day could make the stage more treacherous.",
      "\u201cImagine a slight rain in Paris; it\u2019s not going to be easy for the riders,\u201d he told RMC Radio. \u201cDo we want a show? Do we want to visit Paris? Do we want to commemorate the Olympics? If we expect a real race, we could be disappointed. And if we do get a real race, we put everything that has happened in the last three weeks in jeopardy.\"",
      "The Tour starts from the northern city of Lille on July 5, and the women\u2019s race kicks off on July 26 from the Brittany town of Vannes.",

      "Cool has scaled Mount Everest almost every year since 2004.",

      "Only Nepali Sherpa guides have scaled the peak more times than Cool. Kami Rita holds the record for the most successful ascents of Mount Everest at 30 times. He is currently on the mountain and is expected to attempt to reach the top in the next few days.",
      "Cool said his climb was smooth and that he faced no problems, but he noticed that many climbers were trying to reach the peak on the same day.",
      "Hundreds of climbers and their guides are on the mountain during the popular spring climbing season, hoping to scale the world\u2019s highest peak.",
      "\u201cMountaineering is an amazing sport which is open to everybody, but you just need to be part of it responsibly and we have seen some people coming to Everest \u2014 perhaps they do not have the experience that they should,\u201d Cool said, adding that it was not necessary to limit the number of climbers each season.",
      "Several climbers have already scaled the peak this month and hundreds more and their guides are on the mountain attempting to reach the summit before the climbing season finishes at the end of this month. Weather conditions then deteriorate with the rainy monsoon season making climbing more difficult.",

      "Fans booed when Landon Knack gave up two-run shots to Gurriel and Moreno that made it 7-0 in the third inning. Dodgers opener Jack Dreyer (2-2) let the D-backs build a 3-0 lead on Eugenio Su\u00e1rez\u2019s RBI double, Josh Naylor\u2019s RBI groundout and Perdomo\u2019s sacrifice fly.",

      "Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and Team Penske teammate Will Power will have to start from the final two spots on the grid Sunday after their teams were penalized for violating the rules during qualifying weekend.",
      "IndyCar also announced Monday that the team strategists for the Nos. 2 and 12 have been suspended for the race; the cars will forfeit their qualification points and pit box selections; and each of the entries has been fined $100,000.",
      "It's the second time in just over a year that Team Penske's IndyCar program has been embroiled in controversy.",
      "\u201cThe integrity of the Indianapolis 500 is paramount,\" IndyCar president Doug Boles said. \u201cAs we look to the remainder of the week and race weekend, we will do everything we can to make it clear that this is not only the best racing on the planet but racing where the best win under completely fair conditions.\u201d",
      "The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused it of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and deduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.",
      "Tim Cindric, the president of Penske\u2019s IndyCar program, said Power passed inspection but officials had flagged Newgarden\u2019s car, and he was told neither would pass inspection after making their runs. So, the cars were pulled from the lineup altogether.",
      "Boles initially said late Sunday that Newgarden and Power would join teammate Scott McLaughlin \u2014 who had crashed in practice on Sunday and was unable to make a qualifying run \u2014 in the fourth row for the race. But after the series gathered more facts and considered the case, the decision was made to put Newgarden in the 32nd starting spot and Will Power in the 33rd.",
      "McLaughlin will keep the 10th starting spot because his wrecked car was found to have used a legal attenuator.",
      "\u201cThis violation of the IndyCar rule against modification to this part and using it \u2018as supplied\u2019 is clear,\u201d Boles said. \"The penalty should be more than simply starting where the cars might have qualified anyway, if given the opportunity. The cars belong in the field as two of the fastest 33, however, starting on the tail of the field is the appropriate penalty in this instance.\u201d",
      "One year ago, Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and team owner Roger Penske \u2014 who also owns IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway \u2014 suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.",
      "Also suspended were managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and data engineer Robbie Atkinson.",
      "Cindric and Ruzewski will now miss their second consecutive Indy 500.",
      "\u201cAs far as I'm concerned, this case is closed,\u201d Boles said.",
      "Newgarden, who is trying to become the first driver in 109 years to win three consecutive Indy 500s, was a contender to win the pole. He was seen running off his anger in the infield of the speedway Sunday as another qualifying session roared on.",
      "Pato O\u2019Ward, who drives for rival Arrow McLaren, said after qualifying on the front row that IndyCar should have penalized the Penske cars by making them run in a last-chance qualifier to re-earn spots on the 33-car starting grid. He also expressed sympathy for the four drivers who had to compete for the final three spots with Jacob Abel missing the race.",
      "\u201cI feel bad for Abel and everybody who did the last-chance qualifying. Those cars weren\u2019t in regulation,\u201d O\u2019Ward said of the two Penske cars. \u201cThose cars should have been in the last-chance qualifier ... because they had that (Saturday), I guarantee you.\"",
      "O'Ward also openly wondered why Team Penske continues to push the envelope on rules.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\" he said. \"They\u2019re a great team. They have great drivers. Why are you doing that? It makes no sense.\u201d",

      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",

      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s not really about the books.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of top officials at the Library of Congress and equally sudden attempt to appoint a slate of loyalists as replacements has instead morphed into an enormous fight over the separation of powers, as the White House tries to wrest control of what has for centuries been a legislative institution.",
      "It\u2019s a power struggle with potentially vast consequences. The Library of Congress not only stores the world's largest collection of books but also an office overseeing reams of copyrighted material of untold value.",
      "There is a research institute that has long been protected from outside influence. Its servers house extremely sensitive information regarding claims of workplace violations on Capitol Hill, as well as payments and other financial data for the legislative branch\u2019s more than 30,000 employees. There\u2019s even speculation that the whole affair is tied to an ongoing debate over whether big tech companies can use copyrighted material for artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Because of this, the battle over control of the Library of Congress has prompted Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to deliver rare pushback against a president who has pressed to expand the boundaries of his own power to enact his priorities. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have been talking with the White House about a potential path to d\u00e9tente.",
      "This all has left the library in a bizarre state of purgatory.",
      "For now, Trump's choices for interim library leaders \u2014 most notably Todd Blanche, a deputy attorney general who had represented the president in his criminal proceedings \u2014 have not appeared to challenge the assertion by the library that one of its veteran officials would be the acting head. It would be unheard of for an executive branch official such as Blanche to simultaneously serve in the legislative branch, according to experts.",
      "\u201cThis egregious overreach into the legislature by the executive branch is just unwarranted and, we believe, unprecedented,\u201d said New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees the Library of Congress.",
      "The controversy began to unfold publicly last week, when Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden was fired in a terse email from a White House official. She had just one year left in her 10-year term.",
      "Then this week, Blanche was tapped by the White House to be the interim librarian, and two other Justice Department officials were chosen for other senior library posts. Those officials, Brian Nieves and Paul Perkins, tried unsuccessfully to enter the U.S. Copyright Office on Monday, but left voluntarily after library officials called Capitol Police.",
      "Thune told The Associated Press that Congress was \u201cnot entirely\u201d consulted ahead of Trump\u2019s dismissal of Hayden.",
      "Lawmakers want to ensure that \u201ccongressional legislative branch equities are protected,\u201d Thune said. He speculated that discussions with the White House to resolve the standoff would bleed into next week.",
      "The White House has said Trump was within his authority to dismiss Hayden, a former head of the library systems in Baltimore. It cited \u201cquite concerning\u201d behavior from Hayden involving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts as well as books for children that the White House found inappropriate.",
      "A copy of virtually every book published in the U.S. is sent to the Copyright Office, then the library decides whether to include it in the main collection. No one under 16 can get a reader card to access the collection.",
      "Existing regulations and past practices call for an acting librarian to come from the Library of Congress\u2019 current ranks if there is a vacancy. But the White House has argued that a law governing federal vacancies applies, even though the 1998 law deals with the executive branch, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
      "When Nieves and Perkins showed up on Monday, they held a letter that invoked the vacancies law to justify their appointments, according to one of the people.",
      "Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who leads the panel overseeing funding for the Library of Congress, argued that in practice, the librarian is not a legislative branch employee, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an appointment by the president of the United States, because we have to confirm her.\u201d",
      "Yet there is deep concern among lawmakers and aides about any unjustified intrusion of the administration into the Library of Congress and its operations.",
      "Especially worrisome to them is potential meddling with the Congressional Research Service, known as the nonpartisan think tank of Capitol Hill. It fields roughly 75,000 requests from members of Congress every year for research, legal expertise and other information critical for policymaking.",
      "The discussions between lawmakers and the Congressional Research Service are considered so sensitive that they are protected under the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being questioned -\u2013 such as in court -\u2013 about official legislative acts.",
      "The service's \u201cutility and trustworthiness would be substantially undercut if these inquiries were not protected or the Administration sought to shape responses to reflect its priorities,\u201d said Hope O\u2019Keeffe, a former associate general counsel at the Library of Congress.",
      "The library also oversees the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which functions as the human resources office of the legislative branch, fielding complaints about harassment, discrimination and other workplace violations. It also stores financial information about legislative branch employees, who include not just those at the Library of Congress, lawmakers and their aides, but employees of the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, told library staffers shortly after Hayden\u2019s firing that he will serve as the acting librarian. He said in a note this week that while the White House had appointed its own acting librarian, \u201cwe have not yet received direction from Congress about how to move forward,\u201d indicating that the library was defying Trump\u2019s wishes.",
      "California Sen. Alex Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, this week said flatly that Newlen is the acting librarian of Congress. Asked whether Blanche was respecting that, Padilla said, \u201cthat\u2019s my understanding.\u201d",
      "But a White House official stressed on Thursday that Trump selected Blanche to be the acting librarian. The official, granted anonymity because of the ongoing private discussions with lawmakers, said Trump chose Blanche because the president is \u201cappointing highly-qualified individuals who are wholeheartedly committed to advancing the America-first agenda.\" The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Some suspect that the Copyright Office is the true aim of the administration. Housed in the Library of Congress with a leader chosen by the librarian, the office accepts millions of copies of copyrighted material such as books, artwork and music every year as part of the copyright registration process.",
      "Shortly before the director of the office, Shira Perlmutter, was fired, her office released a report that questioned whether it was legal for the tech industry to use copyrighted material to \u201ctrain\u201d their artificial intelligence systems. Tech companies contend that doing so is legal when used for educational or research purposes or creating something new. Perlmutter\u2019s report said doing so, in some circumstances, would go beyond established boundaries of fair use when the AI-generated content is competing with creative works made by people.",
      "The material there is extremely valuable. For instance, copyright violation damages for the office's existing collection \u2014 if, for instance, tech companies scraped the material for AI purposes and then later were found liable for copyright infringement \u2014 would likely exceed $1.5 trillion, according to a person familiar with the calculations.",
      "Morelle noted that the firing came \u201cone day after, and I doubt there\u2019s any coincidence to this, a report which is in many ways at odds with what Elon Musk wants to do around intellectual property and copyright.\u201d Musk is the billionaire outside adviser for Trump who operates his own AI startup, called xAI. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, says an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d led its Grok chatbot to post unsolicited claims on social media about the persecution and \u201cgenocide\u201d of white people in South Africa",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company said an \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d to its chatbot Grok was the reason why it kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d on social media this week.",
      "An employee at xAI made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values,\u201d the company said in an explanation posted late Thursday that promised reforms.",
      "A day earlier, Grok kept posting publicly about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to users of Musk\u2019s social media platform X who asked it a variety of questions, most having nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "One exchange was about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name. Others were about video games or baseball but quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",
      "Computer scientist Jen Golbeck was curious about Grok's unusual behavior so she tried it herself before the fixes were made Wednesday, sharing a photo she had taken at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and asking, \u201cis this true?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe claim of white genocide is highly controversial,\" began Grok's response to Golbeck. \"Some argue white farmers face targeted violence, pointing to farm attacks and rhetoric like the \u2018Kill the Boer\u2019 song, which they see as incitement.\u201d",
      "The episode was the latest window into the complicated mix of automation and human engineering that leads generative AI chatbots trained on huge troves of data to say what they say.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\u201d said Golbeck, a professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\"",
      "Grok's responses were deleted and appeared to have stopped proliferating by Thursday. Neither xAI nor X returned emailed requests for comment but on Thursday, xAI said it had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation\u201d and was implementing new measures to improve Grok's transparency and reliability.",
      "Musk has spent years criticizing the \u201cwoke AI\u201d outputs he says come out of rival chatbots, like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, and has pitched Grok as their \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d alternative.",
      "Musk has also criticized his rivals' lack of transparency about their AI systems, fueling criticism in the hours between the unauthorized change \u2014 at 3:15 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday \u2014 and the company's explanation nearly two days later.",
      "\u201cGrok randomly blurting out opinions about white genocide in South Africa smells to me like the sort of buggy behavior you get from a recently applied patch. I sure hope it isn\u2019t. It would be really bad if widely used AIs got editorialized on the fly by those who controlled them,\u201d prominent technology investor Paul Graham wrote on X.",
      "Musk, an adviser to President Donald Trump, has regularly accused South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of being anti-white and has repeated a claim that some of the country\u2019s political figures are \u201cactively promoting white genocide.\u201d",
      "Musk's commentary \u2014 and Grok's \u2014 escalated this week after the Trump administration brought a small number of white South Africans to the United States as refugees, the start of a larger relocation effort for members of the minority Afrikaner group that came after Trump suspended refugee programs and halted arrivals from other parts of the world. Trump says the Afrikaners are facing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in their homeland, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government.",
      "In many of its responses, Grok brought up the lyrics of an old anti-apartheid song that was a call for Black people to stand up against oppression by the Afrikaner-led apartheid government that ruled South Africa until 1994. The song's central lyrics are \u201ckill the Boer\u201d \u2014 a word that refers to a white farmer.",
      "Golbeck said it was clear the answers were \u201chard-coded\u201d because, while chatbot outputs are typically random, Grok's responses consistently brought up nearly identical points. That's concerning, she said, in a world where people increasingly go to Grok and competing AI chatbots for answers to their questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a space where it\u2019s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they\u2019re giving,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really problematic when people \u2014 I think incorrectly \u2014 believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Musk's company said it is now making a number of changes, starting with publishing Grok system prompts openly on the software development site GitHub so that \u201cthe public will be able to review them and give feedback to every prompt change that we make to Grok. We hope this can help strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI.\u201d",
      "Among the instructions to Grok shown on GitHub on Thursday were: \u201cYou are extremely skeptical. You do not blindly defer to mainstream authority or media.\u201d",
      "Noting that some had \u201ccircumvented\u201d its existing code review process, xAI also said it will \u201cput in place additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can\u2019t modify the prompt without review.\u201d The company said it is also putting in place a \u201c24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grok\u2019s answers that are not caught by automated systems,\u201d for when other measures fail.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators will seek public comment on proposed changes from Microsoft for Teams, signaling the U.S. company may be nearing the end of a long-running antitrust case targeting its messaging and videoconferencing app.",
      "Microsoft had previously offered some modifications including unbundling Teams from its Office software suite in an attempt to head off the antitrust probe shortly after it was opened by the EU two years ago.",
      "But those proposals didn't satisfy the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s top competition enforcer, which accused Microsoft last year of potentially abusive behavior.",
      "The Commission said Friday that it will now seek feedback on fresh commitments Microsoft has made to resolve the competition worries. That includes making the Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software packages available at a discount without Teams, and letting customers switch between packages without Teams. The company is also promising to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams and for users to move their data from Teams to to competing products.",
      "The commission said in a press release that it \u201cinvites all interested parties to submit their views\" on Microsoft's proposals. If everyone is satisfied, they would become legally binding.",
      "The Redmond, Wash.-based company is \u201chopeful\u201d the Commission will \u201cin the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,\" Microsoft s vice president in charge of European government affairs, Nanna-Louise Linde, said in a blog post.",
      "Microsoft's commitments would be in force for up to 10 years, the Commission said. The company could incur fines worth up to 10% of its annual global revenues \u2014 which could run into tens of billions of euros \u2014 if it fails to honor them",
      "The Teams investigation dates back to 2020, when Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint.",
      "Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, alleged that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition \u2014 in violation of EU laws \u2014 by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.",
      "Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said the latest announcement \u201caffirms that Microsoft\u2019s anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy. We will carefully scrutinize Microsoft\u2019s proposed commitments.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The internet wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The internet wouldn't be the same without the Like button, the thumbs-up icon that Facebook and other online services turned into digital catnip.",
      "Like it or not, the button has served as a creative catalyst, a dopamine delivery system and an emotional battering ram. It also became an international tourist attraction after Facebook plastered the symbol on a giant sign on that stood outside its Silicon Valley headquarters until the company rebranded itself as Meta Platforms in 2021.",
      "A new book, \u201cLike: The Button That Changed The World,\" delves into the convoluted story behind a symbol that's become both the manna and bane of a digitally driven society.",
      "It's a tale that traces back to gladiator battles for survival during the Roman empire before fast-forwarding to the early 21st century when technology trailblazers such as Yelp co-founder Russ Simmons, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit were experimenting with different ways using the currency of recognition to prod people to post compelling content online for free.",
      "As part of that noodling, a Yelp employee named Bob Goodson sat down on May 18, 2005, and drew a crude sketch of thumbs up and thumbs down gesture as a way for people to express their opinions about restaurant reviews posted on the site. Yelp passed on adopting Goodson's suggested symbol and, instead, adopted the \u201cuseful,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d buttons conceived by Simmons. But the discovery of that old sketch inspired Goodson to team up with Martin Reeves to explore how the Like button came to be in their new book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something simple and also elegant because the Like button says, \u2018I like you, I like your content. And I am like you. I like you because I am like you, I am part of your tribe,\u2019 \u201d Reeves said during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cBut it's very hard to answer the simple question, \u2018Well, who invented the Like button?\u2019 \u201d",
      "Although Facebook is the main reason the Like button became so ubiquitous, the company didn't invent it and almost discarded it as drivel. It took Facebook nearly two years to overcome the staunch resistance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg before finally introducing the symbol on its service on February 9, 2009 \u2014 five years after the social network's creation in a Harvard University dorm room.",
      "As happens with many innovations, the Like button was born out of necessity but it wasn't the brainchild of a single person. The concept percolated for more than a decade in a Silicon Valley before Facebook finally embraced it.",
      "\u201cInnovation is often social and Silicon Valley was the right place for all this happen because it has a culture of meet-ups, although it's less so now,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEveryone was getting together to talk about what they were working on at that time and it turned out a lot of them were working on the same stuff.\u201d",
      "The effort to create a simple mechanism to digitally express approval or dismay sprouted from a wellspring of online services such as Yelp and YouTube whose success would hinge on their ability to post commentary or video that would help make their sites even more popular without forcing them to spend a lot of money for content. That effort required a feedback loop that wouldn't require a lot of hoops to navigate.",
      "And when Goodson was noodling around with his thumbs-up and thumbs-down gesture, it didn't come out of a vacuum. Those techniques of signaling approval and disapproval had been ushered into the 21st century zeitgeist by the Academy Award-winning movie, \u201cGladiator,\u201d where Emperor Commodus \u2014 portrayed by actor Joaquin Phoenix \u2014 used the gestures to either spare or slay combatants in the arena.",
      "But the positive feelings conjured by a thumbs up date even further back in popular culture, thanks to the 1950s-era character Fonzie played by Henry Winkler in the top-rated 1970s TV series, \u201cHappy Days.\u201d The gesture later became a way of expressing delight with a program via a remote control button for the digital video recorders made by TiVO during the early 2000s. Around the same time, Hot or Not \u2014 a site that solicited feedback on the looks of people who shared photos of themselves \u2014 began playing around with ideas that helped inspire the Like button, based on the book's research.",
      "Others that contributed to the pool of helpful ideas included the pioneering news service Digg, the blogging platform Xanga, YouTube and another early video site, Vimeo.",
      "But Facebook unquestionably turned the Like button into a universally understood symbol, while also profiting the most from its entrance into the mainstream. And it almost didn't happen.",
      "By 2007, Facebook engineers had been tinkering with a Like button, but Zuckerberg opposed it because he feared the social network was already getting too cluttered and, Reeves said, \u201cis he didn\u2019t actually want to do something that would be seen as trivial, that would cheapen the service.\u201d",
      "But FriendFeed, a rival social network created by Buchheit and now OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor, had no such qualms, and unveiled its own Like button in October 2007.",
      "But the button wasn't successful enough to keep the lights on at FriendFeed, and the service ended up being acquired by Facebook. By the time that deal was completed, Facebook had already introduced a Like button \u2014 only after Zuckerberg rebuffed the original idea of calling it an Awesome button \u201cbecause nothing is more awesome than awesome,\u201d according to the book's research.",
      "Once Zuckerberg relented, Facebook quickly saw that the Like button not only helped keep its audience engaged on its social network but also made it easier to divine people's individual interests and gather the insights required to sell the targeted advertising that accounted for most of Meta Platform's $165 billion in revenue last year. The button's success encouraged Facebook to take things even further by allowing other digital services to ingrain it into their feedback loops and then, in 2016, added six more types of emotions \u2014 \u201clove,\u201d \u201ccare,\u201d \u201chaha,\u201d \u201cwow,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d",
      "Facebook hasn't publicly disclosed how many responses it has accumulated from the Like button and its other related options, but Levchin told the book's authors that he believes the company has probably logged trillions of them. \u201cWhat content is liked by humans...is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet,\u201d Levchin said in the book.",
      "The Like button also has created an epidemic of emotional problems, especially among adolescents, who feel forlorn if their posts are ignored and narcissists whose egos feast on the positive feedback. Reeves views those issues as part of the unintentional consequences that inevitably happen because \u201cif you can\u2019t even predict the beneficial effects of a technological innovation how could you possibly forecast the side effects and the interventions?\u201d",
      "Even so, Reeves believes the Like button and the forces that coalesced to create it tapped into something uniquely human.",
      "\u201cWe thought serendipity of the innovation was part of the point,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can get bored with liking or having our capacity to compliment taken away so easily because it\u2019s the product of 100,000 years of evolution.\u201d",

      "A 29-year-old former tire shop manager who quit his job and cashed in his retirement savings to buy a sailboat has become a social media sensation as he sails from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix",
      "HONOLULU -- Midway while sailing across the Pacific with just his cat named Phoenix, Oliver Widger reflected on why he thinks his many followers \u2014 more than a million on TikTok and Instagram \u2014 are drawn to his story of quitting his 9-to-5 job and embarking on a journey from Oregon to Hawaii.",
      "\u201cThe world kind of sucks and, like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in how I felt with my work,\u201d Widger, 29, told The Associated Press on Wednesday via Zoom. \u201cYou can be making $150,000 a year and you still feel like you\u2019re just making ends meet, you know what I mean? And I think people are just tired of that and working really hard for nothing and want a way out.\"",
      "People are inspired by someone who found a way out, said Widger, who is among a growing number of people who have undertaken such voyages in recent years.",
      "Being diagnosed four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis made him realize he hated his job as a manager at a tire company, a job requiring him to be clean-shaven and wear pressed shirts. He heard about people who sailed from California to Hawaii and decided that was the life for him.",
      "He abruptly quit his job with \u201cno money, no plan\u201d and $10,000 of debt.",
      "\u201cI knew one thing: I'm buying a sailboat,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI'm sailing around the world.\u201d",
      "He liquidated his retirement savings, taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast, where he spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.",
      "Now, Widger is harnessing the power of social media to fund his round-the-world sailing dream.",
      "Since he set sail in April, followers have been tuning into his \u201cSailing with Phoenix\u201d social media posts to view videos of him and his feline first mate battling the waves and bouts of seasickness, enjoying dazzling sunsets, recounting tricky boat repairs or just reflecting on life at sea.",
      "As he discussed his journey with the AP, a netted bag carrying bottled water and snacks swung wildly over his head as the boat rocked.",
      "He recalled highlights of the voyage so far, including marveling at the speed dolphins cut through the water and finding flying fish on the deck. There have been stretches when there were no birds in sight for days. It can be a struggle to sleep when the boat is creaking while being buffeted by waves or to steady a boiling pot for the MREs he has been subsisting on.",
      "There have been harrowing moments like when a rudder failed and the boat tilted sideways in the surf for three hours as he made repairs, and the time he locked himself in the engine compartment and pried his way out with a wrench.",
      "Widger acknowledged he is relatively inexperienced as a sailor, but he has implemented safety measures and communication backup plans, including a satellite phone and an emergency beacon.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Jesse Harms of the U.S. Coast Guard in Hawaii hasn't been following the journey closely, but said he is relieved to hear Widger has the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, known as an EPIRB.",
      "It's a critical tool for rescuers to locate a mariner's position during an emergency, especially in the Pacific, the largest ocean, Harms said.",
      "Widger's journey provides a good opportunity to educate the public about sailing safety, such as the importance of wearing a personal flotation device whenever topside on the boat, monitoring the weather closely and registering emergency tools like the EPIRB, Harms said.",
      "\u201cThat's a really critical piece for anybody that's getting motivated by his story to go set off on their own adventure,\u201d Harms said.",
      "Until his arrival, likely in Honolulu, Widger is making sure everything is in place to avoid Phoenix having to undergo Hawaii's animal quarantine. A mobile vet will sign off on Phoenix's health when they arrive, he said.",
      "Widger wasn't aware of the deadly danger of cat feces to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, but he has been keeping all his trash, including kitty litter, on board. Even though he said he is legally allowed to throw it overboard, seeing so much plastic in the ocean motivates him not to.",
      "In addition to managing the practicalities of daily life on a boat, he is coping with going viral in the middle of the ocean by creating social media content and making decisions about merch his fans want to buy.",
      "He credits it all to his neck issue, which \u201cshook up my world and it changed my perspective on everything.\u201d He also hopes he can be an inspiration for anyone who's in a rut.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done I thought was impossible,\u201d Widger said. \"Sailing around the world is such a ridiculous dream. Whatever your dream is, just go, just do it.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans and VIPs can fly their way to venues at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics with the first air taxis ever to be used at a games.",
      "Archer Aviation\u2019s piloted electric air taxi known as Midnight will ferry up to four passengers from a vertiport takeoff and landing hub near a major venue about 10 to 20 minutes to their destination within the company\u2019s Los Angeles network.",
      "The planned network includes vertiports at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum south of downtown, which are slated to share opening and closing ceremonies. Other locations are Los Angeles International Airport, Hollywood, Santa Monica and Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America,\" Adam Goldstein, CEO and founder of Archer Aviation, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games.\u201d",
      "Archer says the air taxis produce less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter. The eVTOL aircraft is built with redundant, fault-tolerant systems, including 12 total engines and propellers, allowing Archer to target certification with the FAA at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners. The air taxis are made at the company's manufacturing plants in San Jose, California, and Covington, Georgia.",
      "As an official provider to the LA 2028 Olympics, Paralympics and Team USA, Archer also will use the air taxis to provide support for emergency services and security.",
      "\u201cOur vision is to fundamentally reimagine the Olympic and Paralympic Games experience,\" LA chairperson and president Casey Wasserman said. \u201cThis partnership represents an incredible opportunity to deliver something unprecedented.\u201d",

      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him",
      "A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.",
      "Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he\u2019s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.",
      "Knowing KJ\u2019s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.",
      "\u201cWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Nicole said.",
      "\u201cWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,\u201d her husband added.",
      "Within six months, the team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ\u2019s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA \u201cletter\u201d \u2014 also known as a base \u2014 to the correct type. Known as \u201cbase editing,\" it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cvery exciting\u201d that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.\u201d",
      "In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.",
      "While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, \u201che slept through the entire thing,\u201d recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.",
      "After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 \u00bd-month old also takes less medication.",
      "Considering his poor prognosis earlier, \u201cany time we see even the smallest milestone that he\u2019s meeting \u2013 like a little wave or rolling over \u2013 that\u2019s a big moment for us,\u201d his mother said.",
      "Still, researchers caution that it\u2019s only been a few months. They\u2019ll need to watch him for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,\u201d Ahrens-Nicklas said. \u201cBut every day, he\u2019s showing us signs that he\u2019s growing and thriving.\u201d",
      "Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.",
      "Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.",
      "Musunuru said his team\u2019s work \u2014 funded in part by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 showed that creating a custom treatment doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was \u201cnot far off\u201d from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.",
      "\u201cAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,\u201d Musunuru said.",
      "Scientists also won't have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research \u201csets the stage\u201d for treating other rare conditions.",
      "Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn't involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",
      "\u201cOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no time\" for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. \u201cThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because we\u2019re pretty much ready.\u201d",

      "All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence",
      "MEXICO CITY -- All of a sudden, women contacting one of the biggest sources of information about abortion in Mexico through the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp were met with silence.",
      "The nongovernmental organization\u2019s business account had been blocked. Weeks later, a similar digital blackout struck a collective in Colombia.",
      "Across the Americas, organizations that guide women seeking abortions in various countries are raising alarm, decrying what they see as a new wave of censorship on platforms owned by tech giant Meta \u2014 even in countries where abortion is decriminalized. The organizations believe this is due to a combination of changes to Meta policies and attacks by anti-abortion groups that denounce their content.",
      "While this also occurs on Instagram and Facebook, the blocking of organizations\u2019 verified WhatsApp business accounts, which they use to communicate with people seeking help, has been particularly disruptive. These accounts are crucial for communicating with people seeking help, and their blockage has significantly complicated daily interactions between women and support providers.",
      "Meta usually attributes its content blocking to policy violations, though it has acknowledged occasional mistakes. Since January, Meta changed the way it moderates content, now relying on user-generated notes \u201cto allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump has said the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d made in response to his threats over what conservatives considered a liberal bias in fact-checking.",
      "Among the organizations whose WhatsApp business accounts were suspended is the MSI Foundation (part of MSI Reproductive Choices, formerly Marie Stopes) a network working in Mexico for 25 years. Its account was suspended in February, and the Colombian group Ori\u00e9ntame, or Guide Me, which has worked in women's health in Colombia for decades, was labeled by Instagram as \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "While conservatives cheered the change in Meta moderation policies, organizations helping women who seek abortions say that, even if they just apply in the U.S., they often result in over-enforcement, likely driven by Artificial Intelligence, which disproportionately flags or removes their posts \u2014 obstacles that have increased since the start of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt is not always intentional censorship, but the outcome is still more censorship for us and our partners,\u201d said Martha Dimitratou, cofounder of Repro Uncensored, an organization that monitors digital suppression of reproductive health content.",
      "In additional comments on Thursday, Meta rejected any link between the groups\u2019 experiences and its policy changes.",
      "\u201cOur policies and enforcement regarding abortion medication-related content have not changed recently and were not part of the content moderation changes,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "\u201cFrom one day to the next they blocked communication between our users and women who need first-hand information\u201d to address doubts or look for medical follow-up with MSI, said Araceli L\u00f3pez-Nava, the organization\u2019s Latin America director.",
      "In the days after the suspension, appointments dropped 80%",
      "L\u00f3pez Nava said that MSI had previously faced issues with regular WhatsApp numbers, because it\u2019s easy to file complaints. So, the organization thought it would be different with a business account, which gives them a platform to manage the thousands of messages they receive every month.",
      "That wasn't the case. After an initial suspension, MSI's WhatsApp business account was permanently suspended two weeks later. The reason cited in Meta\u2019s notification? \u201cSending spam.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe argument is that they\u2019ve received complaints, but from whom?\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava asked. She said the organization can\u2019t be accused of sending spam because they only answer those who contact them and provide information in line with Mexican law. Abortion is decriminalized in Mexico at the federal level and in the majority of its 32 states.",
      "\u201cIt looks like an orchestrated strategy to us,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Nava said. \u201cAnd not necessarily by Meta.\"",
      "Dimitratou, who is also digital strategist for Canada-based Women on Web and the U.S.-based Plan C, said cases of blocked content have increased since Trump\u2019s election, not only in the U.S., but around the world, likely driven by anti-abortion groups.",
      "Conservative or religious groups have a history of attempting to leverage technology companies to obstruct abortion supporters\u2019 efforts, but the anonymity of app reporting prevents organizations from proving who is behind it.",
      "That is why MSI and an ally NGO, Women\u2019s Link Worldwide, have asked Meta to implement transparent mechanisms to be able to appeal the company\u2019s decisions and to respect international human rights standards. They have not received a response.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told The Associated Press that MSI's WhatsApp business account was blocked for valid reasons, saying that organizations receiving numerous negative comments receive warnings before suspension. Meta declined to provide details about the nature of the negative comments or comment on whether they could be coordinated by anti-abortion groups aiming to paralyze MSI.",
      "The Instagram accounts of Women on Web United States and Women on Web Latin America were suspended right after the U.S. presidential election in November, though they were later reinstated. Dimitratou said that Meta has also limited the organization\u2019s ability to place ads on accounts in Latin America, South Korea and West Africa.",
      "Repro Uncensored has documented at least 60 instances of similar digital censorship since January. The most recent occurred this week, when Thailand's TamTang Group said that Facebook had accused them of violating rules on selling medicines simply for sharing information about free abortion pills provided by the Thai government.",
      "A 2025 report by the California-based Center for Intimacy Justice, based on a survey of 159 nonprofits worldwide, found that major tech platforms were removing ads and content related to abortion and other women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health issues like menopause.",
      "When asked about the report, Meta downplayed its findings, noting that it was based on a small number of examples.",
      "Tech companies often cite policies against explicit or inappropriate sexual content or the advertisement of unsafe substances, such as abortion pills, even though the World Health Organization has said they\u2019re safe.",
      "In April, months after Meta announced changes to ensure greater freedom of expression, Ori\u00e9ntame, the Colombian collective that offers reproductive health services, posted on Instagram a drawing of a heart and the phrase \u201cAbort without pain.\u201d The post was blocked with the explanation: \u201cDangerous people and organizations, photo removed.\u201d",
      "While Colombia legalized abortion in 2022, Ori\u00e9ntame experienced censorship of at least 14 of their posts on Instagram in April 2025. That same month, their WhatsApp business account was suspended, said Tatiana Mart\u00ednez, who manages their social media. Although the WhatsApp account was restored after a week, they worry it could happen again.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said this week that the Instagram posts were mistakenly taken down and not the result of a change in its content standards.",
      "Ori\u00e9ntame director Mar\u00eda Vivas says the organization has been battling Google for years over online content limitations. The tech giant said in a message to the AP that it only restricts content when it violates policies. But Google keeps Colombia on the list of countries with restrictions on abortion ads \u2014 even though abortion was decriminalized there in 2022.",
      "As for their problems with Meta, Vivas said they started in late 2024, when the company started to make some data management adjustments.",
      "Taking legal action against tech giants, when each country has its own laws, is complicated. As a result, affected organizations have turned to creative strategies, like operating multiple backup accounts, having a substitute ready when one is blocked and reformulating language in posts to avoid censorship triggers.",
      "\u201cIt feels like Meta is our boss,\u201d Vivas joked about the ongoing struggle with the tech giant over the basic right to provide health information. \u201cWe live to respond to Meta, to adapt ourselves to Meta,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's absurd.\u201d",

      "BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Thursday that the organization\u2019s procurement agency is cooperating with police investigating corruption and fraud allegations involving the purchase of military equipment.",
      "The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) helps the 32 members of the world\u2019s biggest security alliance and their partners to buy defense equipment and other security systems and support. NATO as an organization does not own any weapons.",
      "The European Union\u2019s criminal justice agency, Eurojust, said Thursday that it had provided support for a cross-border investigation into alleged corruption involving current and former NSPA employees. The investigation stretches to Spain and Luxembourg, where the NSPA is based.",
      "Rutte said that the NATO agency is \u201cworking very closely with all the relevant authorities, and obviously we will continue doing that. We want to get to the root of this.\u201d He spoke in Turkey where he was chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers.",
      "Belgian prosecutors said Wednesday that two suspects in the western region of Flanders had been taken in for questioning over the allegations. One was arrested, the other released. No names or details about them were provided.",
      "They said that the probe is focusing on possible \u201cirregularities\u201d in the awarding of contracts to defense companies to buy military equipment like ammunition and drones, which have become a decisive factor in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "The prosecutors suspect that agency employees might have given confidential information to the companies to help them win contracts, and that money may have been laundered through consultancy firms set up for the purpose.",
      "In a related case, Dutch prosecutors announced earlier this week that they had arrested a 58-year-old man from Rotterdam on corruption charges. The prosecution service did not release his name in line with their privacy rules, but said he was a former Dutch defense ministry civil servant who \u201cwas responsible for international purchase contracts.\u201d",
      "In a statement, prosecutors said the man is \u201csuspected of having taken bribes in 2023 regarding the awarding of purchase contracts, together with others partly outside the Netherlands.\u201d Two other suspects, who were not civil servants, were also arrested, the statement said. It did not provide further details.",

      "Different activities such as climbing, grasping or hammering place stress on different parts of our fingers. In response to repeated stress, our bones tend to thicken in those areas.",
      "To study how ancient humans used their hands, scientists used 3D scanning to measure and analyze the bone thickness of fingers.",
      "They focused on the fossil hands of two early human ancestor species recovered from excavations in southern Africa, called Australopithecus sediba and Homo naledi. The individuals lived around 2 million years ago and around 300,000 years ago, respectively.",
      "Both ancient human species showed signs of simultaneously using their hands to move around \u2013 such as by climbing trees \u2013 as well as to grasp and manipulate objects, a requirement to being able to make tools.",

      "Trump said Russia and Ukraine would \"immediately\" resume negotiations.",
      "LONDON -- Russia launched more than 100 drones into Ukraine following the conclusion of a phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Ukraine's air force said, and as the world waited for what Trump said would be an immediate resumption of peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine's air force wrote on Telegram that its forces shot down 35 of the 108 Russian drones launched into the country overnight, with a further 58 jammed or otherwise neutralized while in flight. The air force reported damage on the ground in four Ukrainian regions.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down eight Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "Cross-border drone exchanges occur near-nightly and have increased in size and sophistication throughout the 3-year-old war. Monday night's barrage came despite Trump's latest assurance that a peace deal between the two sides is possible, following a phone call with Putin that lasted two hours.",
      "\"I think something's going to happen,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after the call. \"It's a very, very big egos involved, I tell you, big egos involved. But I think something's going to happen. And if I thought that President Putin did not want to get this over with, I wouldn't even be talking about it because I'd just pull out.\"",
      "Despite the failure of peace talks to date -- including a chaotic meeting between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey, last week -- Trump still appeared confident of success.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social website on Monday, Trump said Russia and Ukraine will \"immediately\" start negotiations toward a ceasefire. Kyiv has repeatedly requested a full 30-day pause to the fighting to facilitate peace talks. The Kremlin has so far dodged the proposal.",
      "When questioned if he had asked Putin to meet with him during the call on Monday, Trump replied, \"Of course.\"",
      "\"I said, 'When are we going to end this, Vladimir?'\" Trump said. \"I said, 'When are we going to end this bloodshed, this, this bloodbath?' It's a bloodbath. And, I do believe he wants to end it.\"",
      "Putin's own statement showed no sign of concessions. \"Russia's position is clear,\" the president said in a statement to the media after the call. \"Eliminating the root causes of this crisis is what matters most to us,\" Putin said, per a Kremlin readout.",
      "Trump's threats of new sanctions on Russia do not appear to have pushed the Kremlin away from its maximalist war goals, which essentially equate to Ukrainian capitulation.",
      "Those demands include the annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions -- plus the retention of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014 -- Kyiv's demilitarization, a permanent block on Ukrainian accession to NATO and the \"denazification\" of the country -- a nebulous demand based on Russia's false representation of the Ukrainian government as a far-right dictatorship.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- with whom Trump also spoke on Monday -- has sought to present Kyiv as ready and willing to make peace, instead framing Putin as the key obstacle to Trump's desired deal.",
      "\"This is a defining time,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a post to Telegram on Monday. \"Now the world can see whether its leaders have the capacity to ensure an end to the war and the establishment of a real, lasting peace.\"",
      "\"I confirmed to President Trump that we in Ukraine are ready for a complete and unconditional ceasefire, as the United States, in particular, has been talking about,\" he continued.",
      "\"It is important not to dilute this offer. If the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions for that. Pressure on Russia will encourage it to make real peace -- this is obvious to everyone in the world,\" he said.",
      "\"We must ensure that Russia is prepared to hold such productive negotiations,\" Zelensyy wrote.\" It is very important for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the negotiations and achieving peace, because the only one interested in this is Putin.\"",
      "If Putin drags out or blocks real negotiations, Zelenskyy said, \"America and the whole world behave accordingly, including responding with additional sanctions. Russia must end the war that it started, and it can do so any day. Ukraine is always ready for peace.\"",

Now, I think, you know, to get to a stage nine, I think that, if you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine. There was nothing wrong with him. Well, he said -- if it's the same doctor, he said there was nothing wrong there. And that's being proven to be a sad situation,\" Trump said.",
      "\"In other words, there are things going on that the public wasn't informed. And I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor if it's the same, or even if it's two separate doctors,\" he said. \"Why wasn't the cognitive ability, why wasn't that discussed? And I think the doctor said he's just fine. And, it's turned out that's not so. It's very dangerous. Look, this is no longer politically correct. This is dangerous for our country,\" Trump said.",

      "Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",
      "Biden's office also said the cancer had metastasized, spreading to his bones.",
      "Although some people were left wondering why the cancer was caught only after reaching a Gleason score of 9, oncology experts told ABC News that it's not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced or spread.",
      "\"Prostate cancer is something that we always hope screening will identify early, when the cancer is all still inside the prostate,\" Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and a member of the board of directors of the no-profit Zero Prostate Cancer, told ABC News.",
      "\"Even if we screen everybody perfectly, there will never be 100% detection of prostate cancer because, in truth, cancer does not follow a rule book,\" Morgans continued. \"And just because we are trying to catch it early doesn't mean it necessarily is present when we screen.\"",
      "PSA levels may not have been checked",
      "One screening test for prostate cancer involves a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigens, which are proteins made by cells in the prostate gland.",
      "Although there is no cutoff level that clearly indicates the presence of cancer, many doctors use a cutoff of 4 nanograms per milliliter to recommend further tests with a urologist, according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "For an advanced form of cancer like Biden's, a recent PSA test would have likely shown elevated levels.",
      "However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older due to harms such as false positives leading to more tests or a diagnosis of problems that would not have caused symptoms or death.",
      "Morgans said it's unclear what the former president and his doctor discussed regarding screening, but it's plausible that he did not undergo PSA screening.",
      "\"It is absolutely possible that President Biden, like so many men over that age, have decided to stop doing PSA screening because they've decided that it is not consistent with their overall health goals and wishes, and that is completely reasonable,\" Morgans said.",
      "Cancer could have grown rapidly",
      "Morgans said some men in their 70s and 80s do still undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer based on conversations with their primary care physicians and what's right for them.",
      "Even so, it's possible that the results were normal -- either due to a false negative or because their cancer was not present at the time, she said.",

      "Screening results could have been borderline",
      "Dr. Alan Bryce, chief clinical officer for City of Hope Cancer Center Phoenix, said there may be some patients who receive PSA screening results showing borderline-high results who decide not to pursue further testing.",
      "\"There are absolutely scenarios where that conversation happens with a patient or their family member,\" Bryce told ABC News. \"All of them might say, 'You know what? Given where we're at in life, we're not that worried about this. Let's go ahead and wait another year.'\"",
      "Bryce, a medical oncologist specializing in prostate and testicular cancers, added that shared decision-making is important when it comes to deciding if a patient wants to pursue prostate cancer screening -- and if they want to test further following test results that are abnormal.",
      "\"As physicians, we present patients with options and recommendations but, at the end of the day, it's still the patient's decision,\" he said. \"So, it's entirely possible that a conversation happens and the patient decides they don't want to proceed with further workup. Maybe they don't want to do a scan, maybe they don't want to do a biopsy.\"",
      "No symptoms present",
      "Advanced prostate cancer can present symptoms such as a weak urination stream; needing to urinate more often; erectile dysfunction; fatigue; weight loss; loss of bladder or bowel control; and pain in the ribs, hips and spine when the cancer had spread to the bones, according to the ACS.",

I certainly don't understand how it could have spread outside of my prostate,'\" Morgans said. \"It is very common for people to be completely asymptomatic.\"",
      "Bryce added that some symptoms, such as difficulty urinating or a weak urination stream, may be due to an enlarged prostate, which is common in older men.",
      "\"It is entirely normal that in older men, there is a degree of urinary obstruction that just happens with age,\" he said. \"It's entirely possible that a man just has normal symptoms associated with aging and nothing about it stands out as being related to a cancerous process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",
      "Biden's office said the cancer was diagnosed after \"increasing urinary symptoms\" and that it has metastasized, spreading to his bones.",
      "The statement added that the cancer is \"hormone-sensitive,\" which may allow for effective treatment options, which Biden and his family are reviewing.",
      "Here's what to know about prostate cancer including the signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed and how it is treated.",
      "What is prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer -- after skin cancer -- diagnosed in American men, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the nation's leading cancer advocacy organization.",
      "The prostate is found below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Most prostate cancers develop from gland cells in the prostate, which make fluid that is added to semen, the ACS said.",
      "Diagnosis rates have increased about 3% every year since 2014, according to ACS.",
      "It's estimated that about one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime.",
      "ACS estimates that there will be about 313,780 cases of prostate cancer and about 35,770 prostate cancer deaths in 2025.",
      "What are the signs and symptoms?",
      "Early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms but, when symptoms do occur, they include problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen, according to ACS.",
      "When prostate cancer is advanced, meaning it has grown larger or has metastasized, it can cause other problems including erectile dysfunction; weakness or numbness in the legs; loss of bladder or bowel control; weight loss; fatigue; or pain the ribs, hips or spine when the cancer has spread to the bones, ACS said.",
      "Dr. Maha Hussain, a prostate cancer expert and the Genevieve Teuton professor of medicine in the division of hematology-oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, told ABC News it is more common for prostate cancer to be found through regular annual exams than because of symptom occurrence.",
      "She added that many symptoms, such as frequent urination or difficulty passing urine, may not be due to prostate cancer but rather due to an enlarged prostate, which is common among older men.",
      "How to screen for prostate cancer",
      "Prostate cancer can often be found early through screening tests, which increases the odds of successful treatment.",
      "ACS recommends men speak with their health care provider about the decision to screen and to have those discussions at age 40 or 45 for those at high risk and at age 50 for those at average risk.",
      "One screening test involves a blood test that measures level of prostate-specific antigens (PSA), which are proteins made by cells in the prostate gland.",
      "Although there is no cutoff level that clearly indicates the presence of cancer, the ACS said many doctors use a cutoff of four nanograms per milliliter to recommend further tests with a urologist.",
      "Dr. Nitin Yerram, co-director of urologic oncology at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, said although PSA testing is a good tool, there are some pitfalls as well.",
      "\"Using PSA screening is like using a sledgehammer to hammer a small nail, so it's not very precise,\" he told ABC News. \"And PSA can be elevated for a variety of different reasons, whether it be inflammation, infection. Cancer is one of them, but [the test] doesn't differentiate between all of those.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, it is still a great tool, and it's very important for men with an elevated PSA to get further work up to help determine why that's elevated.\"",
      "Prostate cancer can also be tested for via digital rectal exam, which is when a physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel for bumps or hard areas on the prostate that indicate cancer, according to ACS.",
      "Patients may also undergo a prostate biopsy, which is when prostate cell samples are studied under a microscope to check for cancer.",
      "The National Cancer Institute said prostate biopsies can be assigned a Gleason score to determine how likely the cancer is to grow and spread. The score is determined by \"adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample,\" according to NCI.",
      "The Gleason score usually ranges from six to 10 with higher scores indicating a stronger likelihood of progression. President Biden's office said he received a Gleason score of nine.",
      "What are the treatment options?",
      "Treatment options for prostate cancer vary depending on what stage the cancer is in and how far it has spread.",
      "\"The good news is, nowadays, we have had significant improvement in the medical management of prostate cancer that has spread, and there's been significant prolongation of life, and so there are all kinds of different treatment options available for these patients,\" Hussain said.",
      "For prostate cancers that are small or localized to the prostate, doctors may recommend observation or active surveillance to monitor if symptoms are changing or if the cancer is starting to grow.",
      "Surgery and radiation therapy are the most common treatments for men who are classified as low or intermediate risk, experts told ABC News.",
      "For men whose cancer is more advanced, chemotherapy or hormone therapy -- the latter of which is also known as androgen deprivation therapy -- are most common.",
      "\"Testosterone, we know, is a driver of prostate cancer, and obviously all men have testosterone,\" Yerram said. \"And so central to an anti-androgen therapy plan is really to reduce the levels of testosterone to as close to zero as possible to help stop progression of that prostate cancer and to provide treatment.\"",
      "\"Specifically on President Biden, who obviously I'm not taking care of, but he has stage 4 cancer, so for him, anti-androgen therapy or chemotherapy will likely be first line for him,\" Yerram added.",
      "Experts said it is important for prostate cancer patients to follow up with their doctor after treatment to look for signs of cancer recurrence or treatment side effects.",
      "What are the survival rates?",
      "For localized or regional cancer, meaning the cancer is in the prostate or the cancer has spread to nearby structures, there is a five-year survival rate of more than 99%, according to ACS.",
      "For For cancers that have spread to other parts of the body such as lungs, liver, or bone, the five-year survival rate is about 37%, ACS said.",
      "Hussain said that although metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, it is very much treatable, and that survival rates have increased over the last three decades.",
      "\"We've really come a very, very long way in terms of how long patients are living,\" Hussain said. \"When I entered the field, let's say 1990, the average longevity with metastatic prostate cancer, roughly, was about two-and-a-half years. Now. we have more than doubled that and ... we have many men who are actually living even much longer in my practice over the years.\"",

      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",

He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",

      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",

      "Johnson doesn't have the votes at this time.",
      "It's crunch time in the House, where the next 48 hours will test Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership like never before as he scrambles to secure the needed votes to pass a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda.",
      "And now the president is set to attend the House GOP conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning, multiple White House officials confirmed to ABC News -- an effort to sway the holdouts.",
      "After Sunday night's successful vote to send the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" to the House Rules Committee, there are now two full intervening days for Johnson to put the final touches on the reconciliation bill and rally Republican support. And the pressure is on.",
      "Johnson doesn't have the votes at this time, given public concerns from conservatives and moderates alike. He can only lose three Republican members, so changes to the bill text are a certainty.",
      "The speaker on Monday expressed confidence in the House's consensus-building operation as lawmakers make modifications to the bill.",
      "\"It's been a bottom-up process -- that was what everybody wanted so we have delivered -- and we're almost there,\" he said. \"I'm very optimistic that we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered.\"",
      "Johnson's effort to unify the conference behind the bill is a major test of his speakership, and his ability to deliver for Trump, who has also encouraged Republicans to support it.",
      "Johnson worked over the weekend to sway Republican holdouts on the House Rules Committee to prevent blocking the legislation from moving out of the committee as they had on Friday. The hard-liners voted present on Sunday night to allow the bill to advance, but still haven't offered full-throated support for the bill.",
      "Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was \"willing to pick up the phone\" to encourage Republicans to fall in line on the bill -- but his Tuesday morning meeting with the entire Republican conference is a stronger message to those on the fence.",
      "Now, the Rules Committee is preparing for its hearing at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning -- and that meeting will set the parameters for floor debate. Meanwhile, negotiations inside the speaker's office will reach a fever pitch Monday and Tuesday as Republicans grapple over the sticking points -- primarily regarding Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions.",
      "\"Nothing is final until it's final,\" a senior House Republican leadership aide told reporters at a briefing Monday morning. \"It's a fragile process.\"",
      "Johnson on Monday downplayed perceived concerns that the GOP was dropping in last-minute changes to the legislation at this late stage in the process.",
      "\"We have a few issues to resolve -- and we are working with all parties to do that -- and I'm confident that we will,\" Johnson explained.",
      "Why meet at 1 a.m. on Wednesday? House Rules Chair Virginia Foxx let out a gentle laugh as she walked through the Capitol early Monday morning -- telling ABC News the timing must adhere to the House rules after the House Budget Committee voted late Sunday night to advance the bill.",
      "So what is the rule?",
      "\"Under the rules, Budget Dems get two calendar days to file minority views after [Sunday] night's markup,\" a Democratic aide explained. \"Rules then has a one-hour notice requirement, hence [the hearing] starting at 1 a.m.\"",
      "If the Rules Committee reports the reconciliation package favorably to the floor, that would keep Johnson's plans on schedule to hold a vote on passage on Thursday -- though he has threatened to hold the House in session this weekend if there are any hiccups along the way.",
      "Johnson is setting his sights on sending the package to Trump for his signature by the Fourth of July given a mid-July \"deadline\" to address the debt limit to avoid a default.",
      "As negotiations continue behind closed doors, Republican aides stress that \"95% of the bill is done\" while they scramble to lock down support. A round of changes are anticipated to address technical modifications at the urging of the Senate parliamentarian, who is scrubbing the bill text and signaled some legislative language may be fatal to reconciliation privileges in the Senate.",
      "\"Everything is on the table,\" a senior GOP aide said, stressing the fluidity of the overall discussions.",
      "House Republicans are still weighing potential changes to implementation dates for Medicaid work requirements, balancing what is \"feasible\" for states to implement against the angst of Republicans whose patience does not extend to 2029, beyond the Trump presidency, as it's currently written in the bill.",
      "\"We want to make sure that what we're intending to do is actually matching an ability to implement,\" a senior Republican aide said. \"And so an exact date is hard to say at this stage because I think we're still working through that.\"",
      "On SALT, aides said a resolution is \"not decided yet\" -- explaining that members are just returning to town after a three-day weekend and the speaker continues to work through it.",
      "Leavitt on Monday addressed a concern some of Republican holdouts expressed about the bill adding to the bloated national deficit, saying flatly that \"this bill does not add to the deficit.\"",
      "Republicans insist they're going to hit at least $1.5 trillion of savings with the bill while also reflecting Trump's agenda -- pointing at Congressional Budget Office's letter confirming that all 11 committees met their reconciliation instruction targets.",
      "\"This has been a year's worth of work to kind of figure out what are the priorities you want to instill. We started this a long time ago and worked towards it,\" an aide emphasized. \"We'll work through all the changes that we need to make here, and then we'll see where the final exact numbers shake out. But the bottom line is we had a framework set in the budget and we're going to get that.\"",
      "And as the clock ticks down, Johnson has rejected questions about the crunch time giving him \"heartburn.\"",
      "\"No, I don't have heartburn, because I know we are going to get this job done,\" Johnson said.",

    "summary": "Some of the policies enacted under the Trump administration will have lasting impacts on the environment far after the current president leaves office, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Clean water, clean air and scientific advances could be in jeopardy.",
      "Some of the policies enacted under the Trump administration will have lasting impacts on the environment far after the current president leaves office, some environmental policy experts told ABC News.",
      "President Donald Trump has enacted a sweeping number of policies that could potentially harm the environment and disable the country's ability to reach a net-zero emissions economy since taking office, these experts said.",
      "The executive orders include a declaration of a national energy emergency, expanding the mining and use of coal in the U.S. and removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time.",
      "The policies stem from the idea of U.S. independence or \"putting America first,\" the president's orders state.",
      "\"The United States must grow its economy and maintain jobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to protect the environment,\" Trump wrote in an Inauguration Day executive order titled \"Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements.\"",
      "The order continued, \"In recent years, the United States has purported to join international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country\u2019s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives.\"",
      "On March 6, the White House announced that deregulation efforts has saved more than $180 billion, about $2,100 per family of four, by halting proposed Biden-era regulations.",
      "\"Upon taking office, President Trump immediately blocked these proposed rules and has initiated an aggressive deregulatory agenda that requires substantial cuts in existing regulations for each new agency rule,\" the White House said. \"President Trump is committed to cutting senseless red tape that will lower costs, lead to higher growth, and usher America into its Golden Age.\"",
      "Some of these actions will be difficult to see through fruition, especially those focusing on increasing the production and use of fossil fuels as the rest of the world looks to convert their economies to run on clean energy, experts told ABC News.",
      "However, the campaigns against wind, energy, batteries, electric vehicle charging and energy efficiency will put the U.S. on a slower path to bringing global warming under control, John Holdren, a professor of environmental science and policy and former science adviser to President Barack Obama, told ABC News.",
      "\"That's going to cause enormous damage in itself,\" Holdren said.",
      "\"We have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are going to use it,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech in January. \"We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\"",
      "Deregulation of the Environmental Protection Agency is among the Trump administration's changes expected to have harmful impacts for decades to come, Holly Bender, chief program officer for the Sierra Club, an environmental nonprofit, told ABC News.",
      "On March 12, the EPA announced sweeping moves to walk back environmental protections and eliminate a host of climate change regulations, described by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin as the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.\"",
      "Among the 31 actions include rolling back emission regulations on coal, oil and gas production and reevaluating government findings that previously determined that greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet and are a threat to public health.",
      "These actions are reversing policies that have \"broad public support,\" such as funding the replacement of lead pipes, reducing mercury pollution in air and water and rolling back protections for public lands, Bender said.",
      "\"This is the agency where they're setting standards for toxic and hazardous air pollutants, like dioxin or mercury, for which there is no safe level of exposure,\" Bender said.",
      "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 invested billions in cleaning up legacy pollution, strengthening the country's water infrastructure and increasing resources to help businesses reduce toxic pollutants, with a focus on underserved and overburdened communities.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, the EPA said, \"While the Biden EPA repeatedly attempted to usurp the Constitution and the rule of law to impose its 'Green New Scam,' the Trump EPA is laser-focused on achieving results for the American people while operating within the limits of the laws passed by Congress.\"",
      "\"We believe protecting human health and the environment doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of creating jobs and Powering the Great American Comeback,\" the EPA spokesperson said. \"We can and will deliver on both. EPA has wasted no time advancing President Trump\u2019s directive to deliver clean air, land, and water for all Americans \u2013 while restoring common-sense, accountability, and cooperative federalism to environmental policy. In lockstep with the President\u2019s agenda, EPA is also helping to unleash American energy, pursue permitting reform, make America the AI capital of the world, and bring back American auto jobs.\"",
      "Staffing reductions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could have reverberating impacts on how meteorologists across the country forecast the weather, the experts who spoke to ABC warned.",
      "NOAA and the National Weather Service, which is a part of NOAA, are responsible for both routine and extreme weather forecasting nationwide \u2013 tracking hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, tsunamis and other potentially life-threatening events",
      "But some research laboratories, regional offices and satellite operations facilities have shuttered as a result of staffing cuts, the agency has announced in recent months.",
      "Essential function such as satellite information, weather and its effect on airplane engine health, come from these offices, said Craig McLean, former NOAA director of research, during a news conference in March. The cuts will lead to significant consequences for weather forecasting accuracy, sea navigation, the fishing industry and air safety",
      "Apart from forecasting, climate adaptation will be impacted too, Holdren said. The country's ability to adapt to the damage caused by more extreme heat waves, flooding, drought, wildfires, hurricanes and sea level rise could be compromised as a result of staffing reductions within NOAA.",
      "\"The slowing of those adaptation efforts is going to increase the harm from those extremes associated with climate change well beyond the time that Trump is in office,\" Holdren said.",
      "A draft budget proposal by the Office of Management and Budget suggested a potential 27% reduction \u2014 about 27% \u2014 in NOAA's funding for the 2026 fiscal year.",
      "It's unclear whether there will be sufficient staffing left at any number of regional forecast offices to continue 24/7 operations, with positions that usually staff the 122 NWS forecast offices, 13 River Forecast Centers, and two tsunami warning centers eliminated, said National Weather Service Employees Organization General Counsel Richard Hirn in March.",
      "Thousands of positions at federal government agencies that perform crucial scientific research have been eliminated -- including the EPA, NASA, NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service -- with the launching of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative by the Trump administration to cut federal spending and maximize government productivity.",
      "The cuts extend widely across engineering and science and will result in a lack of scientific advances and international competitiveness stemming from the U.S., which will have lasting cultural and economic impacts as well, Holdren said.",
      "\"It's the lifeblood of the innovation that over the years, since World War II, has given the United States not only the world's strongest economy, but the most productive agriculture, the most robust environmental protection, the most capable military,\" he said. \"You can't expect the private sector to replace these big cuts in fundamental research.\"",
      "Philanthropic organizations will do their best to fill in the gaps, but they don't have enough funding and have other priorities that may take precedence, Holdren added.",
      "Even if \"a more sensible\" administration follows, it will take years to rebuild the capabilities for fundamental search in universities and national laboratories -- both from a recruitment and equipment standpoint, Holdren said. The U.S. will likely experience a weakened scientific and technological workforce as a result.",
      "\"We're already seeing some of the most senior and talented people leaving the country and going elsewhere -- going to Canada, going to France, going to China -- where they perceive that they will be better able to pursue their skills and apply them to productive purposes,\" Holdren said.",
      "DOGE claims it has saved taxpayers a total of $170 billion as a result of the cuts, with the EPA ranking as No. 6 on the \"Agency Efficiency Leaderboard,\" which appears to list the Top 10 agencies that have saved the most money.",
      "Environmental attorneys and activists have been gearing up to fight any policies the Trump administration enacts since the presidential election in November.",
      "\"We have the tools to fight,\" Bender said.",

      "The court approved the administration\u2019s emergency request to lift a lower court\u2019s order that barred it from ending the protections while other legal proceedings continue.",
      "In their application to the high court, lawyers representing the government had said the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California undermined \u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\u201d when it halted the administration from ending protections and work permits in April 2025 as opposed to the original date in October 2026.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the court's decision a \"win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "\"The Biden Administration exploited parole programs to let poorly vetted migrants into this country -- from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers. The Trump Administration is reinstituting integrity into our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe,\u201d they added.",

      "\u201cThis is the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history. That the Supreme Court authorized this action in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking,\" Arulanantham said. \"The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court\u2019s decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations.\u201d",
      "The decision leaves hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants who participated in the legal process of applying and then receiving TPS asking themselves if they are in the country legally and whether they can go into work tomorrow.",

Definitely, one reading of the decision is that the 350,000 Venezuelan TPS holders from the 2023 cohort have just lost their status and employment authorization right now,\u201d Arulanantham said during a news conference Monday afternoon.",
      "It\u2019s also possible that TPS holders have protection for a few more days, but the Supreme Court did not make it clear, leading Arulanantham to blast its decision as \u201ccallous.\u201d",

If you're going to make decisions that affect the lives of so many people, you at least owe it to the world and to them to explain what it is that you're doing and when decision is going to take effect,\u201d he said.",
      "Days before leaving office, the Biden administration announced an 18-month extension of TPS benefits for Venezuelans who obtained the status in 2023. It had created protected status for Venezuelans, in part, because conditions in Venezuela under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro made it risky to deport migrants there.",
      "But three days after being confirmed in February, DDHS Secretary Kristi Noem vacated the decision.",
      "In its lawsuit, the National TPS Alliance and seven Venezuelan nationals accused Noem\u2019s decision to vacate the extension as being motivated \u201cat least in part by racial animus\u201d toward Venezuelans. The lawsuit claims Noem has repeatedly called Venezuelans \u201cdirtbags\u201d and gang members during news interviews.",

      "The ruling might have major repercussions for hundreds of thousands of other people. At the moment, DHS\u2019 termination of TPS for Haiti, Cameroon, and Afghanistan is being challenged in courts across the country with similar arguments as those for Venezuela.",

      "As a fan, Shaun Horne is all about Detroit\u2019s professional sports teams",
      "DETROIT -- As a fan, Shaun Horne is all about Detroit's professional sports teams. But when it comes to playing, the high school junior has his eyes on one game.",
      "\u201cI only play golf,\u201d Horne said after taking his turn on a simulator inside a gym on Detroit's westside.",
      "Embracing golf makes the 16-year-old a rarity among his Detroit peers \u2014 particularly Black high schoolers.",
      "Coaches and community groups in the city are taking ambitious steps to spread the game's popularity among students \u2014 noting that only about 50 of more than 14,000 high school students in Detroit's school district play golf on school teams.",
      "In Detroit, the biggest challenge is exposing Black youth to the game, said Jesse Hawkins, who is Black and coaches Horne\u2019s team at Renaissance High School. Backing from local corporations and nonprofits, providing access to equipment and even college scholarships is helping.",
      "\u201cWhen you go into high schools and you go into elementary schools often times we\u2019ll hear narratives around basketball players, football games, those things,\u201d Hawkins said. \"And golf is really not as propagated as much for our community.\u201d",
      "In Detroit, advocates of increasing play among Black young people have partnered with some of the city's largest businesses and community organizations. At least two nonprofits offer programs that teach kids how to play golf.",
      "The Rocket Classic has steered nearly $10 million from the annual PGA event held in Detroit to local charitable organizations. Of that, $800,000 has been given to programs that teach kids how to play the game. One program provides access to college scholarships to high school seniors, while upward of 700 children and teens take part each year in programs put on by First Tee of Greater Detroit.",
      "\u201cGolf is the why we get them there, but while we have them there we\u2019re teaching them life skills,\u201d said Carl Bentley, chief executive of First Tee of Greater Detroit, which has donated a golf simulator to the school district. \u201cLearning how to say \u2018yes sir, yes ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2014 shake a hand properly, how to start a conversation. We\u2019re teaching them life skills and then we get to putting and swinging and things like that.\"",
      "Among the 28.1 million Americans who played golf on a course in 2024, about 25% were Black, Asian or Hispanic, according to the National Golf Foundation. Interest is wider when considering those who played or followed professional golf coverage on TV, in writing or via podcasts.",
      "But Hawkins said his experience as a coach suggests Black high schoolers aren't among that audience.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t hear kids talking about the latest golf shoes or the cool golf apparel,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily going to get a badge of honor walking into your high school and you\u2019ve got the newest golf shirt.\u201d",
      "Golf and equipment can be pricey, sometimes too pricey for families struggling just to make ends meet.",
      "Detroit, which is just under 80% Black, had a median income of about $39,500 in 2023 compared to $69,100 statewide, according to the census. The city\u2019s poverty level was about 32%. Statewide, that figure was about 13.5%.",
      "A set of good golf clubs can cost a few hundred dollars or more. It's $28 for juniors to play 18 holes and use a cart weekdays at the two public golf courses in Detroit.",
      "The PGA brought its first event to Detroit in 2019, and city native Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies has been its sponsor. The company works with partners to bring the game to Detroit\u2019s youth and cover some of the costs, said Trina Scott, vice president of Civic and Community Affairs at Detroit-based Rock, which is Gilbert\u2019s family office.",
      "\u201cHow do we attract Black and brown youth into seeing (golf) as a possibility?\u201d said Scott. \u201cOne way of doing that is by making it accessible (and) also eliminating the barriers \u2014 being able to have the right clothing to go on a golf course, being able to have the clubs that you need, being able to have the skillset to be confident on the course.\u201d",
      "Mike Schuchard has about a dozen players on his Detroit Cass Tech golf team. That's about double the number from last season, but only two are considered \u201cvarsity level.\"",
      "That\u2019s not enough to compete against some suburban schools with strong golf programs.",
      "The first-year golf coach says he's trying to recruit students who are already interested in others sports.",
      "\u201cThese schools are loaded with great athletes, but they just haven\u2019t been introduced to this game, yet,\" Schuchard said.",
      "Ahmari Flowers, the senior captain on Cass Tech's golf team, agrees. He started playing the sport after his freshman year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an athletic guy and golf like came easy to me,\" said Flowers, 17. \"For an athletic person, it\u2019s still a sport, a lot of body movement and all you got to do is control that athleticism and use it to your advantage.\u201d",

      "A Texas man is facing execution for the burning death of an elderly clerk he set ablaze during a store robbery more than a decade ago",
      "HOUSTON -- A Texas man is facing execution Tuesday evening for the burning death of an elderly clerk he set on fire during a convenience store robbery more than a decade ago.",
      "Matthew Lee Johnson was condemned for the 2012 death of 76-year-old Nancy Harris, a great-grandmother who was splashed with lighter fluid and set ablaze at a store in Garland, a northeast suburb of Dallas.",
      "Johnson, 49, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection after 6 p.m. CDT at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "His was one of two executions scheduled for Tuesday in the U.S. In Indiana, Benjamin Ritchie was set to receive a lethal injection for the 2000 killing of a police officer.",
      "These two executions are part of a group of four scheduled within about a week\u2019s time. On May 15, Glen Rogers was executed in Florida. On Thursday, Oscar Smith is scheduled to receive a lethal injection in Tennessee.",
      "David Dow, one of Johnson's attorneys, said he would not be pursuing any final appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to stop the execution. Lower appeals courts had previously rejected requests by Johnson's lawyers to stay his execution. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied Johnson\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In prior appeals, Johnson\u2019s lawyers had argued his death sentence was unconstitutional because he was improperly determined to be a future danger to society, a legal finding needed to sentence him to death. His most recent appeals had argued his execution date had been illegally scheduled.",
      "Security video captured part of the attack against Harris.",
      "Badly burned, she was able to describe the suspect before she died several days after the May 20, 2012, attack. Johnson\u2019s execution is scheduled to take place 13 years to the day Harris was attacked.",
      "Johnson\u2019s guilt has never been in doubt. At his 2013 trial, he admitted to setting Harris on fire. He expressed remorse and called himself \u201cthe lowest scum of the earth.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hurt an innocent woman. I took a human being\u2019s life. I was the cause of that. It was not my intentions to -- to kill her or to hurt her, but I did,\u201d said Johnson.",
      "Johnson said he had not been aware of what he had done as he had been high after smoking $100 worth of crack. His attorneys told jurors that Johnson had a long history of drug addiction and had been sexually abused as a child.",
      "In court documents, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said Johnson's various appeals have been efforts to delay a legal death sentence.",
      "\u201cThirteen years after the commission of Johnson\u2019s crime, justice should no longer be denied,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in a court petition filed last week.",
      "Harris had worked at the convenience store for more than 10 years, living only about a block and a half away, according to testimony from her son, Scot Harris. She had four sons, 11 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris had only been working her Sunday morning shift for a short time when Johnson walked in, poured lighter fluid over her head and demanded money.",
      "After Johnson grabbed the money from the register, he set Harris on fire and calmly walked out the store, according to court documents. Harris frantically tried to extinguish herself and her clothing, exiting the store and screaming for help before a police officer used a fire extinguisher to douse the flames covering her body. Johnson was arrested about an hour later.",
      "Harris suffered extensive second- and third-degree burns over her head and face, neck, shoulders, upper arms, and leg and was in a great deal of pain in the days before she died, a nurse and doctor testified.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Johnson would be the fourth person put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state. If both of Tuesday\u2019s executions take place, that would bring this year\u2019s total to 18 death sentences carried out nationwide.",

      "New York\u2019s governor plans to visit the Seneca Nation to formally apologize for the state\u2019s role in running an upstate boarding school that separated Native American students from their families and forced them to assimilate into American society",
      "NEW YORK -- New York\u2019s governor plans to visit the Seneca Nation on Tuesday to formally apologize for the state\u2019s role in running an upstate boarding school that separated Native American students from their families with the goal of assimilating them into American society.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul is also expected to meet with survivors of the Thomas Indian School, which operated from 1875 to 1957 in western New York near Lake Erie.",
      "Seneca President J. Conrad Seneca, whose father attended the school, said the apology is overdue. He said his family and countless others have quietly borne their pain for generations.",
      "\u201cThe atrocities that our children suffered at the Thomas Indian School have remained hidden in the shadows for far too long,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the visit. \u201cAt long last, our people will hear, directly from the Governor, the words we have waited lifetimes for the State of New York to say \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re sorry\u2019.\u201d",
      "But some tribe members are skeptical of the goodwill gesture.",

      "\u201cAn apology is one thing,\u201d she said by phone ahead of the visit. \u201cWhat actions is she going to take in acknowledging this? These traumas are still impacting our communities.\u201d",
      "Originally established by Presbyterian missionaries in 1855 before the state took ownership in 1875, the Thomas Indian School was among more than 400 government-supported schools established throughout the country with the goal of assimilating Native American youths.",
      "But the schools, which operated for roughly 150 years, had a devastating impact on Native American communities. Staff at the schools worked to strip Native children of their traditions and heritage. Teachers and administrators cut their hair, forbade them from speaking their own languages and forced them into manual labor.",
      "Students, forcibly separated from their families, endured torture, sexual abuse and hatred from school officials. More than 900 children died at the schools, the last of which closed or transitioned into different institutions decades ago.",
      "Former President Joe Biden in October 2024 visited the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to formally apologize to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of the nation\u2019s government-run boarding school system.",
      "But at least $1.6 million in federal funds destined for research projects on the boarding schools have been among the casualties of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to rein in the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tribe officials say Hochul\u2019s visit appears to be the first by a sitting New York governor to the federally recognized tribe\u2019s lands.",
      "\u201cNo words or actions will ever be able to undo the pain and suffering of the Seneca people and other Indigenous peoples across the State, but by visiting the Seneca Nation and the site of the Thomas Indian School we will mark a new day in our relations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement Friday.",
      "Matthew Hill, a tribe member whose father was among the last class of students before the school was shuttered, dismissed the visit as \u201cempty words.\u201d",
      "After all, he said, the Hochul administration and the tribe have been negotiating for years over how much if any of the tribe\u2019s casino revenues the state should be allowed to collect.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re saying sorry for the school, but they\u2019ll continue extorting money from us in the form of gaming revenues,\u201d said Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has confirmed real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.",
      "Charles Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation after discovering his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, hiring a prostitute and arranging to have the encounter recorded with a hidden camera and sent to his own sister, the man\u2019s wife.",
      "Kushner, who was confirmed 51-45, is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. His son Jared is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka. When he announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner in November, Trump called him \u201ca tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.\u201d",
      "Charles Kushner will head to France as the relationship between the two traditional allies, and between the U.S. and the rest of Europe, has been strained over Trump\u2019s trade policies and the U.S. role in the Ukraine war. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Kushner said he would work closely with France to \u201cbring greater balance to our important economic relationship\u201d and also encourage France to \u201cinvest more in its defense capabilities, as well as lead the EU to align with the U.S. vision of increased European commitments to security.\u201d",
      "As Trump has rattled traditionally solid relationships with European allies, Kushner said he appreciates the history between the two countries and is \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship.\" He told senators that he is a child of Holocaust survivors who came to the United States after World War II, and his grandmothers and other members of his family were executed by Nazis.",
      "New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Kushner that his nomination comes at a \u201ccritical time\u201d because \u201cour European allies are anxious.\u201d",
      "Shaheen also asked Kushner about his criminal past. He replied that he made a \u201cvery, very, very serious mistake, and I paid a very heavy price for that mistake.\u201d",
      "Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts, including tax evasion and witness tampering. It was the highest sentence he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie called it \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d he ever prosecuted as U.S. attorney.",
      "Kushner also agreed to pay $508,900 to the FEC for violating contribution regulations by failing to obtain an OK from partners to whom more than $500,000 in contributions were credited.",
      "Announcing Kushner's pardon in 2020, Trump\u2019s first White House cited Kushner\u2019s more recent charitable work as the reason he deserved clemency.",
      "\u201cThis record of reform and charity overshadows Mr. Kushner\u2019s conviction and 2 year sentence for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation, and making false statements\u201d to the Federal Election Commission, the White House said then.",
      "Kushner was confirmed with the support of one Democrat \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. In his prepared testimony for his confirmation hearing, Kushner thanked Booker for his \u201cspecial and close friendship.\u201d",

      "SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras -- The United States sent 68 immigrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their countries Monday on the first government-funded flight of what the Trump administration is calling voluntary deportations.",
      "In the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, 38 Hondurans, including 19 children, disembarked from the charter flight carrying $1,000 debit cards from the U.S. government and the offer to one day be allowed to apply for legal entry into the U.S.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to increase deportations substantially. Experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return, but unlikely to spur high demand. The offer has been paired with highly-publicized migrant detentions in the U.S. and flying a couple hundred Venezuelan migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "Kevin Antonio Posadas, from Tegucigalpa, had lived in Houston for three years, but had already been considering a return to Honduras when the Trump administration announced its offer.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see my family and my mom,\u201d said Posadas, who added that the process was easy.",
      "\u201cYou just apply (through the CBP Home app ) and in three days you\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. The flight left Houston early Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s good because you save the cost of the flight if you have the intention of leaving.\u201d",
      "Posadas said he hadn\u2019t feared deportation and liked living in the U.S., but had been thinking for some time about going home. He said eventually he would consider taking up the U.S. government\u2019s offer of allowing those who self-deport to apply to enter the United States legally.",
      "In a statement about the flight Monday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \u201cIf you are here illegally, use the CBP Home App to take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home. If you don\u2019t, you will be subjected to fines, arrest, deportation and will never be allowed to return.\u201d",
      "Twenty-six more migrants aboard the flight were headed home to Colombia, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security statement.",
      "Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garc\u00eda said the Honduran government would also support the returning migrants with $100 cash and another $200 credit at a government-run store that sells basic necessities.",
      "Among the migrants arriving voluntarily Monday were four children who were born in the United States, Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Garc\u00eda, who met the arriving migrants at the airport, said they told him that being in the U.S. without documents required for legal immigration or residence had been increasingly difficult, that things were growing more hostile and they feared going to work.",
      "Still, the number of Hondurans deported from the U.S. so far this year is below last year\u2019s pace, said Honduras immigration director Wilson Paz.",
      "While about 13,500 Hondurans have been deported from the U.S. this year, the figure stood at more than 15,000 by this time in 2024, Paz said.",
      "He didn\u2019t expect the number to accelerate much, despite the Trump administration\u2019s intentions.",
      "Some would continue applying to self-deport, because they feel like their time in the U.S. is up or because it\u2019s getting harder to work, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be thousands of people who apply for the program,\u201d Paz said. \u201cOur responsibility is that they come in an orderly fashion and we support them.\u201d",

      "Deputy Alfredo \u201cFreddy\u201d Flores died April 20 after enduring third-degree burns across most of his body and a period of medical complications, six months after the fire on Oct. 10, 2023. He was performing a mandatory firearm recertification inside a trailer that serves as a mobile shooting range when it caught on fire at the department's Pitchess Detention Center about 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.",
      "Another deputy with him was also seriously injured. Flores was participating in firearms qualification which the department requires deputies to do once a quarter, Sheriff Robert Luna said in October 2023.",
      "His family filed a lawsuit suit seeking damages for constitutional violations, negligence and product liability, alleging the fire started because officials failed to properly maintain the mobile gun range.",
      "The LA County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the sheriff's department allowed a \u201cdangerous accumulation of unburned gunpowder residue, lead, propellant, and/or other combustible material\u201d which ignited suddenly to start the fire.",
      "According to the lawsuit, there are well-documented prior instances of fires in mobile shooting ranges in California as well as other ranges operated by the LA County Sheriff's Department. There is also \u201cdocumentation of violations\u201d by the department related to unsafe practices in the operation and maintenance of its mobile shooting ranges, the suit said.",
      "The family is also seeking relief from Inveris Training Solutions, the manufacturer of the trailer. Mobile Inveris shooting ranges are \u201cdefectively designed\u201d and have a high risk of fires from a buildup of the combustible material that isn't properly cleaned and ventilated, the lawsuit said.",
      "The suit asks for injunctive relief to stop the county's operations of its mobile gun ranges, compensation for damages as well as civil penalties.",
      "Flores was a deputy for 22 years and his assignments included the North County Correctional Facility and Altadena Station. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons.",

      "Researchers are deploying a new weapon to slow the spread of invasive spotted lanternflies",
      "CLEVELAND -- The spotted lanternfly, a leaf-hopping invasive pest first detected in the U.S. a decade ago, has steadily spread across the East Coast and into the Midwest with little getting in its way.",
      "But now researchers are deploying a new weapon to slow it's advance \u2014 specially trained dogs with the ability to sniff out the winged insect's eggs before they hatch.",
      "Since late last year, four of the dogs have been scouring parks in the Cleveland area in search of egg masses hidden around trees, shrubs, park benches, landscape rocks and bridge pillars. Each egg mass can produce 30 to 50 spotted lanternflies.",
      "So far, the dogs have uncovered more than 4,000 of the masses, meaning they've helped eradicate as many as 200,000 of the sap-sucking bugs that damage grapes, fruit trees, hops and hardwoods, said Connie Hausman, senior conservation science manager at Cleveland Metroparks.",
      "In just a few hours in April, the dogs found about 1,100 egg masses at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Hausman said.",
      "Not just any dog can go out searching, she said.",
      "\u201cThey all have wonderful noses, but they're not all eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had to pass tests to prove their service.\u201d",
      "The dogs were trained through a research project led by a group at Virginia Tech University, which is setting out to slow the spread of the insects that are native to eastern Asia and recognizable for their distinctive black spots and bright red wing markings.",
      "The four working in Cleveland owned by local residents already had scent training before they worked with Virginia Tech to hone their noses to detect the spotted lanternflies.",
      "Once they spot a new mass of eggs, the dogs get a treat from their handlers who scrape away the mud-like masses.",

    "story": [
      "The sheriff who oversees the New Orleans jail where 10 men escaped last week says defective locks were a key factor in the jailbreak",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Just days before 10 men broke out of a New Orleans jail, officials with the sheriff's office asked for money to fix faulty locks and cell doors deemed a key factor in the escape.",
      "As the manhunt for the remaining seven fugitives stretches into a new week, officials continue to investigate who or what was to blame in a jailbreak that even the escapees labeled as \u201ceasy\u201d \u2014 in a message scrawled on a wall above the narrow hole they squeezed through.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has long raised concerns about the jail's ongoing \u201cdeficiencies,\" adding that the breakout has \u201conce again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades\u201d to the ailing infrastructure.",
      "The men yanked open a cell door, slipped through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed wire fence and fled from the jail early Friday, recorded surveillance video showed.",
      "While Hutson said the locks played a key role in the escape, there are other crucial security lapses that officials have outlined; Indications that the escape may have been an inside job, with three sheriff\u2019s employees now on suspension; the hole that officials said may have been formed using power tools; a lack of monitoring of the cell pod, as the employee tasked with the job had stepped out to grab food; and law enforcement not being aware of the escape until a morning headcount seven hours after the men fled.",
      "Attorney General Liz Murrill said on Monday that state and local officials, courts and law enforcement are working together to hastily address issues at the ailing jail.",
      "Murrill said it's \"not a secret\u201d that the jail had been experiencing staffing shortages and maintenance defects for years.",
      "The sheriff's office says it has long raised concerns about issues at the jail. As recently as four days before the escape, Jeworski \u201cJay\u201d Mallet \u2014 the Chief of Corrections for the Orleans Justice Center \u2014 presented a need for a new lock system during the city's Capital Improvement Plan hearing.",
      "Mallet said the current system at the jail, which houses around 1,400 people, was built for a \u201cminimum custody type of inmate.\"",
      "But he classified many at the jail as \u201chigh security\u201d inmates who are awaiting trials for violent offenses, including charges such as murder, assault and rape. He said many require a \u201crestrictive housing environment that did not exist\" at the jail and, as a result, the sheriff's office has transferred dozens in custody to more secure locations.",
      "In the aftermath of the escape, Murrill said officials are looking at ways to \u201charden physical aspects of this prison so that we can be realistic about the population that is being held there.\u201d",
      "Mallet said some cell unit doors and locks have been \u201cmanipulated\" to the point that they can't even be closed properly.",
      "Since becoming sheriff in 2022, Hutson said she has complained about the locks at every turn and advocated for additional funding to make the facility more secure.",
      "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said during a news conference on Sunday that funding for the jail has been \u201ca priority\u201d and that funding has been allocated to the sheriff's office for operating expenses and capital improvements. Bianka Brown, the chief financial officer for the sheriff's office, said the current budget \u201cdoesn't support what we need\u201d to ensure critical fixes and upgrades.",
      "\u201cThings are being deprived,\" Brown said of the jail, which for more than a decade has been subject to federal monitoring and a consent decree intended to improve conditions. The jail, which opened in 2015, replaced another facility that had its own history of escapes and violence.",
      "Other's have pointed to Hutson being at fault. State Rep. Aimee Adatto Freeman, who represents much of uptown New Orleans, called for sheriff to step down on Monday.",
      "\u201cRather than take accountability, she\u2019s pointed fingers elsewhere,\u201d Freeman wrote in a statement. \u201cBlaming funding is a deflection--not an excuse.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry recently announced the state is launching an investigation into who is responsible in the escape. He also directed the state\u2019s Department of Corrections to conduct an audit of the jail\u2019s compliance with basic correctional standards.",
      "The governor also requested an inventory of pre-trial detainees or those awaiting sentencing in violent cases at the facility, to consider moving them into state custody.",
      "Three of the seven inmates still at large late Monday were convicted of or are facing second-degree murder charges, authorities said.",

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- A vanishing species of whale gave birth to few babies this birthing season, raising alarms among scientists and conservationists who fear the animal could go extinct.",
      "The whale is the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers only about 370 and has declined in population in recent years. The whales give birth to calves off the southeastern United States from mid-November to mid-April, and federal authorities have said they need to have at least 50 calves per season to start recovering.",
      "The whales didn't come anywhere near that number this year. The calving season produced only 11 mother-calf pairs, scientists with the New England Aquarium in Boston said.",
      "The lack of baby whales underscores the need for protection of the whales, conservationists said Monday. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in marine fishing gear and collisions with large ships.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re also reproducing more slowly than they used to,\u201d said the International Fund for Animal Welfare in its calving season report card. \"This is likely due to stress from entanglements, navigation amongst busy maritime traffic, increasing ocean noise, and the changing distribution of their food sources.\"",
      "The calving season did have some bright spots. Several females gave birth for the first time, and that gives hope for the future, the aquarium said in a statement. The whale population only has about 70 reproductive females left.",
      "\u201cWith past calf counts ranging from 39 to zero, we never know how any calving season will unfold. While the calf count is relatively low this year, I am encouraged by four new mothers being added to the reproductive pool,\u201d said Philip Hamilton, senior scientist in the Aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.",
      "The whales can weigh up to 150,000 pounds (45,360 kilograms) and were heavily exploited during the era of commercial whaling. They've been protected for decades, but have been slow to recover.",
      "In recent years, scientists have said the whales have strayed from established protected zones in search of food, and that has put them at elevated risk of entanglements and collisions. The whales migrate migrate from the south to New England and Canada to feed on tiny ocean organisms.",

      "A husband and wife are set to go on trial in federal court in Denver over what federal prosecutors have said was a stunt to help elect the first Black mayor of Colorado Springs",
      "DENVER -- In the run-up to the 2023 mayoral election in Colorado Springs, a racial slur was scrawled across a Black candidate\u2019s sign and a cross set on fire in front of it.",
      "It was a stunt to generate sympathy and support for the Black candidate, Yemi Mobolade, prosecutors have said, but two people accused of staging it are set to go on trial Monday, charged with making a threat against him.",
      "Mobolade, the city's first Black mayor, is scheduled to testify in the case as a victim, according to court documents.",
      "But one of the defendants claims Mobolade himself was a participant in the plan to help him win. And the defendant\u2019s attorneys say their alleged actions were political theater \u2014 free speech that is constitutionally protected and wasn\u2019t meant to cause harm.",
      "\"This was a hoax in every sense of the word,\u201d defendant Ashley Blackcloud told The Associated Press. She said Mobolade knew in advance about their plans to burn the cross, but she would not comment further, citing a court order that bars discussing information gathered in the case before the trial. Blackcloud, who is indigenous and Black, said the stunt was not intended to hurt anyone.",
      "Mobolade has previously denied any involvement emphatically. A city spokesperson, Vanessa Zink, said the mayor did not want to want to make any additional comment.",
      "The second defendant \u2014 Blackcloud\u2019s husband, Derrick Bernard \u2014 is serving a life sentence after being convicted last year of ordering the killing of a rapper in Colorado Springs. The man charged with carrying out the killing was recently acquitted, and Bernard is appealing his conviction.",
      "Messages left for Blackcloud's lawyer and Bernard's lawyer were not returned.",
      "However, in motions to dismiss the case they pointed out that the cross was set on fire in the middle of the night, which no one other than the defendants apparently saw.",
      "They are, however, accused of spreading word about it in emails to the media and others that include images of the scene.",
      "They are each charged with using a means of interstate commerce \u2014 the internet and email \u2014 to make a threat and conveying false information about an attempt to intimidate Mobolade with a fire. They are also both charged with being part of a conspiracy to do that. They have pleaded not guilty.",
      "According to jury instructions in the case, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bernard and Blackcloud intended Mobolade to fear that violence would result in order for them to be found guilty.",
      "Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Regina M. Rodriguez ruled that the alleged actions are not ones that are clearly protected by the First Amendment, which would have required her to dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cIt is up to the jury to determine whether the cross burning was a true threat or merely political speech,\u201d she wrote.",
      "A third person indicted in the alleged scheme, Deanna West, pleaded guilty in March to one count of being part of a conspiracy to set the fire and then spread false information about it, under a plea agreement with prosecutors. According to that agreement, West's lawyer and government prosecutors agreed that the conspiracy\u2019s goal was to interfere in the campaign of Mobolade\u2019s opponent and create the belief that Mobolade was being discouraged from running because of his race.",
      "West is also scheduled to testify for the government.",
      "According to the indictment, Bernard communicated with Mobolade before the cross burning on April 23, 2023, and after Mobolade won election in a May 6, 2023, runoff.",
      "About a week before the cross burning, Bernard told the then-candidate in a Facebook message that he was \u201cmobilizing my squadron in defense and for the final push. Black ops style big brother. The klan cannot be allowed to run this city again.\u201d",
      "They spoke for about five minutes on the telephone three days after the incident.",
      "In a video statement posted on social media in December, Mobolade said he had fully cooperated with the investigation and had been truthful with law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI fully and truthfully cooperated throughout this investigation. I had no knowledge, warning or involvement in this crime,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for Colorado, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment on whether it had questioned or investigated Mobolade about whether he was involved in the cross burning.",

      "As the U.S. government begins reinstating international students\u2019 records following an expansive crackdown, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives",
      "After the government terminated his legal status in the U.S., one student abruptly lost his laboratory job in Houston and, fearing detention, he returned to his home country in south Asia on a one-way ticket.",
      "The Trump administration later reversed course in its expansive crackdown on international students, but there was a major obstacle. The student cannot return because his American visa was revoked.",
      "Without it, he\u2019s \u201cstranded,\u201d said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "As the government begins reinstating students' records, many face a daunting and complicated path toward rebuilding their lives. For those who left, there is no guarantee they can return. Others have faced challenges reenrolling in school and returning to jobs.",
      "Mental anguish from their ordeals linger, as do feelings of vulnerability. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has expanded the grounds for terminating a student\u2019s legal status, leaving many to fear they could be targeted again.",
      "A total of more than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring, with little notice or explanation. In court hearings, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects and people who have been arrested, even if they were never charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "At a court hearing last week in Oakland, California, lawyers for international students sought a nationwide injunction they said would protect their clients and others across the country.",
      "But government attorneys said that wasn't necessary because ICE was mailing status reactivation letters to affected students. It likely will take two weeks for all students to receive their letter, which can then be shared with universities and employers, assistant U.S. attorney Elizabeth Kurlan said.",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers said the letter is meaningless, arguing ICE\u2019s new policy suggests student records can be terminated on a whim. There's also no evidence ICE has asked the State Department to restore revoked visas, the plaintiffs' attorneys said.",
      "The man in Houston left within about a week of learning his legal status had been terminated. Around that time, he also received an email that the visa he used to enter the U.S. had been revoked. He believes his termination stemmed from a 2021 fraud case that was dismissed.",
      "Over nearly a decade he had built a life in the U.S., where he was enrolled in \u201coptional practical training,\u201d which allows foreign students to stay and work for up to three years on their student visas. In his home country, he is now looking for work and living with his mother.",
      "The wait time for a U.S. visa interview is at least a year, he said.",
      "Even if he got another visa, returning would be complicated because of his financial situation. He had a car loan and credit cards in the U.S. that he can\u2019t afford to pay after losing his job, and his credit score has since dropped, he said.",
      "\u201cRevoking a visa or revoking a SEVIS status does not just affect the educational side of things, it affects the whole life,\u201d said the student, who has struggled with feelings of loneliness and also grief over his father's recent death.",
      "SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students\u2019 compliance with their visa status.",
      "Students who left the country may not have known their rights or had the resources to hire a lawyer, said Ben Loveman, an immigration attorney. They now will have a harder time being reinstated, he said.",
      "\u201cThere were huge consequences,\u201d Loveman said.",
      "For a Nepali programmer in Texas who had his status terminated, the ordeal brought up a mistake he thought he had left in the past.",
      "The programmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear or retaliation, was arrested four years ago for drunken driving. He said he took responsibility for his actions, performing community service hours, serving probation and paying fines. The judge told him the records could be sealed after two years, but the case appears to explain why he was targeted by immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cI followed everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to take it all, at least give me due process.\u201d",
      "His status has since been restored, and the programmer, who is on an OPT program, has gone back to his job. But the episode hasn\u2019t faded from his mind.",
      "If the right opportunity emerged in another country like New Zealand or Canada, he said he would take it and leave.",
      "A student at Iowa State University who also requested anonymity out of concern about being targeted, said he is looking for options to leave the U.S., after what he describes as a \u201cdark period.\u201d",
      "The Ph.D. student said his status termination pushed him to a mental breaking point. He had a plane ticket back home to Bangladesh reserved. He hardly left his apartment, and when he did, he felt he was being followed.",
      "He attributes his termination to pending charges against him for marijuana possession, but he said he hadn't been convicted.",
      "After his status reinstatement, he restarted a teaching assistant job he had lost. Then, he had to catch up on grading almost three weeks of assignments for dozens of students.",
      "While he's relieved to get back to school, he's confident about his decision to leave by the end of the year \u2014 either for home or Europe. The degree is not worth the risk of another status termination, he said.",

      "The Bibb County Sheriff's Office was investigating the fatal shooting of three people who were killed at the Midtown Daiquiri Bar and Grill in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday around 12 a.m. Bibb County coroner Leon Jones identified the victims as Jedarrius Meadows Jr, 28; Javonta Faulks, 32; and Javarsia Meadows, 24.",
      "All three men were pronounced dead at the bar, according to a statement from the sheriff's office. An email seeking additional comment was sent to the department Sunday. Deputies were investigating the shootings.",
      "Less than 24-hours earlier, a 25-year-old man was fatally shot at a graduation party on a residential block, the sheriff's department said. That victim was identified as Jaurice Markel Haywood, according to the Bibb County coroner. Two other men were injured and transported to a local hospital, including a 24-year-old man who was in critical condition.",
      "The sheriff's department didn't say whether anyone had been arrested in connection with either of the shootings.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has been pushing back against certain court rulings it doesn't like in the hundreds of cases filed against it in the past few months",
      "DENVER -- Tucked deep in the thousand-plus pages of the multitrillion-dollar budget bill making its way through the Republican-controlled U.S. House is a paragraph curtailing a court\u2019s greatest tool for forcing the government to obey its rulings: the power to enforce contempt findings.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the bill can pass the House in its current form \u2014 it failed in a committee vote Friday \u2014 whether the U.S. Senate would preserve the contempt provision or whether courts would uphold it. But the fact that GOP lawmakers are including it shows how much those in power in the nation's capital are thinking about the consequences of defying judges as the battle between the Trump administration and the courts escalates.",
      "Republican President Donald Trump raised the stakes again Friday when he attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for its ruling barring his administration from quickly resuming deportations under an 18th-century wartime law: \u201cTHE SUPREME COURT WON\u2019T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\u201d Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social.",
      "The most intense skirmishes have come in the lower courts.",
      "One federal judge has found that members of the administration may be liable for contempt after ignoring his order to turn around planes deporting people under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump's administration has scoffed at another judge\u2019s ruling that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, even though the Supreme Court upheld that decision.",
      "In other cases, the administration has removed immigrants against court orders or had judges find that the administration is not complying with their directives. Dan Bongino, now Trump's deputy director of the FBI, called on the president to \u201cignore\u201d a judge\u2019s order in one of Bongino's final appearances on his talk radio show in February.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s going to arrest him? The marshals?\u201d Bongino asked, naming the agency that enforces federal judges\u2019 criminal contempt orders. \u201cYou guys know who the U.S. Marshals work for? Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "The rhetoric obscures the fact that the administration has complied with the vast majority of court rulings against it, many of them related to Trump's executive orders. Trump has said multiple times he will comply with orders, even as he attacks by name judges who rule against him.",
      "While skirmishes over whether the federal government is complying with court orders are not unusual, it's the intensity of the Trump administration's pushback that is, legal experts say.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me they are walking as close to the line as they can, and even stepping over it, in an effort to see how much they can get away with,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect from a very clever and mischievous child.\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, whose Article III Project pushes for pro-Trump judicial appointments, predicted that Trump will prevail over what he sees as hostile judges.",
      "\u201cThe more they do this, the more it's going to anger the American people, and the chief justice is going to follow the politics on this like he always does,\u201d Davis said.",
      "The clash was the subtext of an unusual Supreme Court session Thursday, the day before the ruling that angered the president. His administration was seeking to stop lower courts from issuing nationwide injunctions barring its initiatives. Previous administrations have also chafed against national orders, and multiple Supreme Court justices have expressed concern that they are overused.",
      "Still, at one point, Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer over his assertion that the administration would not necessarily obey a ruling from an appeals court.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d asked Barrett, who was nominated to the court by Trump.",
      "Sauer contended that was standard Department of Justice policy and he assured the nation\u2019s highest court the administration would honor its rulings.",
      "Some justices have expressed alarm about whether the administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown-Jackson, both nominated by Democratic presidents, have warned about government disobedience of court orders and threats toward judges. Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by a Republican president, George W. Bush, issued a statement condemning Trump's push to impeach James E. Boasberg, the federal judge who found probable cause that the administration committed contempt by ignoring his order on deportations.",
      "Even after the Supreme Court upheld a Maryland judge\u2019s ruling directing the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the White House account on X said in a post: \u201che's NOT coming back.\u201d",
      "Legal experts said the Abrego Garcia case may be heading toward contempt.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis has complained of \u201cbad faith\u201d from the administration as she orders reports on what, if anything, it\u2019s doing to comply with her order. But contempt processes are slow and deliberative, and, when the government\u2019s involved, there\u2019s usually a resolution before penalties kick in.",
      "Courts can hold parties to civil litigation or criminal cases in contempt for disobeying their orders. The penalty can take the form of fines or other civil punishments, or even prosecution and jail time, if pursued criminally.",
      "The provision in the Republican budget bill would prohibit courts from enforcing contempt citations for violations of injunctions or temporary restraining orders \u2014 the two main types of rulings used to rein in the Trump administration \u2014 unless the plaintiffs have paid a bond. That rarely happens when someone sues the government.",
      "In an extensive review of contempt cases involving the government, Yale law professor Nick Parrillo identified only 67 where someone was ultimately found in contempt. That was out of more than 650 cases where contempt was considered against the government. Appellate courts reliably overturned the penalties.",
      "But the higher courts always left open the possibility that the next contempt penalties could stick.",
      "\u201cThe courts, for their part, don\u2019t want to find out how far their authority goes,\u201d said David Noll, a Rutgers law professor, \u201cand the executive doesn\u2019t really want to undermine the legal order because the economy and their ability to just get stuff done depends on the law.\u201d",
      "Legal experts are gaming out whether judges could appoint independent prosecutors or be forced to rely on Trump\u2019s Department of Justice. Then there\u2019s the question of whether U.S. marshals would arrest anyone convicted of the offense.",
      "\u201cIf you get to the point of asking the marshals to arrest a contemnor, it\u2019s truly uncharted territory,\u201d Noll said.",
      "There\u2019s a second form of contempt that could not be blocked by the Department of Justice \u2013- civil contempt, leading to fines. This may be a more potent tool for judges because it doesn\u2019t rely on federal prosecution and cannot be expunged with a presidential pardon, said Justin Levitt, a department official in the Obama administration who also advised Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cShould the courts want, they have the tools to make individuals who plan on defying the courts miserable,\u201d Levitt said, noting that lawyers representing the administration and those taking specific actions to violate orders would be the most at risk.",
      "There are other deterrents courts have outside of contempt.",
      "Judges can stop treating the Justice Department like a trustworthy agency, making it harder for the government to win cases. There were indications in Friday's Supreme Court order that the majority didn't trust the administration's handling of the deportations. And defying courts is deeply unpopular: A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 8 in 10 Americans say that if a federal court rules a Trump administration action is illegal, the government has to follow the court\u2019s decision and stop its action.",
      "That's part of the reason the broader picture might not be as dramatic as the fights over a few of the immigration cases, said Vladeck, the Georgetown professor.",
      "\u201cIn the majority of these cases, the courts are successfully restraining the executive branch and the executive branch is abiding by their rulings,\u201d he said.",

      "Sweeping research cuts in President Donald Trump's proposed budget would target an ocean-monitoring system that scientists say is crucial to predicting tsunami escape routes and hurricane intensity and helping ships navigate dangerous harbors safely",
      "Capt. Ed Enos makes his living as a harbor pilot in Hawaii, clambering aboard arriving ships in the predawn hours and guiding them into port.",
      "His world revolves around wind speeds, current strength and wave swells. When Enos is bobbing in dangerous waters in the dark, his cellphone is his lifeline: with a few taps he can access the Integrated Ocean Observing System and pull up the data needed to guide what are essentially floating warehouses safely to the dock.",
      "But maybe not for much longer. President Donald Trump wants to eliminate all federal funding for the observing system's regional operations. Scientists say the cuts could mean the end of efforts to gather real-time data crucial to navigating treacherous harbors, plotting tsunami escape routes and predicting hurricane intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last thing you should be shutting down,\u201d Enos said. \u201cThere\u2019s no money wasted. Right at a time when we should be getting more money to do more work to benefit the public, they want to turn things off. That\u2019s the wrong strategy at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\u201d",
      "The IOOS system launched about 20 years ago. It's made up of 11 regional associations in multiple states and territories, including the Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington state, Michigan, South Carolina and Southern California.",
      "The regional groups are networks of university researchers, conservation groups, businesses and anyone else gathering or using maritime data. The associations are the Swiss army knife of oceanography, using buoys, submersible drones and radar installations to track water temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, wave speeds, swell heights and current strength.",
      "The networks monitor the Great Lakes, U.S. coastlines, the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the Gulf of America, the Gulf of Alaska, the Caribbean and the South Pacific and upload member data to public websites in real time.",
      "Cruise ship, freighter and tanker pilots like Enos, as well as the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, use the information directly to navigate harbors safely, plot courses around storms and conduct search-and-rescue operations.",
      "The associations' observations feed into National Weather Service forecasts. The Pacific Northwest association uses tsunami data to post real-time coastal escape routes on a public-facing app. And the Hawaii association not only posts data that is helpful to harbor pilots but tracks hurricane intensity and tiger sharks that have been tagged for research.",
      "The associations also track toxic algal blooms, which can force beach closures and kill fish. The maps help commercial anglers avoid those empty regions. Water temperature data can help identify heat layers within the ocean and, because it\u2019s harder for fish to survive in those layers, knowing hot zones helps anglers target better fishing grounds.",
      "The regional networks are not formal federal agencies but are almost entirely funded through federal grants through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The current federal budget allocates $43.5 million for the networks. A Republican bill in the House natural resources committee would actually send them more money, $56 million annually, from 2026 through 2030.",
      "A Trump administration memo leaked in April proposes a $2.5 billion cut to the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, in the 2026 federal budget.",
      "Part of the proposal calls for eliminating federal funding for the regional monitoring networks, even though the memo says one of the activities the administration wants the commerce department to focus on is collecting ocean and weather data.",
      "The memo offered no other justifications for the cuts. The proposal stunned network users.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to build an incredible system and it\u2019s running smoothly, providing data that\u2019s important to the economy. Why would you break it?\u201d said Jack Barth, an Oregon State oceanographer who shares data with the Pacific Northwest association.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re providing is a window into the ocean and without those measures we frankly won\u2019t know what\u2019s coming at us. It's like turning off the headlights,\" Barth said.",
      "NOAA officials declined to comment on the cuts and potential impacts, saying in an email to The Associated Press that they do not do \u201cspeculative interviews.\u201d",
      "Nothing is certain. The 2026 federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1. The budget must pass the House, the Senate and get the president's signature before it can take effect. Lawmakers could decide to fund the regional networks after all.",
      "Network directors are trying not to panic. If the cuts go through, some associations might survive by selling their data or soliciting grants from sources outside the federal government. But the funding hole would be so significant that just keeping the lights on would be an uphill battle, they said.",
      "If the associations fold, other entities might be able to continue gathering data, but there will be gaps. Partnerships developed over years would evaporate and data won't be available in a single place like now, they said.",
      "\"People have come to us because we\u2019ve been steady,\" Hawaii regional network director Melissa Iwamoto said. \u201cWe\u2019re a known entity, a trusted entity. No one saw this coming, the potential for us not to be here.\u201d",

      "Libraries across the United States are cutting back on e-books, audiobooks and loan programs after the Trump administration suspended millions of dollars in federal grants as it tries to dissolve the Institute of Museum and Library Services.",
      "Federal judges have issued temporary orders to block the Trump administration from taking any further steps toward gutting the agency. But the unexpected slashing of grants has delivered a significant blow to many libraries, which are reshuffling budgets and looking at different ways to raise money.",
      "Maine has laid off a fifth of its staff and temporarily closed its state library after not receiving the remainder of its annual funding. Libraries in Mississippi have indefinitely stopped offering a popular e-book service, and the South Dakota state library has suspended its interlibrary loan program.",
      "E-book and audiobook programs are especially vulnerable to budget cuts, even though those offerings have exploded in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cI think everyone should know the cost of providing digital sources is too expensive for most libraries,\" said Cindy Hohl, president of the American Library Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous and growing need.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump issued an executive order March 14 to dismantle the IMLS before firing nearly all of its employees.",
      "One month later, the Maine State Library announced it was issuing layoff notices for workers funded through an IMLS grant program.",
      "\u201cIt came as quite a surprise to all of us,\u201d said Spencer Davis, a library generalist at the Maine State Library who is one of eight employees who were laid off May 8 because of the suspended funding.",
      "In April, California, Washington and Connecticut were the only three states to receive letters stating the remainder of their funding for the year was cancelled, Hohl said. For others, the money hasn\u2019t been distributed yet. The three states all filed formal objections with the IMLS.",
      "Rebecca Wendt, California state library director, said she was never told why California's funding was terminated while the other remaining states did not receive the same notice.",
      "\u201cWe are mystified,\u201d Wendt said.",
      "The agency did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Most libraries are funded by city and county governments, but receive a smaller portion of their budget from their state libraries, which receive federal dollars every year to help pay for summer reading programs, interlibrary loan services and digital books. Libraries in rural areas rely on federal grants more than those in cities.",
      "Many states use the funding to pay for e-books and audiobooks, which are increasingly popular, and costly, offerings. In 2023, more than 660 million people globally borrowed e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines, up from 19% in 2022, according to OverDrive, the main distributor of digital content for libraries and schools.",
      "In Mississippi, the state library helped fund its statewide e-book program.",
      "For a few days, Erin Busbea was the bearer of bad news for readers at her Mississippi library: Hoopla, a popular app to check out e-books and audiobooks had been suspended indefinitely in Lowndes and DeSoto counties due to the funding freeze.",
      "\u201cPeople have been calling and asking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I access my books on Hoopla?\u2019\u201d said Busbea, library director of the Columbus-Lowndes Public Library System in Columbus, a majority-Black city northeast of Jackson.",
      "The library system also had to pause parts of its interlibrary loan system allowing readers to borrow books from other states when they aren't available locally.",
      "\u201cFor most libraries that were using federal dollars, they had to curtail those activities,\" said Hulen Bivins, the Mississippi Library Commission executive director.",
      "The funding freeze came after the agency's roughly 70 staff members were placed on administrative leave in March.",
      "Attorneys general in 21 states and the American Library Association have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration for seeking to dismantle the agency.",
      "The institute's annual budget is below $300 million and distributes less than half of that to state libraries across the country. In California, the state library was notified that about 20%, or $3 million, of its $15 million grant had been terminated.",
      "\u201cThe small library systems are not able to pay for the e-books themselves,\u201d said Wendt, the California state librarian.",

      "The institute, founded in 1996 by a Republican-controlled Congress, also supports a national library training program named after former first lady Laura Bush that seeks to recruit and train librarians from diverse or underrepresented backgrounds.

    "summary": "New trade agreements will boost economic growth, says chancellor, as she sets sights on Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "The UK wants to strike a trade deal with countries in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, as its next move, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC.",
      "She claimed the UK was now in a better place on trade \"than any other country in the world\", following major trade deals with India, the US and the EU that were signed this month.",
      "Reeves also suggested that the prospect of closer trading relationships would boost forecasts for UK growth.",
      "But opposition parties have criticised the government for some of the concessions offered in return for trade deals.",
      "In early April, the government said it was continuing discussions with Gulf nations, started by the previous Conservative government, which focused on boosting UK food and drink, renewable energy and manufacturing exports, and attracting more inward investment into the UK.",
      "If that is the government's next deal it may prove politically controversial, given the human rights record of some of the six countries involved.",
      "However, Reeves said the UK was \"not looking to have trade negotiations with China\", which could raise similar objections.",
      "Reeves was speaking to the BBC in the wake of the announcement of a trade pact with the EU on Monday, which has prompted criticism from opposition parties.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the latest EU deal took the UK \"backwards\", while Reform leader Nigel Farage said on social media that Labour had \"sold out\" the fishing industry and called the EU an \"ever-diminishing political union\".",
      "Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the EU deal was a \"welcome stepping stone\", but called for the government to go further and agree to a customs union.",
      "The deal with the EU, including fishing, trade, defence and energy, marks the biggest agreement between the parties since the UK left the trading bloc in 2020 following the Brexit vote.",
      "That pact follows hot on the heels of a trade deal with India which makes it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to the country, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports.",
      "The government has also secured an agreement with US President Donald Trump to reduce tariffs on some goods traded between the nations.",
      "Growth boost",
      "Reeves suggested to the BBC that Britain's economic growth forecast was on course to be upgraded as a result of the three trade agreements.",
      "When the government's official forecasting body provides its assessment of the economy alongside the autumn Budget, it would take into account stronger than expected growth in the first three months of the year, and improved trading relations, she said.",
      "\"We are forecasting growth of 1% this year, and we had 0.7% in Q1 and they'll take into account the new trade deals that have been secured,\" said Reeves.",
      "The \"reset\" with the EU only removes some of the additional barriers to trade resulting from Brexit, and so is only expected to boost growth by less than half a per cent.",
      "Economists say more economic benefits could be gained from rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement, but those are \"red lines\" the government has said it will not cross.",
      "A higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created by businesses investing, but it would also give the chancellor more room to manoeuvre when it comes to tax or borrowing rises, or spending cuts.",
      "However, the strong uptick in growth between January and March is not expected to last, in part due to the effect of US tariffs on global growth.",
      "EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said business organisations and firms, ranging from defence to the supermarkets, had welcomed the agreement because it would be \"economically advantageous up and down the country\".",
      "He conceded that not all of the government's ambitions had been achieved, including establishing new rules allowing musicians, performers, accountants and lawyers to work more easily in the EU.",
      "Shadow foreign minister, Priti Patel, said she was \"all for reducing cost and bureaucracy\" but criticised the deal's \"lack of detail\".",
      "Pushed on why the previous Conservative government had not pursued a new deal with the EU earlier she told the BBC's Today Programme the original Brexit arrangement had always been \"transitional\".",
      "\"We all knew we would go back and look at further discussions,\" she said.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "Food standards",
      "It appears the government had the EU, the UK's largest trading partner, in mind during its talks with the US and India.",
      "As part of the deal with the EU, in return for extending current fishing rules, checks have been reduced on UK food exports.",
      "Reeves said UK officials had made it clear to the Trump administration and India that food standards were not up for negotiation in their agreements.",
      "\"We increased the quota for the import of beef from the US, it was all still on the high standards that we pride ourselves in, and in part because standards matter to us, but also because we wanted to secure this agreement with the EU, which is by far the biggest market for UK agriculture and fishing,\" the chancellor said.",
      "Both sides agreed to cooperate further on a \"youth experience scheme\" allowing young people to work and travel more freely again, but this is subject to further negotiations.",
      "Reeves described the recent trade agreements as having \"come along like buses\" and said \"Britain is in a better place than any other country in the world in terms of deals with those countries\".",
      "\"The first deal and the best deal so far with the US, we've got the best deal with the EU for any country outside the EU, and we've got the best trade agreement with India,\" Reeves added.",
      "\"Not only are these important in their own right, but it also shows that Britain now is the place for investment and business, because we've got preferential deals with the biggest economies around the world.\""

      "The Irish airline has written to Spanish trade union the USO to say it will be informing its members how much they owe after it won a court case which nullified a pay deal agreed with a different group.",
      "The salary increase was agreed with the separate CCOO union but it applied to all flight attendants.",
      "Ryanair said: \"USO are complaining about pay cuts that result from their court case. Ryanair is complying with the court case that USO took to cut pay while it is under appeal.\"",
      "The union told the BBC: \"We are working on finding the most adequate legal solution for the matter.\"",
      "According to the USO, the rises that Ryanair is attempting to claw back from union members range between \u20ac1,500 and \u20ac3,000 and were paid between October last year and March, when a Spanish court gave its ruling on the original salary deal.",
      "A spokesperson for Ryanair declined to answer questions on how many flight attendants it is pursuing or what will happen if they do not pay back the money.",
      "But the USO said the airline has told the affected flight attendants \"that the money will be simply deducted from the payslip until the debt is paid\".",
      "It added that \"some of the non-aligned workers are not forced to pay the amount back\" but \"all USO delegates have been requested to return the money\".",
      "In a letter, Ryanair describes the union's decision to maintain the terms agreed under the original deal with the CCOO, which the USO fought to nullify, as \"farcical\".",
      "However, the union maintains that those negotiating the deal were not authorised to do so and \"legally couldn't sign that kind of agreement which is why USO left the negotiations, after advising all other parties that the negotiations were irregular\".",
      "The union added that members and non-members have had their salary reverted to what it was before the agreement was implemented."

    "story": [
      "Sneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up.",
      "Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling.",
      "Rising temperatures are even worse for outdoor workers. \"This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,\" Ms Sachar says.",
      "She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.",
      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on. Although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in prices, that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",

      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",
      "And that strategic focus on building on our economic strength is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time of geopolitical uncertainty"

    "story": [
      "Investors might have hoped the turmoil that hit financial markets last month was over. But another bout of volatility in US borrowing costs is a sign that worries continue to bubble.",
      "The interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed the 5% on Monday, before retreating slightly. That was the highest level since October 2023.",
      "It came after Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating on Friday, citing the rising debt over the past decade.",
      "Congress is meanwhile advancing a tax-and-spending bill that would add trillions to the US government's $36tn in debt.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - sometimes called Treasuries - to investors on financial markets.",
      "Investors buy the bond, providing the government with cash, and are typically repaid, plus interest over a number of pre-agreed years.",
      "Just as with a regular loan, bonds perceived to be risky have higher interest rates, also called yields.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks such as the Bank of England.",
      "Some hold on to the bonds until the term of the loan expires, while others sell them to other investors.",
      "What's happening with US bonds?",
      "Historically, the US government has been shielded from having to pay high interest rates, because Treasuries have been considered safe.",
      "That is because the US economy has been strong, with stable prices, and the US government was considered a reliable partner, unlikely to default.",
      "The yields on 30-year Treasuries hovered around 3% for much of decade following the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "When it crossed 5% in October 2023, it was the first time it had hit that threshold in 16 years.",
      "The yield on 30-year Treasuries climbed to 5.04% on Monday, up from 4.9% on Friday before the downgrade, before falling back under the 5% mark.",
      "So what are the new risks?",
      "Yields started rising in 2021, as the US was hit by soaring prices after the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Concerns reignited last month, after President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs globally, which analysts said would hurt the economy and drive up prices.",
      "At the same time, the US has been running up its debt, with little sign of slowdown in sight.",
      "On Friday, Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating, citing the growing debt and little progress toward resolving it.",
      "The move was not unexpected. Moody's was the last of the three rating agencies to take the step and had warned in 2023 that this might happen.",
      "But the situation it described was underscored when part of Congress voted on Sunday to advance a tax bill that would add at least $3tn to US debt over the next decade.",
      "The \"Moody's downgrade is, effectively, a political assessment, as much as it is an economic one\", wrote Macquarie Bank analyst Thierry Wizman.",
      "\"The political and institutional breakdown - in regard to the US's lack of capacity to 'course correct', is the true meaning of the downgrade, rather than the high debt load itself.\"",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "According to Moody's, interest payments in the US are on a path to consume 30% of the federal government's revenue by 2035, compared with 9% in 2021.",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "Just as importantly, interest rates for the government typically influence interest rates charged on other kinds of loans, such as mortgages or credit cards.",
      "So higher interest rates for the government mean higher interest rates for households and businesses, too.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years.",
      "If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs."

      "The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,720, down from the current level of \u00a31,849.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "\"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,\" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.",
      "He added that, while it was \"a step in the right direction\", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills \"remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade\".",
      "\"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,\" he said.",
      "Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills.",
      "However she added that \"households will still be paying \u00a3100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets\".",
      "\"This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale.\"",
      "Andy Manning, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the drop \"might ease the burden of high bills for some households\", but added that \"it'll be cold comfort for those pushed to the brink by the legacy of the energy crisis\".",
      "\"Energy use and bills typically go down during the summer months, but the government can't get complacent,\" he said, calling for more support for those struggling with energy bills.",
      "Citizen Advice research from February 2025 shows that 6.7 million people in Great Britain are living in a household in debt to their energy supplier, with over 8.3 million households finding it difficult to afford their energy bills.",
      "Energy price cap: What next for gas and electricity bills and can I fix?",
      "Last month, Cornwall Insight had predicted a larger fall in the cap - to \u00a31,683 - and it said the new forecast partly reflected higher wholesale energy prices.",
      "It predicted the energy price cap would fall again in October, followed by another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, it warned these forecasts could be affected by a number of factors, including changing weather patterns, US tariffs, and the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine."

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 21:55:21 GMT",
    "summary": "An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.",
    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:59:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A new deal extending access for EU boats in UK waters has been agreed as part of a wider softening of relations with the bloc.",
    "story": [
      "Some sections of Scotland's fishing industry have accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of \"capitulating\" to the EU over a deal on access to UK waters.",
      "Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports.",
      "The agreement was described as \"disastrous\" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a \"great betrayal of our fishing fleet\".",
      "But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a \"slashing of red tape\" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.",
      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a \"win-win\" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry.",
      "The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of \"capitulation\" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will \"slash red tape\", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs.",
      "The UK government is trying to offset the disappointment of some in the fishing industry with a \u00a3360m fund for coastal communities.",
      "There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome.",
      "However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU.",
      "They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy.",
      "An earlier \"reset\" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together.",
      "But Scottish ministers argue that they should have been consulted on today's deal, despite foreign affairs being a matter reserved to Westminster.",

    "story": [
      "The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the \"wild west\" of unregulated borrowing.",
      "Under the legislation, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds.",
      "The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford.",
      "Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay.",
      "Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months.",
      "For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt.",
      "BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a \"crucial step\" towards better protection for shoppers.",
      "\"For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,\" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice.",
      "\"For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers.\"",
      "Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous government unveiled plans in 2023.",
      "Under the new legislation, which is due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed.",
      "It says this means \"upfront\" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.",
      "Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had \"transformed shopping for millions\", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a \"wild west\".",
      "\"These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,\" she added.",
      "Last week, a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had \"risen significantly\", climbing by two million in the past three years.",
      "It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products.",
      "Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated \"many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments\".",

    "summary": "The previous government had said autonomous vehicles were \"set to be on the road\" by 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Uber has said it is \"ready to go\" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles.",
      "The previous administration said fully autonomous cars were \"set to be on roads by 2026\", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027.",
      "While limited self-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used.",
      "With some companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve.",
      "\"We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,\" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride.",
      "The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve.",
      "It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US.",
      "They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore.",
      "But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed.",
      "\"We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027\", the Department for Transport said in a statement.",
      "\"We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,\" it added.",
      "'Hands-off' experience",
      "In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week.",
      "Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel.",
      "The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out.",
      "That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle.",
      "A poll by YouGov in 2024 suggested that 37% of Brits would feel \"very unsafe\" travelling in a car without a driver.",
      "But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon \"becomes the new normal\".",
      "That was certainly my experience during our ride.",
      "I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software.",
      "It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses.",
      "The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes.",
      "George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed.",
      "If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am \u2013 and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty.",
      "Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated.",
      "But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data.",
      "But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in.",
      "In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how his robotaxi drove round in circles in an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help.",
      "General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns.",
      "\"The reality is that one accident is too many,\" said Uber's Mr Macdonald.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 23:39:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

    "summary": "UK's largest gas storage facility will miss \u00a32bn investment without help, boss of Centrica tells BBC.",
    "story": [
      "The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.",
      "Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be \"shut down\" without government help over energy pricing.",
      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",
      "Pay row",
      "Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the \u00a34.5m pay he received the previous year was \"impossible to justify\".",
      "And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans.",
      "When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: \"I don't set my own pay.",
      "\"I think it's really difficult,\" he said. \"I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done.\""

      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

      "Thomas-Symonds, who is leading the negotiations, said he was driven by \"ruthless pragmatism\" and focused on jobs, lower household bills and stronger borders.",
      "The minister also said the government would assess whether to contribute money to EU projects on a case-by-case basis, saying it would \"consider each one on its merits\".",
      "Asked whether he was confident British travellers would be able to use EU e-gates at European airports, Thomas-Symonds said: \"I'm certainly pushing for people to be able to go through far more quickly.",

      "The minister did not respond directly to questioning on whether there would be a cap on numbers or time-limited visas, such as in existing schemes with Australia and Canada, but did stress \"that control element is hugely important\".",

      "A joint declaration that addresses the worrying geopolitical situation and emphasises UK-EU shared foreign policy priorities - such as supporting Ukraine, keeping up pressure on Russia, and ending civilian suffering in Gaza",
      "An EU-UK security and defence pact",
      "A package of measures targeted at removing some trade barriers between the EU and UK that have come about because of Brexit",
      "Closer economic ties to Europe",
      "These trade measures are the \"reset\" of relations with the EU that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised since his party won a general election last summer.",
      "They are far from an economic gamechanger for the UK, though. Hardly what you'd call ambitious.",
      "Destroying all trade barriers with the EU is impossible if the Labour government keeps to its own \"red lines\" of not rejoining the bloc's customs union or single market.",
      "Despite promising to prioritise UK economic growth, and polls suggesting the majority of Britons want to do more trade with the EU, Labour will feel hemmed in by the increasingly popular, Eurosceptic Reform Party.",
      "It performed well in recent local elections in the UK.",
      "While some in Labour (quietly) admit they are tempted by a customs union with the EU to boost growth, any economic benefits would likely not be apparent to voters before the next UK election.",
      "Party members fear they would risk being punished at the polls, amidst accusations by the opposition Conservatives and Reform that the government would have betrayed Brexit.",
      "These concerns make the Starmer government \"more cautious, less bold\", says Mr Menon.",
      "So what will be agreed at the summit?",
      "The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach to try to reduce costly trade barriers with the EU.",
      "Many EU-UK negotiating hours have gone into agreeing a plant and animal health deal, known as an SPS agreement.",
      "This will facilitate the export and import of meat and plant products between the EU and UK and help reduce post-Brexit trade complications between Northern Ireland and Britain.",
      "In exchange, the EU insists the UK must agree to following any new SPS rules introduced in the future and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in policing the agreement.",
      "Those conditions will likely be unpopular with ardent Brexit supporters.",
      "They might also put backs up in Washington and complicate the UK doing a wider future deal on agriculture with the US, as the UK would be tied to stringent EU standards.",
      "But the Labour government knows public opinion polls suggest most people in the UK prioritise trade with the EU over the US.",
      "Currently the EU counts for 41% of UK exports; the US for 21%.",
      "The UK government will probably insist the SPS agreement is good for the British economy. Though animal and plant exports and imports are, in fact, a small part of overall GDP.",
      "In reality \"growth is a bit of a red herring here\", says Mr Menon.",
      "On the EU side, the French, backed by other fishing nations like the Netherlands and Denmark, have taken a tough stance in these talks - refusing to sign up unless the UK agrees to long-term EU fishing rights in UK waters.",
      "The current post-Brexit fishing agreement expires next year.",
      "Free-er movement for some",
      "The reset we'll hear about at Monday's summit will also include a \"mobility\" section.",

      "There will also be a reduction in visa restrictions for UK musicians travelling and performing in the EU.",
      "In exchange, the EU - and Germany, most passionately - wants a youth mobility scheme, allowing young EU citizens to travel, study, and even work in the UK.",

      "There will also be talk at the summit of plans to tackle illegal migration, cooperate on carbon border taxes, and simplify energy trading between the EU and UK.",
      "Reducing EU-UK trade barriers on chemicals and pharmaceutical goods is also a UK ambition, as is getting access to EU databases, like the Schengen Information System, to better track down criminals.",
      "But for now, at least, the EU is saying no to that. If it makes an exception for the UK, other non-EU countries will demand the same, it insists.",
      "Of course, it's in the interest of both sides to fight cross-border crime. The UK argues the current state of the world calls for more flexible thinking from Brussels.",
      "Defence and security complications",
      "The case for more flexible thinking is also something the UK is calling for when it comes to Monday's defence and security pact with the EU.",
      "The EU and UK already work closely together on Russian sanctions and defending Ukraine. And the pact isn't a legally binding document, so how complicated can these talks be, you may ask?",
      "The answer is pretty complicated.",
      "The UK wants its defence companies to be allowed to bid for contracts under the EU's new re-armament scheme, SAFE (Security Action for Europe).",
      "\"The UK has earned the right to access such a deal because of the leadership it's shown over Ukraine,\" says international defence expert Sophia Gaston, a visiting fellow at King's College London.",
      "\"Britain is a serious player both in traditional defence capabilities, like producing munitions, and in cutting edge defence innovation, where new growth and energy is.",
      "\"If the UK has access to the emerging EU defence programmes, it can contribute to mass and pace. [The war in Ukraine] has shown that both are needed.\"",
      "But Ms Gaston admits, UK companies getting the go-ahead from Brussels is a \"messy\" process.",
      "\"Re-Arm EU\", as Brussels dubs its new drive, is still a work in progress, spurred by rapidly changing geopolitics, including fears the US will withdraw at least some of the crucial security support Europe has relied on since World War Two.",
      "This is not yet a fully formed EU strategy that the UK can \"pay to play\" a part in, as it has done post-Brexit with the EU's research and innovation scheme Horizon, for example.",

      "If the EU is spending its taxpayers' money on defence, it argues it should be spent with EU companies to help boost EU economies.",
      "Paris also says, in this rapidly changing world of shifting alliances and allegiances, the EU should be self-reliant, not dependent on suppliers outside the bloc.",
      "Sceptics suspect France, which has a sophisticated defence industry, of wanting to hoover up lucrative EU contracts for itself.",
      "But it looks like it is losing the internal EU argument, with the Nordics, the Baltics, Poland, Italy and the Netherlands favouring more openness on defence contracts, and particularly with the EU's biggest economic power, Germany, championing the UK.",
      "\"Germany and France have very different attitudes towards the UK,\" says German economist Armin Steinbach from think tank Bruegel.",
      "Germany will always put relations with EU heavyweights France and Poland first, says Mr Steinbach.",
      "But he believes the UK will be helped in defence and economic negotiations with the EU by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who argues \"a unified Europe is the absolute priority in the current geopolitical setting\".",
      "Huge challenge of defence cooperation",
      "A priority maybe, but it's still a hugely tall order because it's all about compromise.",
      "Political leaders will seek to justify increases in defence spending by insisting to voters that it's for their personal security and in the interest of their national economy, with boosts in revenue for domestic defence industries.",
      "But achieving a pan-European industrial base - built to be efficient, avoid duplication, and to replace much of the US capacity relied on by the continent today - would mean some European countries winning more defence contracts than others.",
      "It would also mean some national businesses shutting down, in favour of better-suited ones elsewhere on the continent.",
      "That's a hard sell for political leaders facing their voters.",
      "As is another big trade-off: Big increases in defence spending will mean governments have less money to spend on public services.",

      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

    "summary": "The Caribbean island is building a power station that will use steam naturally heated by volcanic rock.",
    "story": [
      "With rainforests, waterfalls, volcanoes and hot springs, the Caribbean island of Dominica's dramatic landscape is a haven for adventure-seeking ecotourists.",
      "It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels.",
      "Nicknamed the \"Nature Island\", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector.",
      "To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock.",
      "The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year.",
      "Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart.",
      "Dominica country profile",
      "\"We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,\" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills.",
      "And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands.",
      "Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources.",
      "Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades.",
      "The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies.",
      "It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).",
      "The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures.",
      "\"Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,\" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. \"Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant.\"",
      "Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa.",
      "\"Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,\" Mr Blachar explains. \"It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise.\"",
      "Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley.",
      "\"There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,\" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process \"decimated wildlife\" including endemic frogs.",
      "Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (\u00a311.3m).",
      "Dr Henderson admits that the project is \"not easy\" for a country that \"faced a big challenge\" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists \"it will be worth it in the end\".",
      "Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes.",
      "Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations.",
      "Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become \"a hub\" for geothermal technology.",
      "Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts.",
      "With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.",
      "Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year.",
      "It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme.",
      "Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands.",
      "Mr John says that the facility will \"serve as a test case for an attractive alternative\" to fossil fuels. \"The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here \u2013 both what worked and what didn't,\" he adds.",
      "The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then.",
      "OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a \"bold and visionary step\".",
      "\"As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy.\""

      "The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,720, down from the current level of \u00a31,849.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.",
      "The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.",
      "\"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,\" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight.",
      "He added that, while it was \"a step in the right direction\", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills \"remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade\".",
      "\"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,\" he said.",
      "Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills.",
      "However she added that \"households will still be paying \u00a3100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets\".",
      "\"This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale.\"",

      "The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the \"wild west\" of unregulated borrowing.",
      "Under the legislation, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds.",
      "The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford.",
      "Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay.",
      "Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months.",
      "For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt.",
      "BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a \"crucial step\" towards better protection for shoppers.",
      "\"For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,\" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice.",
      "\"For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers.\"",
      "Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous government unveiled plans in 2023.",
      "Under the new legislation, which is due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed.",
      "It says this means \"upfront\" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.",
      "Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had \"transformed shopping for millions\", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a \"wild west\".",
      "\"These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,\" she added.",
      "Last week, a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had \"risen significantly\", climbing by two million in the past three years.",
      "It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products.",
      "Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated \"many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments\".",
      "A spokesman for Klarna, one of the biggest suppliers of BNPL services in the UK, said the company had supported regulation for the sector since 2020.",
      "\"It's good to see progress on regulation, and we look forward to working with the FCA on rules to protect consumers and encourage innovation,\" he said.",
      "Another major BNPL provider, Clearpay, said it would \"support the FCA to deliver fit-for-purpose regulation that ensures consumer protection, provides much-needed innovation in consumer credit, and supports the UK's thriving FinTech sector\".",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 21:55:21 GMT",
    "summary": "An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.",
    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "At the end of the hearings, the judge granted the mother's application, removing the father's parental rights and barring him from all contact, including on social media, until the child turns 18.",

      "Bethan and her parents were delighted.",
      "But the government called the July election - and the law didn't change.",
      "In the most recent King's Speech, in 2024, the Labour government promised to enact the change, saying it would restrict parental responsibility for child sex offenders.",
      "However, when the wording of the new law was published on 7 May it said that removing parental responsibility would only apply \"for a serious sexual offence committed against a child for whom the offender has parental responsibility\".",
      "In other words, where someone had abused their own child or stepchild.",
      "This would not cover Bethan's family.",
      "Bethan's parents said the government should go back to the bill that Harriet Harman had proposed, where the emphasis was on \"protecting innocent children\" rather than \"thinking about the rights of the paedophile\".",
      "The draft legislation - which will have its second reading in Parliament today - also says the restriction of parental responsibility should apply only where someone has been sentenced to at least four years in prison.",
      "The grandparents of Bethan's child believe it should apply more widely.",
      "\"Really what we're talking about here is where the line is drawn. And we obviously think that line should be drawn much lower down,\" the child's grandfather said.",
      "The grandmother said the court case had been a \"terrible stress\" for her daughter.",
      "\"What people don't realise is when you take on a family court case, it's like taking on a full time job because it takes hundreds of hours to get the information together,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",

    "story": [
      "Average private school fees were 22% higher in January 2025 than in January 2024, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most independent schools in the UK.",
      "The government introduced VAT on school fees in January to pay for more state school teachers in England.",
      "But the ISC and a number of families have taken the government to the High Court over claims the policy is discriminatory and breaches human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods and services. The standard rate of VAT is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education. That exemption was removed on 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are charities, which means that they also received an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "The government removed that tax relief in April, but dropped earlier plans to scrap private schools' charitable status entirely.",
      "How will the government spend the extra VAT raised?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in the 2024/25 financial year, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools - including funding the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for many years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "The government also said there will be funding to address other issues in schools, such as crumbling buildings and delays in the system for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",

      "It blamed the \"triple whammy\" of higher national insurance contributions, an end to charitable business rates relief and the introduction of VAT.",
      "The government had previously said it expected fees to rise by an average of around 10%.",
      "In response to the ISC figures, a Treasury spokesperson said the increase was \"not only down to VAT\", and that private school fees had risen significantly in recent decades.",
      "According to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, average fees rose by 55% (after inflation) between 2003 and 2023.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period did not fall.",
      "Will the VAT changes mean the number of private pupils will fall?",
      "When it announced the VAT increase, the government said it did not expect there to be a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "According to a Treasury memo seen by the BBC, initial estimates suggested that 54,000 pupils would be displaced, with most moving to state schools within the first two years.",
      "However, the government now predicts that around 35,000 students will move to the state sector over a longer time period, and that class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which said that state system could \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The ISC says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in the number of Year 7 pupils starting school in September 2024.",
      "It believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by the ISC, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argue that the policy goes against the legal right to an education, and claim it is discriminatory because it affects families attending low-paying faith schools.",
      "The group also cites the effect on children with Send. Those who attend private school because their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\" but who do not have an EHCP have to pay VAT.",
      "The court was told that the government had considered introducing the policy in September 2025, rather than in January.",
      "But it rejected this idea because the main objective of the VAT change was to raise additional tax revenue to support the 94% of children who attend state schools, and any delay would have undermined that.",
      "Government lawyers argued that families who wished to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider amending the policy, but would be under no obligation to do so."

    "story": [
      "The House of Lords has dealt a second defeat to the government over its Data (Use and Access) Bill.",
      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",
      "\"They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output.",
      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",
      "Sir Elton John angry at 'criminal' AI plans for artists",
      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",
      "\"I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else.\"",
      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "It is not known exactly when the thieves broke the toilet into smaller pieces, or whether they melted the gold themselves.",

      "In a touching climax, the 21-year-old danced with an image of his childhood self in a mirror on the stage.",
      "Also reflecting on their childhood was French singer Louane, whose tearjerking ballad was dedicated to her mother, who died of cancer when she was 17.",

      "This is a sorry end to a long BBC career. Gary Lineker was among the corporation's highest-paid presenters for a reason - he is popular with audiences, knowledgeable and brilliant at his job.",
      "But it's an understatement to suggest he has also caused problems for his BBC bosses over the years, as their high-profile football host began to morph into a presenter with opinions that he voiced on social media.",
      "In the end, those two things were increasingly in conflict.",
      "This has always been about reputation management for the BBC. Lineker had already, in the eyes of BBC bosses, caused the corporation damage with previous social media posts. Mistakenly sharing a video about Zionism which included a rat emoji was the final straw.",
      "It was difficult to see how he could continue presenting for the corporation, particularly at a time when the BBC is enmeshed in another controversy surrounding a documentary about Gaza, which it pulled after discovering the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "I think what's different is that on this occasion, Lineker regrets his actions. He has appeared bullish about previous posts, saying that while he regretted damaging the BBC, he didn't believe, for example, that comparing the language of a Conservative asylum policy to that of 1930s Germany was wrong.",
      "Lineker is genuinely upset by what happened. He is mortified that he reposted the video. His relationship with the BBC is coming to an end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted.",
      "He seemed unable or unwilling to accept that his high profile might prevent him from voicing strongly-held views that many believed had an impact on the BBC's need for impartiality.",
      "We live increasingly in an age when people want to express their opinions, and often do. Social media has given everyone a platform, and high-profile media figures have huge followings.",
      "He could not keep quiet. In the end, it brought him down.",
      "But he is a successful podcast entrepreneur, owning a third of the shares in Goalhanger, the company behind hit shows including The Rest is History and The Rest is Politics.",
      "I would also not be surprised if he does appear in the future on TV, perhaps even as a presenter of the World Cup for another outlet.",

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker, who will leave the BBC after hosting his final Match of the Day on Sunday, was the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As the face of the corporation's flagship football show for 26 years, he was also one of the its highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million in 2023.",
      "But last November's agreement between Lineker and the BBC that he'd stop hosting Match of the Day, and continue to front the FA Cup and World Cup into  2026, is in tatters.",
      "It follows last week's controversy when he shared a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.",
      "He immediately deleted it after criticism, saying he was unaware of the image's symbolism, and later said he \"apologised unreservedly\".",
      "But the ensuing headlines will not be the ones Lineker will have wanted or anticipated for his final weeks at the BBC - he'd worked hard for years to build up his reputation as a stellar broadcaster.",
      "Live updates: Gary Lineker to leave the BBC after social media 'error'",
      "Live updates: Gary Lineker to leave the BBC after social media 'error'",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft after his successful football career.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told BBC Radio 4's Media Show in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\".",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker fronting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June last year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March 2023, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "Mr Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February last year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "In February 2025, Lineker made headlines when he was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.",
      "The documentary was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the film while it carried out further due diligence. The corporation has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of the film and the matter is still subject to an internal investigation.",
      "Last month, Lineker spoke to BBC presenter Amol Rajan, and was asked about the comments he posted on social media in March 2023.",
      "Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "However it appears that the latest round of headlines about the sports presenter made his position untenable.",
      "Despite his BBC career being cut even shorter, Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at last year's Podcast Awards.",
      "At the recent Arias radio awards, Goalhanger was named audio brand of the year.",
      "The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, is also on BBC Sounds.",
      "Lineker will be replaced on Match of the Day by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season.",
      "He indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now\" and \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world\".",
      "It will be interesting to see if he takes up any potential offers from rival broadcast outlets, or if he really has stepped back from TV for good.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:35:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The brothers' fate will now be in the hands of California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.",
      "Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards.",
      "But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.",
      "At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (\u00a3526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.",
      "This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.",
      "Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.",
      "They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.",
      "Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.",
      "They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.",
      "Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.",
      "During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate.",
      "Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court \u2013 including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the \"abuse excuse\" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like \"the bad sons\" and \"American sons, American murderers\".",
      "Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like \"misjudged\" and \"boys betrayed\".",
      "TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.",
      "\"Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,\" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece.",
      "In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.",
      "But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.",
      "\"Not only does it create a permission structure,\" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, \"in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma\".",
      "Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.",
      "\"The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,\" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse.",
      "In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.",
      "The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a \"hurricane\" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.",
      "\"The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,\" she said.",
      "Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.",
      "\"The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,\" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.",
      "\"I'm not as hopeless as I was as a 21-year-old, that's for sure. Obviously, I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.\"",
      "Where do the Menendez brothers go from here?",
      "The fate of the brothers \u2013 regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends \u2013 ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.",
      "And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028.",
      "Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.",
      "Weighing in on such a divisive case could be \"risky\", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.",
      "\"Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,\" he said. \"That would be the worst thing for him.\"",
      "Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.",
      "\"The question for the board is a rather simple one,\" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  \"Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.\"",
      "Mr Rand acknowledged the case is \"risky\" politically for Newsom.",
      "\"You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,\" Rand told the BBC. \"But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.\"",
      "The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison.",
      "They've also led productive lives while incarcerated, with Erik founding a hospice programme to help elderly and disabled inmates while Lyle has been working on prison beautification.",
      "Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family \u2013 from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.",
      "\"They chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service,\" their cousin Anamaria Baralt said outside the court after they were resentenced.",

    "story": [
      "In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade.",
      "But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise.",
      "On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand. All eyes were fixed on the eight-months pregnant singer, as she strolled past her ex-boyfriend, whom she had not seen in six years.",
      "Ms Ventura was there to testify in the federal sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution case against Mr Combs, whom she accuses of abusing her and coercing her into unwanted sex acts - so-called \"freak-offs\" - during their 11-and-a-half year relationship.",

      "The parties that led to Diddy's downfall",
      "Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution - all of which he has vehemently denied.",
      "Surrounded by his children and dozens of family and friends, Mr Combs has watched Ms Ventura from his chair at the defence table just a few dozen feet away.",
      "All the while, US District Judge Arun Subramanian has pushed attorneys to stay on schedule, as prosecutors have expressed worry their star witness could go into labour with her third child as soon as this weekend.",
      "An aspiring musician falls in love with a 'larger-than-life' rapper",
      "On her first day on the stand, Ms Ventura began by taking prosecutors through the start of her tumultuous relationship with Mr Combs, whom she met when she was a 19-year-old aspiring musician. Mr Combs, 17 years her senior, signed her onto his record label.",
      "Their romantic relationship began soon after, when Ms Ventura fell in love with the \"larger-than-life\" musician and entrepreneur, she said. But it was not long before she noticed a \"different\" side to him, Ms Ventura testified, at times wiping the tears from her eyes.",
      "Mr Combs, she said, wanted to control every aspect of her life. He paid for her rent, her car, and her phone, sometimes taking the items away to \"punish\" her when he was upset, she said.",
      "Eventually, the relationship turned violent. She testified about the time when he attacked her because she was sleeping, slashing her eyebrow as he threw her onto the corner of her bed as her two friends tried to stop him. The court was shown a photo of the gash that Ms Ventura said Mr Combs hired a plastic surgeon to fix secretly. There was another time at a party where he kicked her head as she cowered behind a toilet in a bathroom stall, she said.",
      "While jurors remained concentrated on her testimony and the evidence, betraying little emotion, some in the courtroom wiped away tears or looked away from the graphic photos and videos - including the viral video of Mr Combs beating and dragging Ms Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Published by CNN last year, the video has been viewed by millions - including many of the jurors before they were seated in the trial - and Ms Ventura, who was forced to rewatch the incident of abuse several times this week.",
      "Freak-offs become 'a job'",
      "Ms Ventura testified that the hotel incident took place after she tried to leave a \"freak-off\", a sexual encounter in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched and recorded from the corner.",
      "Ms Ventura said the rapper introduced her to freak-offs around a year into their relationship, and at first, she did it to make him happy.",
      "But over time, the encounters humiliated her, she said. They would sometimes last as long as four days, and require Ms Ventura to take countless drugs to stay awake, she said. She endured injuries like painful urinary tract infections - and once even blacked out, waking up in the shower, she said.",
      "\"It made me feel worthless,\" she told the court. \"Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.\"",
      "The couple would go on to have \"hundreds\" of freak-offs, Ms Ventura estimated.",
      "After years of temporary break-ups - some fuelled by Mr Combs' affairs - Ms Ventura ended her relationship with Mr Combs for good in 2018, the same year she alleges the rapper raped her in her home as she cried.",
      "Ms Ventura went on to date and marry her personal trainer, Alex Fine, with whom she has two children, but the trauma of her relationship has stayed with her.",
      "Through tears, Ms Ventura told the court of a time two years ago when she considered taking her own life, when traumatic flashbacks of her time with Mr Combs became too much to handle. Her husband helped her seek therapy to recover, she said.",
      "Consent vs compliance: Prosecutors build their sex trafficking case",
      "Get all the latest trial updates on the BBC Sounds 'Diddy on Trial' podcast available wherever you get your BBC podcasts.",
      "Throughout Ms Ventura's harrowing story of domestic violence, prosecutors have tried to thread in elements of their larger sex trafficking and racketeering case against Mr Combs.",
      "Mr Combs's attorneys have already conceded that the rapper was abusive - and have argued they would not have fought a domestic violence case against him. But, \"domestic violence is not sex trafficking\", Mr Combs' attorney Teny Geragos argued this week.",
      "The federal government has charged Mr Combs with transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "He is also charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The statute was created to take on mob bosses, but has since been used in other cases, including sex trafficking, such as the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly.",
      "Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson used parts of Ms Ventura's story to boost this case, asking her about the guns the rapper had access to and the ways he allegedly blackmailed her.",
      "Ms Ventura told the court of a time when she said Mr Combs pulled up videos he recorded of their freak-offs on his laptop, in view of others on a commercial flight. She said he told her he would release them if she didn't behave.",
      "\"I felt trapped,\" Ms Ventura said.",
      "Arick Fudali, a lawyer who represents an unnamed victim in the government's case against Mr Combs, said \"the fear of what would happen if they didn't comply\" is a crucial element of the government's case.",
      "\"Someone can consent to a sexual act of course,\" Mr Fudali told the BBC. \"But someone can also be coerced into being compliant, and that's different.\"",
      "The government has also used Ms Ventura's testimony to try to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.",
      "Prosecutors have asked Ms Ventura about security guards who she said stood by while Mr Combs abused her. Ms Ventura has testified about Mr Combs' employees' involvement in setting up freak-offs with supplies like baby oil, and booking travel for the male escorts they hired.",
      "Mr Combs' team says jealousy and drugs fuelled violence",
      "After a day and a half on the stand, it was Mr Combs' attorneys turn to question Ms Ventura.",
      "The rapper's lawyer, Anna Estevao, relied on hundreds of pages of text messages between Mr Combs and Ms Ventura to help push her team's broader arguments: that Ms Ventura was a willing participant in freak-offs in a toxic relationship fuelled by drugs and jealousy.",
      "Mr Combs' legal team showed messages from Ms Ventura to Mr Combs in which she said she was \"always ready\" for a freak-off, and another time when she said she wished they could have had one.",
      "Ms Ventura acknowledged writing the messages while adding that those were \"just words at that point\".",
      "Ms Estevao also kept bringing Ms Ventura back to the couple's moments of infidelity, like when Mr Combs would spend holidays with his family and former girlfriend Kim Porter, or when Ms Ventura began dating rapper Kid Cudi while she and Mr Combs were on a break.",
      "She repeatedly asked Ms Ventura about her drug use and how both she and Mr Combs struggled with opioid addiction at times.",
      "In these moments, the defence was trying to show jurors that it was a toxic, violent and complicated relationship - but not a case of racketeering or sex trafficking, former federal prosecutor Sarah Krissoff told the BBC.",
      "The defence also made efforts to try to chip away at the government's racketeering case, asking Ms Ventura whether Mr Combs' employees had actually witnessed the freak-offs, to which Ms Ventura said she did not think so.",
      "Ultimately, Mr Fudali said, the prosecution's case will hinge on this question of compliance versus consent - whether Mr Combs' girlfriends were willing participants in his sexual fantasies or acted out of fear.",
      "\"Did Ms Ventura consent or was she coerced into complying?\" Mr Fudali said. \"That seems to be the question for the jury.\"",

    "summary": "Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.",
    "story": [
      "Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom.",
      "First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry.",
      "But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025.",
      "Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges.",
      "'You know exactly what you're getting'",
      "While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face.",
      "\"There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,\" says executive producer Marty Stratton.",
      "Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts.",
      "There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as \"forever games\".",
      "In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P.",
      "Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher.",
      "Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can \"fit into those habits\".",
      "\"It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,\" he says.",
      "The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase.",
      "But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players.",
      "Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is.",
      "\"The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,\" he says.",
      "One way of doing this is by attracting new players.",
      "Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new \"Medieval sci-fi\" setting and altered gameplay style.",
      "\"We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,\" he says.",
      "The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages.",
      "\"In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,\" says Hugo.",
      "But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry.",
      "The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years.",
      "In 2010, a new game cost roughly \u00a340 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time.",
      "If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about \u00a360 in today's money.",
      "Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs \u00a369.99 for a standard edition or almost \u00a3100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included.",
      "\"When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,\" says Marty.",
      "The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers.",
      "That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players.",
      "But Doom producer Marty argues that \"free\" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are \"no unknown expenses\" with a one-off purchase such as Doom.",
      "\"You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,\" he says.",
      "F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from \"microtransactions\" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds.",
      "Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about \u00a322 a month on those transactions.",
      "That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a \"curated experience\" with \"replay value\".",
      "\"Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,\" he says.",
      "Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more \"fiddling with prices\" and surcharges \"to see what customers are willing to pay\" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases.",
      "\"Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,\" he says.",
      "Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at \u00a314.99 a month.",
      "There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price.",
      "Game Pass players could pay a \u00a334.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content.",

    "story": [
      "Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.",
      "The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.",
      "The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was \"completely in my wheelhouse\", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.",
      "Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look.",
      "\"I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,\" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.",
      "Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.",
      "The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature \"tribal\" pattern.",
      "\"It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,\" he says.",
      "The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. \"Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?\" he asks.",
      "Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: \"When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European.",
      "\"My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.\"",
      "As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.",
      "\"We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,\" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got \"really excited\" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.",
      "The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots.",
      "The musician told Vogue: \"As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for \"child\"] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.\"",
      "The Met Gala was \"not unusual\", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his \"message\" throughout his career.",
      "Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.",
      "\"When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,\" Boateng recalls.",
      "\"The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.\"",
      "Boateng was dubbed the \"peacock of Savile Row\" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.",
      "Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.",
      "Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.",
      "As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his \"elegance\" and \"cutting edge\" designs.",
      "Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and Spike Lee.",
      "He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.",
      "The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order.",
      "Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.",
      "But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.",
      "Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.",
      "While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.",
      "Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring.",
      "They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.",
      "\"I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,\" Boateng jokes.",
      "\"It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.\"",
      "And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.",
      "\"The future is expansion,\" he says, \"raising capital to really, really push the brand globally\".",
      "\"I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.\"",

      "Stage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson.",
      "She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.",
      "The sports stars",
      "Tom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding",
      "Sports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure.",
      "\"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson.",
      "\"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\".",
      "She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through.",
      "As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"",
      "The actors",
      "Nick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie",
      "Actors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive.",
      "However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson.",
      "She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.",
      "The media personalities",
      "David Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",
      "Presenters like Kate Garraway will be used to live interactions, giving them a potential advantage at the roundtable, notes Masterson.",
      "Historian David Olusoga, as a heavyweight intellect, will likely face the same preconception struggle as Fry, she says.",
      "Masterson also adds that quiet people can struggle to go the distance on the show, as they can either be perceived as threatening or unsupportive by the group.",
      "But the show's history has shown this isn't always the case. Last year's contestant Francesca was hardly visible in the first few episodes, even prompting memes about her supposed irrelevancy, before growing into the show and making it to the final.",
      "One dark horse is YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, says author Eloise Skinner, who holds a diploma in psychotherapy.",
      "His career in social media and online content might offer an edge in the game, as someone fluent in an online world that is hyper-aware of perception."

      "Listen to this article",
      "\"Whenever I was struggling, if it was going to be a really bad day, I could then start to chat to one of these bots, and it was like [having] a cheerleader, someone who's going to give you some good vibes for the day.",
      "\"I've got this encouraging external voice going \u2013 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially.\"",
      "For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online \"chatbots\" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages.",
      "At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown.",
      "She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day.",
      "\"I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it.",
      "\"The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle.\"",
      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",

      "But with the right safeguards, some feel chatbots could be a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system.",
      "John, who has an anxiety disorder, says he has been on the waitlist for a human therapist for nine months. He has been using Wysa two or three times a week.",
      "\"There is not a lot of help out there at the moment, so you clutch at straws.\"",

    "summary": "Eight months into England's first public inquiry into mental health deaths, what have we learnt?",
    "story": [
      "Eight months into its 25-month timeline, the Lampard Inquiry is beginning to expose deep-rooted issues in NHS mental health services in Essex.",
      "With more than 2,000 deaths in inpatient units between 2000 and the end of 2023, the inquiry is examining not only local failings but also whether these reflect wider national problems. Here is what has emerged so far.",
      "A system under scrutiny",
      "The inquiry is named after its chairwoman, Baroness Kate Lampard.",
      "She is a former barrister who oversaw the NHS investigations into abuse by former television presenter Jimmy Savile.",
      "It is primarily focused on Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT), formed in 2017 from the merger of North and South Essex Partnership Trusts.",
      "It is also looking at the deaths of patients from Essex at inpatient units run by private providers and 215 facilities run by other NHS organisations, such as North East London NHS Foundation Trust.",
      "The former health ombudsman Sir Rob Behrens said on average, 5% of all mental health cases received by his team between 2011 and 2023 were related to Essex.",
      "He called the failures in care \"the National Health Service at its worst\".",
      "During testimony from the relatives and friends of those who died, it emerged that they were individuals from a range of backgrounds, including a chef, bus driver, heating engineer, former head teacher, and parish councillor.",
      "Lack of staff",
      "The inquiry has heard evidence of a long-term reduction in registered mental health nurses, with increased reliance on healthcare support workers across England. This shift has been linked to reduced patient engagement and increased risk.",
      "Former chief nurse Maria Nelligan told the inquiry this was because healthcare support workers were \"cheaper\" and said the shift compromised therapeutic care.",
      "Dr Paul Davidson, a consultant psychiatrist, described how staff across England were \"rushed off their feet,\" contributing to a workplace culture where professionals feared being blamed \"whatever decision they took\".",
      "Paul Scott, chief executive of EPUT, stated the trust had reduced its use of agency staff by 30%.",
      "Poor data",
      "The inquiry has also highlighted issues with data collection and transparency.",
      "Deborah Cole, from the charity Inquest, described how there was no \"complete set of statistics in relation to those who die in mental health detention\".",
      "Dr Davidson added: \"There is good information in relation to deaths by suicide, [but] this is not a helpful tool by which to assess how mental services are being provided overall.\"",
      "Baroness Lampard has warned that the inquiry may never uncover the full scale of deaths linked to failings in Essex mental health services.",
      "She stated that while a figure would be published, it was likely to be approximate, due to incomplete or inconsistent data over the 24-year period under review",
      "Regulating trusts",
      "The inquiry has examined the complexity of the regulatory system overseeing NHS trusts.",
      "Mr Scott described being \"overwhelmed\" by the number of regulatory bodies -19 in total - each issuing recommendations. This, he said, made it difficult to implement consistent change.",
      "Away from the inquiry, in October 2024, the health secretary stated that the government intended to reform the regulatory system.",
      "This was in response to a review of the way the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected trusts, called the Penny Dash Review, which said the framework was too complicated.",
      "The Lampard Inquiry will consider the CQC's role in relation to events in Essex.",
      "Analysis",
      "Three systemic issues raised by the inquiry - staff shortages, poor data, and regulatory complexity - have been longstanding concerns.",
      "The Royal College of Nursing, the CQC and a 2023 Public Accounts Committee report all flagged staffing shortages and burnout.",
      "A 2023 review found Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust had lost track of patient death data, while a 2025 Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) report called for a unified national dataset.",
      "Regulatory reform is also under way following multiple critical reviews.",
      "While Baroness Lampard is expected to reference these reports, the inquiry is also under pressure to uncover new evidence.",
      "Some families have expressed concern regarding its pace, and limited focus so far on cultural change.",
      "They have also noted that safeguarding issues, such as patients absconding from units, have received little attention - a relevant issue given a recent inquest into the death of an 18-year-old who died while on escorted leave from an EPUT unit.",
      "Transparency and whistleblowing",
      "Only 11 out of 14,000 staff came forward during the earlier non-statutory phase of the inquiry.",
      "Baroness Lampard has said she will use statutory powers to compel evidence if necessary.",
      "Mr Scott acknowledged that \"closed cultures\" existed at EPUT but said the trust was encouraging openness.",
      "During a recent inquest into the death of a 16-year-old patient, a manager testified that staff were reluctant to raise safety concerns.",
      "Brian O'Donnell, clinical lead at the St Aubyn Centre in Colchester, said there was a \"real concern about safety on the wards, and staff are too worried to say anything about it\".",
      "Families have also raised concerns about delays in evidence disclosure, including a postponed inquiry session on a Oxevision, an infrared monitoring system, due to late submission of information by EPUT.",
      "But Baroness Lampard said her decision to delay the hearing \"should not be viewed in any way as enabling EPUT to avoid answering questions about its use of Oxevision\".",
      "What is the Lampard Inquiry and what could it change?",
      "What comes next?",
      "In July, the inquiry will focus on the two former trusts that merged to form EPUT.",
      "Mr Scott has said, when he arrived at the trust in 2000, the legacy of the merger was that \"there was too much focus on governance and management and not enough on patient safety\".",
      "Families are calling for detailed scrutiny of individual deaths, but the inquiry is more likely to use selected cases to illustrate broader systemic issues such as governance, and culture.",
      "Mr Scott has apologised for deaths under the trust's care and stated that he believes EPUT should remain the provider of mental health services in Essex.",

      "Those symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently, as well as a slow or weak urinary stream.",
      "Screening for prostate cancer is part of routine presidential health inspections, according to Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, former White House doctor under President Barack Obama.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, according to the American Cancer Society, behind lung cancer.",
      "There will be more than 300,000 new cases in the US this year, according to projections by the American Cancer Society. About one in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.",
      "While it is \"not uncommon\" for men in their 80s to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the grade and stage of Biden's cancer are \"more advanced than most men would encounter\" at diagnosis, Dr Ryan Cleary, urologist at MedStar Health, told the BBC.",
      "What is the Gleason score?",
      "The former president's prostate cancer is \"characterised by a Gleason score of 9\", his office said in the statement announcing his diagnosis.",
      "In the US, the Gleason score is a common way of grading the capacity for cells from the primary tumour to spread round the body - also known as metastatic cancer.",
      "Specifically, it refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look in a sample under a microscope. The scale runs from six to 10, with a higher number indicating a more aggressive cancer.",
      "The scale starts at six because it is calculated by combining the two most common patterns of cancer cells found in a patient. The lowest score assigned to cancerous cells is three. That's why the lowest Gleason score for a cancer diagnosis is six.",
      "A Gleason score of nine, such as Biden's, means it is a \"high-grade cancer\". Cancer cells with a score of nine look very abnormal and are likely to grow quickly.",
      "What are Biden's treatment options?",
      "Biden's cancer is aggressive in nature and has already spread to his bones.",
      "According to Dr Jamin Vinod Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health Medical Group, this level of spread does limit the treatment options.",
      "While there are medical based treatments such as chemotherapy, steroids and hormone therapy available, none of them are \"curative\", he said.",
      "\"There are more medical options to stabilise the patient and control the cancer, but it never gets rid of the cancer completely.\"",
      "Biden's cancer is also said to be hormone sensitive, which means the cancer uses hormones to grow or develop.",
      "These types of cancers can be managed by drugs that block or lower the amount of hormones in the body.",
      "Dr Brahmbhatt said while this \"opens up the toolkit\" of treatment options for Biden, it was going to take \"weeks or months\" to see how he responds.",
      "Dr Kuhlman said Biden could also have the option of entering \"clinical trials for advanced disease\" if he meets the inclusion criteria.",
      "Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options.",
      "What is his prognosis?",
      "In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said since the cancer appeared to be hormone-sensitive, that \"allows for effective management\".",
      "The full details of Biden's case are not known. Dr Cleary said: \"Generally, about a third of patients will still be alive after five years of metastatic prostate cancer.\"",
      "However, advanced stages of prostate cancer can limit a person's lifespan and lead to symptoms that make daily life harder.",
      "Dr Kuhlman said it was important to consider treatments that maintain Biden's quality of life in the next few years.",
      "\"If there's any inspiration in this, it is to go and get yourself checked out whether you have symptoms or not,\" Dr Brahmbhatt said.",

      "\"How far away is it? What is the route? I somehow forget how to drive.\"",
      "She suffers from panic attacks and her fear of driving means she is constantly cancelling plans.",
      "But, over the course of six sessions with psychotherapist Owen O'Kane, it becomes clear her problems are much deeper than just a fear of driving.",
      "Digging around in the mind",
      "Every week, one in six of the UK population experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and every year more than 1.2 million people seek help from the NHS talking therapies service, with many more paying for support privately.",
      "This form of therapy is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, but can also help with a range of other problems, including body image dysmorphia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. It does not work for everyone: research suggests one-third of people do not benefit.",
      "The BBC has followed 12 people, featured in the series Change Your Mind, Change Your Life, who each received six support sessions from therapists.",
      "The therapists have used a combination of different talking therapy approaches, including cognitive behavioural therapy which focuses on changing the way we think and behave, alongside other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma.",
      "What it reveals is striking: How understanding and learning to manage the mind has the power to transform lives.",
      "\"You're not stuck with the brain you've got,\" says Owen O'Kane, who has worked in the field for 25 years.",
      "He describes his job as like detective work: \"People come with what seems to be a reasonable story, but the interesting thing is that very often the story and emotions don't match. I guess what we are doing is digging around a little bit.\"",
      "'I completely hated myself'",
      "Over their sessions, Owen digs deeper into Nicole's anxiety. At one point she weeps. She admits in the past she has \"completely hated\" herself. She worries about what people think of her and is socially anxious: \"I don't feel good enough to be there. I might say something wrong. I need people to like me.\"",
      "Owen questions why she feels like this: \"As human beings we like the nice emotions. We like feeling happy, joy, being in love.\" but he says some people try to avoid or suppress emotions like fear, dread and sadness, and that can cause anxiety. Instead, he says it is healthier to accept them and accept them as safe.",
      "When people get to that point, he says, they start to feel empowered: \"They realise they're not going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "Speaking outside the therapy room, Nicole says: \"I'm shocked. He got my number straight away. I would see vulnerability as a negative thing, but it's not.\"",
      "Asked to describe herself she uses words such as kind, thoughtful, determined and enthusiastic: \"I am not a bad person,\" she tells Owen.",
      "She says she has learned a lot: \"Most importantly I found I wasn't being kind to myself. That was really eye-opening.\"",
      "Owen says this is typical of many people he treats: \"When people get to these crossroads, when they wake up and realise what they are doing, that's a gold dust moment for me.\"",

      "He has been supported by Prof Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who explains perfectionism is at the root of his problems: \"If we think it's the end of the world if we make a mistake, it paralyses you.\"",

      "\"It made me feel a lesser man.\"",
      "Now he fears under-performing at work and losing his job.",
      "Over the course of the sessions, Prof Peters explains the key is James's belief system.",
      "First, he gives some seemingly simple advice: \"Put your feet on the floor, stand up and walk,\" he says.",
      "Focusing on the basic task of moving, in James's case moving so he can get to work, enables someone caught up in catastrophic thinking to block out the negative thoughts that stop them doing something.",
      "In later sessions, James and Prof Peters explore what could be behind his problems. James tells Prof Peters about his childhood and how his father would criticise him to push him to improve.",
      "Prof Peters explains how James believes that to please you cannot make errors and then the devastating stroke he suffered at a young age has triggered an absolute desire for things to never go wrong again.",
      "He tells James he needs to make \"peace with himself\" by defining himself not by performance but by values and behaviours. He too asks James to describe himself and James replies he is hard-working, honest, engaging, friendly and as someone who would put others first.",

      "Her psychotherapist, Julia Samuel, explains to Anjalee she has not been able to process what has happened and, as a result, the trauma has stayed with her.",
      "When her mother died, Anjalee was in the middle of exams and had two younger siblings, leaving her without time to grieve.",
      "Julia suggests eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, which uses movement to help people process and recover from distressing events.",
      "Julia asks Anjalee for her worst memory and she describes how her father tried to save her mother's life by performing chest compressions in their home until the paramedics arrived. Her mother was rushed out with Anjalee hoping she would return. She never did.",
      "Anjalee says she has never talked about this within anyone. Julia asks Anjalee to cross her arms against her chest and start deep breathing and tapping, mimicking a butterfly's wings flapping. She talks through the memory and how the images in her head are changing to more positive ones.",
      "Julia says this type of treatment is particularly effective when dealing with one single traumatic event. One memory, she says, can act as a block on everything.",
      "Afterwards, Anjalee speaks about how her symptoms have eased and the contentment she now feels.",
      "\"My therapist helped me reconnect with the 15-year-old girl I'd silenced. I began to process the trauma that haunted me. I now understand grief as the other side of love.\"",

    "summary": "The move is among several tweaks to the assisted dying bill which were debated by MPs.",
    "story": [
      "No one would be forced to help with the process of assisted dying against their wishes, under changes approved by MPs.",
      "A bill which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, expected to die within six months, to seek help to end their own life is currently being considered by Parliament.",
      "The legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last November \u2013 but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides.",
      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",
      "Under a change proposed by Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, and approved by MPs, this has been expanded say no one would have to take part in the process, giving protections to any staff who might be involved.",
      "It specifically mentions social care workers and pharmacists as among those covered.",

      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "MPs scrap judge sign-off in assisted dying bill",
      "During an emotionally charged - and at times ill-tempered - debate, supporters of the bill argued it had been strengthened by earlier changes.",
      "Opening the proceedings, Leadbeater said many people had \"lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances\".",
      "The MP for Spen Valley added: \"Put simply, if we do not vote to change the law, we are essentially saying that the status quo is acceptable.\"",
      "But opponents said the bill had been rushed through and needed stronger protections for people who could be vulnerable to coercion.",
      "Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued there should be a focus on improving end-of-life care, rather than assisted dying.",
      "\"[The bill] will harm far more people than it will help,\" Paul said.",
      "\"And those people who will be harmed are among the most vulnerable in our communities and I'm not willing to accept this collateral damage.\"",
      "At points the debate became tetchy, with some criticising how the process had been conducted.",
      "Labour MP Jess Asato accused campaigner and broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen of being \"distasteful and disrespectful\" for accusing the bill's opponents of having \"undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy\" their concerns.",
      "However, Dame Esther's daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast she was worried about the \"scaremongering\", \"blatant lies\" and \"myths\" circulating about the bill.",
      "She said that while she appreciated there were concerns over coercion and how the proposed legislation could affect vulnerable or disabled people, the bill was \"full of safeguards\".",
      "Labour former minister Anneliese Dodds was among those to raise fears people could feel under pressure to go through with an assisted death because they do not want to be a \"burden\".",
      "Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argued doctors should not be allowed to raise the option of assisted dying with patients first.",
      "She told the Commons this \"presents a serious risk that terminally ill patients already highly vulnerable will feel pressured into ending their lives\".",
      "But Conservative MP Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a former surgeon, said \"highly trained\" medical professionals must be trusted \"to have the difficult and complex conversations that they do every day\".",
      "Several MPs raised concerns people with anorexia could be considered terminally ill and eligible for assisted dying if they refuse to eat or drink.",
      "However, Leadbeater argued this risk was \"negligible\".",
      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",
      "Labour MP Jonathan Hinder is the latest to reveal he will no longer support the bill, saying his concerns have \"deepened\" as it has progressed.",
      "He gave the example of removing the role of a High Court judge as one reason he had changed his mind, adding that more work was needed to make the bill \"practicable and safe\".",

      "\"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\"",

      "Hospitals and care homes",
      "In the first six months of Covid, there was a frantic drive to increase testing for the disease. Matt Hancock set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020 in England.",
      "By this time it had become clear to scientists across the world that Covid could be spread by people who had not developed symptoms, such as a cough or fever.",

      "The Frances Crick Institute, headquartered in north London, is one of the largest biomedical research centres in the world.",
      "As Covid hit, a team of 300 volunteers started using the organisation's laboratory space and equipment to process Covid tests for dozens of hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes in the local area.",
      "It had the capacity to carry out 4,000 tests a day and to increase that to 10,000 with more funding, according to Prof Nurse.",
      "In March 2020, he wrote to the government offering to help with the national testing effort.",
      "Instead ministers decided to set up a network of giant privately-run Lighthouse laboratories.",
      "In his evidence, Prof Nurse accepted that the larger sites were needed, but said \"insufficient attention\" was paid to universities and other publicly-funded institutions, which could have quickly processed tests for healthcare workers, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic.",

      "More than nine million pensioners lost out on payments worth up to \u00a3300 after Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year.",
      "Discussions in government have included changing the threshold at which pensioners stop receiving the benefit, or restoring the payments to all pensioners.",
      "The talks are understood to be fluid, and have not yet reached a conclusion.",
      "The government may ultimately decide to stick with its existing policy.",
      "No 10 resists Labour calls for winter fuel rethink",
      "Winter fuel payments scrapped for millions",

      "The i newspaper has reported the government is considering whether to increase the \u00a311,500 income threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the allowance.",
      "Some Labour MPs have blamed the winter fuel policy for the party's losses at last month's local elections, and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election.",
      "Simply abandoning the policy entirely is seen as a less likely outcome than adjusting the thresholds.",
      "However, the fact that this policy - one of the first decisions made by Labour upon entering office last last summer - is even under review shows the scale of concern in Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's team about its political impact.",

      "At a meeting of Labour MPs that month, Reeves told Labour backbenchers: \"It is the right thing to do, to target money at a time when finances are so stretched, at people who need them most.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman told reporters there \"will not be a change to the government's policy\" on the winter fuel payment, despite growing calls within Labour ranks for a rethink.",
      "Some MPs raised questions about the payment as they grilled Sir Keir at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of that meeting, Labour MP Stella Creasy said it would be \"remiss\" of the government to dismiss concerns over the winter fuel payment.",
      "\"Those concerns are being heard across the party,\" Creasy said.",
      "\"Those of us who have been around a long time and among new MPs, there's a genuine concern to get this right and that's now what the government needs to respond to.\"",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over-80s, paid in November or December.",
      "Last year, the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid to save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "It was seen as a key issue at this month's local elections, at which Labour lost 187 council seats and control of the only council it was defending.",
      "The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners.",
      "It was billed as a way to guarantee they would be able to pay for increased heating costs over the winter - although in practice it is a pension top-up, which recipients can spend on whatever they want.",
      "This year state pensions are going up by 4.1% - a rise of \u00a3363 a year for those on the basic pension, or \u00a3472 for those on the new pension.",

      "One diplomatic source said it amounted to a rollover of the existing terms agreed as part of the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in 2019.",

      "Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.04% of UK GDP, but British control over its fishing waters was a big issue in the Brexit campaign.",

    "summary": "MPs have already overturned calls for more copyright protection for artists against AI once before.",
    "story": [
      "The House of Lords has dealt a second defeat to the government over its Data (Use and Access) Bill.",
      "Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once.",
      "MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to \"piecemeal\" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright.",
      "However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the \"whisperings of Silicon Valley\" asking them to \"redefine theft\".",
      "The Lords rebellion follows condemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government \"losers\" over the weekend and said ministers would be \"committing theft\" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying.",
      "He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material.",
      "Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work.",
      "Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans \"extraordinary\".",
      "\"There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,\" she said.",
      "\"The government has got it wrong.",
      "\"They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output.",
      "\"Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen.\"",
      "Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was \"the minimum viable action from the government\" to signal that \"UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land\".",
      "Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a \"political gesture\" ignoring \"widespread theft\" of UK copyright and \"starving\" the creative industry of \"the transparency they need to survive\".",
      "Sir Elton John angry at 'criminal' AI plans for artists",
      "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
      "She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up \"a double standard\" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright.",
      "\"This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,\" he said.",
      "\"I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else.\"",
      "Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed \"the clarion cry of this country's creators\".",
      "A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to \"protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech\" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as \"taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI\".",
      "The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation \"burglary\".",
      "\"The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,\" he said.",
      "\"If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries.\"",
      "Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had \"slogged away, struggled and suffered\" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her \"tenacity and dogged determination\" to ensure \"creativity will not be stolen\".",
      "Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting \"this isn't about Silicon Valley\", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that \"no other territory has cracked this either\".",
      "\"We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,\" she said.",
      "\"Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments...",
      "\"Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world.\"",
      "However, Kidron said her amendment \"does not challenge the primacy of the Commons\" and pushed ahead.",
      "The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.",

      "If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU.",
      "If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life.",
      "But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.",

      "BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers.",
      "Food",
      "Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks",
      "Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached",
      "Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU \u2013 including food products \u2013 have faced new checks and extra paperwork.",
      "Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules.",
      "UK food exports to the EU have fallen \u2013 with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 \u2013 and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape.",
      "Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers.",
      "If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats.",
      "Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023 were worth \u00a314bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales.",
      "But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards \u2013 a system known as \"dynamic alignment\" \u2013 and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area.",
      "The UK will also have to make a financial contribution. However it is currently unknown how much this will be and when it will be required.",
      "Fishing",
      "Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters",
      "Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access",
      "Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy - just 0.04% of GDP in 2024 - it is politically sensitive.",
      "The \"reset\" document notes \"political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038\" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.",
      "Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.",

      "UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",

      "Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended.",
      "Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: \"This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.\"",
      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",
      "In 2023, the UK exported \u00a31.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports.",
      "Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would \"speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market\".",
      "Youth mobility",
      "Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two",
      "Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary",
      "The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30.",
      "However, the impact of what is being called a \"youth experience scheme\" could be uneven.",
      "Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.",
      "And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to \"significantly\" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels.",
      "Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive.",
      "However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.",
      "\"If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,\" she said.",
      "eGates",
      "Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when",
      "Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer",
      "As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer.",
      "The government claims: \"British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.\"",
      "However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the \"potential use of eGates where appropriate\".",
      "It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.",
      "Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.",
      "EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders.",
      "Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says.",
      "Defence",
      "Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund",
      "Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues",
      "The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm.",
      "This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK.",
      "The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directly employs about164,00 people in the UK.",
      "Between 2020 and 2024, the UK was estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute to have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter.",
      "Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund.",

    "summary": "The deal paves the way for more common ground with the EU, but only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
    "story": [
      "There was much fanfare  - and then lunch on the Thames - to mark the \"reset\" of the relationship between the UK and the EU with claims of a \"huge\" potential boost to growth.",
      "The deal does represent a  significant breakthrough in deepening ties in the UK's most important trading relationship and paves the way for more gains while still allowing scope for pursuing other trade deals.",
      "But ultimately what has been agreed so far only dismantles a fraction of the trade barriers erected post-Brexit.",
      "Those producing and selling foodstuffs between Britain and the EU, in particular, are celebrating a reduction in red tape and checks.",
      "The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago. By agreeing to follow EU rules, the government has faced accusations of selling out on sovereignty. But it will smooth the path for over 1,500 products crossing borders.",
      "The new UK-EU deal at a glance",
      "Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)",
      "For more than four years, those selling agricultural products from Britain to the EU have had to comply with extra certification and checks, intended to prevent the spread of disease and ensure food safety.",
      "Amid frequent complaints of forms stretching to dozens of pages and fish and other perishables rotting in transit, the Food & Drink Federation claims that exports of such items to the EU have dropped by a third since 2019.",
      "Small companies were particularly likely to conclude it wasn't worth the effort; the variety of products being exported was reduced as costs increased. Formalities on items coming into the UK, too, have been ramped up, albeit more gradually.",
      "By doing away with some of the paperwork and inspections, the government claims this agreement - and the one centred on energy - will be worth \u00a38.9bn to the UK by 2040.",
      "Those predictions are always uncertain but that's roughly equivalent to 0.3% of GDP - helpful but not quite the \"huge\" boost to growth it claims. And that would recoup only a small  fraction of the 4% of GDP the government's own independent forecasters reckon has been foregone as a result of  Brexit.",
      "What about prices?",
      "Some studies suggest that greater red tape has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported from the EU in recent years.",
      "And while retailers are among those welcoming this deal, it's not guaranteed that any savings in costs will be passed on. Although the deal could limit the degree of future increases in prices, that depends on suppliers passing on savings.",
      "The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. That sector represents just 0.04% of GDP, but clearly this will be a big disappointment to some fishing communities, concerned by an encroachment of rights. However, exports of fish to the EU have fallen by 29% over the course of just a few  years - the SPS agreement is likely to help reverse that loss.",
      "What's been agreed in detail so far may not provide the \"huge\" boost to growth the government wants, but there is more that should be ahead.",
      "The youth mobility scheme could deliver significant gains, depending on the details that are hammered out, as could the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.",
      "But even those are unlikely to repair even the majority of the damage to growth some economists reckon Brexit has caused.",
      "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasters, had reckoned that as a result of Brexit GDP will be the equivalent of 4% lower than it could have been. That's the equivalent of costing the economy \u00a3100bn per year.",
      "Fully compensating for that, analysts reckon, would involve the UK rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement - all of which the government reiterated today are \"red lines\" it's not prepared to cross.",
      "But there is still a very significant triumph the government can claim. In a short period of time, it has tied up trade agreements with India and the US - and struck this improved deal with the EU.",
      "The latter, in particular, may have been given added impetus by President Trump's trade hostility.",
      "Knowing it perhaps could rely less on that traditional ally across the Atlantic may not have driven the EU and UK into each others arms, but it likely added a new focus on working to break down barriers previously thought insurmountable.",
      "Moreover, the UK has achieved something many commentators thought not possible in the early years of Brexit, securing a deal (albeit limited) with the US without lowering food standards and so managing to align with EU rules.",
      "This deal may not be a huge growth gamechanger. But it paves the way for reaching more common ground with the EU while allowing the UK to strengthen ties with the US on services, in particular financial services, and technology - areas of growing importance for British firms doing business with America.",
      "And that strategic focus on building on our economic strength is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time of geopolitical uncertainty"

      "Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports.",
      "The agreement was described as \"disastrous\" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a \"great betrayal of our fishing fleet\".",
      "But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a \"slashing of red tape\" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU.",
      "The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a \"win-win\".",
      "He said it would \"tear down\" barriers to trade and end the \"needlessly difficult\" process of selling Scottish products in Europe.",
      "Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe.",
      "\"This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. \"",
      "The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added.",
      "Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which \"unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict\".",
      "But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal.",
      "\"Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,\" she said.",
      "The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters.",
      "It was due to expire at the end of June 2026 but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038.",
      "The deal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch.",
      "But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any \"leverage\" the UK has in future negotiations.",
      "She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet.",
      "\"The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal.",
      "\"But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to.",
      "\"We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants.\"",
      "Cutting 'red tape'",
      "While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries.",
      "Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market.",
      "The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record \u00a3844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the \"Label Rouge\" quality mark, the largest market at \u00a3462m.",
      "Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile.",
      "\"This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,\" he said.",
      "\"Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond.\"",
      "The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EU banned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops to its member states in 2021.",
      "Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants.",
      "'Sold down the river'",
      "Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an \"utter betrayal\".",
      "He said it was the \"third time\" the fishing industry had been \"sold down the river,\" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020.",
      "Mr Park said: \"We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it.",
      "\"But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a \"surrender\" and \"one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland.\"",
      "She said: \"Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities.\"",
      "The UK government also announced a \u00a3360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement.",
      "It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to \"revitalise\" coastal communities.",
      "About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry, according to a Scottish government report published in 2023.",
      "In 2022, it brought \u00a3335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead.",
      "The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs and brought in \u00a3337m to the Scottish economy in 2022.",

    "story": [
      "There could be a second Scottish independence referendum if the public show \"overwhelming support\" for one, according to Michael Gove.",
      "The former Conservative minister, who sat in the cabinet for most of the period between 2010 and 2024, told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that he didn't think another referendum was necessary.",
      "But he conceded that the UK government may have to change approach if SNP popularity and support for another vote grows.",
      "Last week, First Minister John Swinney said that he wanted to achieve \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "UK is a 'living thing'",
      "Gove, who held various cabinet positions under three Conservative prime ministers, was often tasked with overseeing relations between the UK and Scottish government.",
      "While he doesn't think Scottish independence is currently on the agenda, he is warning supporters of the union not to \"assume any degree of complacency.\"",
      "Gove described the UK as a \"living thing\" and added that politicians had to continually demonstrate that the union was working.",
      "The former minister said that he didn't think a second referendum was \"necessary at the moment\", but added that if there was \"an overwhelming desire on the part of the Scottish people for one then we'd have to review the decision.\"",
      "When pressed on what would trigger such a change in policy, Gove said that was for the Westminster government to decide.",
      "He added that he believed too much focus on the constitution was bad for all political parties and that governments should \"retain confidence\" by concentrating on the economy, health and transport.",
      "Gove was part of a government that rejected requests from the Scottish government for a second referendum.",
      "He denied that this was anti-democratic and insisted that Scotland had \"more important\" issues to deal with.",
      "Gove now suggests that the likelihood of a second independence vote was linked to the SNP's ability to improve public services.",
      "\"If, for the sake of argument, the SNP make all of those decisions in government in a way that gives people confidence in them then we might be in a different position [on a second referendum]\", he said.",
      "Michael Gove and SNP leader John Swinney do not have much in common politically, but they seem to be delivering a relatively similar message on this topic.",
      "Last week, the first minister talked about securing \"demonstrable support\" for independence.",
      "Swinney compared this to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament, which was backed by around 74% of Scots.",
      "The message seemed to be that independence will move forward when public support demands it in greater numbers.",
      "But the first minister also told BBC Scotland News that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for the independence movement \"to be thwarted by a Westminster government that just folds its arms and says 'no'.\"",
      "Gove is no stranger to disagreements with Scottish government ministers.",
      "He insists that relations were broadly cordial and productive when he was in government. But it's fair to say there were times when relationships soured.",
      "Back in 2023, the UK government made the unprecedented decision to veto Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill.",
      "This legislation would have made it easier for trans people to 'self-identify' and change their legally recognised sex, without a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.",
      "Gove chaired a committee of ministers who agreed to enact Section 35 of the Scotland Act.",
      "This allows a UK minister to veto a Holyrood bill if they think it would modify laws reserved to Westminster and have an \"adverse effect\" on how those laws apply.",
      "This power had never been used before and it has not been used since.",
      "Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the term 'woman' related to biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "And Gove believes this proved that deploying the section 35 order was the correct call.",
      "\"I think it was absolutely the right decision, and I think it's been vindicated by subsequent events\", he added.",
      "Though Mr Gove stressed that the Section 35 provision must remain a \"fail safe power\" that is \"used sparingly\".",
      "At the time the Scottish government characterised the veto as a \"direct attack\" on the Scottish Parliament.",

      "That reassurance may go down well with both UK party leader Kemi Badenoch and Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay, who must scale political mountains if they are to deliver success.",

      "\"These people know they are not welcome and never will be,\" they added.",

      "He pointed to Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick's recent comments that in Dagenham the \"British population has reduced by 50% in the last 25 years\" as proof.",
      "\"We won't be dropping our policies, our anti-Zionism, our anti-Net Zero,\" Collett added.",

      "On Friday MPs debated further potential changes, which also included preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with a patient first.",
      "However, MPs ran out of time to vote on more changes, so further debate and voting will take place on 13 June.",
      "That would be followed by a vote on whether to pass the bill as a whole to its next stage or reject it, either on the same day or a future date.",
      "The government is neutral on the bill and MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line.",
      "The original bill stated that no registered medical practitioner or other health professional would be under any obligation to participate in the process of assisted dying and they could not be discriminated by their employer if they did not wish to do so.",

      "\"Not only would someone with severe anorexia be highly unlikely to be assessed to have capacity to make a decision about assisted dying, the other tragic reality is that if a patient was so ill as a result of not eating and drinking for whatever reason, they would die before the process of assisted dying would be able to take place,\" she told MPs.",
      "A proposal from Labour MP Naz Shah would amend the bill so an individual would not meet the requirements for an assisted death \"solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking\".",
      "Leadbeater indicated she would support this but suggested further changes may be needed to make the proposal workable.",
      "Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle by 330 to 275 votes back in November.",
      "Since then, the bill has gone through six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and several changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death. Instead, a panel of experts - including a legal professional, psychiatrist and social worker - would oversee the process.",
      "The issue has split Parliament, with strong opinions on both sides.",
      "Those opposed to assisted dying say the mood has altered among MPs, but so far only a handful have said they have changed their minds since November and it would take dozens to block the bill.",

      "On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.",
      "It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.",
      "The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and \u2013 for the first time since Brexit \u2013 a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.",
      "The British government believes it's a significant moment.",
      "Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.",
      "Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".",
      "Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?",
      "Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?",
      "Questions around a security pact",
      "In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed \u2013 a notable omission, some think.",
      "Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.",
      "Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [\u2026] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"",
      "Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.",
      "\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"",
      "Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"",
      "The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.",
      "Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.",
      "Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.",
      "\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.",
      "The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".",
      "Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2013 at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.",
      "So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?",
      "No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"",
      "Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.",
      "Delays at the border",
      "More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.",
      "Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.",
      "One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.",
      "\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"",
      "It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.",
      "But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.",
      "\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.",
      "The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" \u2013 and that this should not now be reversed.",
      "Step change or 'sell out'?",
      "Reform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.",
      "\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"",
      "But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".",
      "His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.",
      "David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".",
      "\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"",
      "A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".",
      "Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" \u2013 but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.",
      "'Tough it out' on fishing?",
      "After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.",
      "David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.",
      "\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"",
      "So he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.",
      "But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.",
      "Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.",
      "Immigration and youth mobility",
      "And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.",
      "For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal \u2013 but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".",
      "It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.",
      "Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.",
      "The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.",
      "\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".",
      "Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration \u2013 small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.",
      "\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"",
      "Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.",
      "Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious \u2013 and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"",
      "'Making Brexit work'",
      "Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.",
      "\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [\u2026] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"",
      "Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"",
      "But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.",
      "Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".",

      "Tice said he agreed with her.",

      "It is ranked 152 out of 183 for civil liberties on the international table maintained by Sweden's Varieties of Democracy Institute.",
      "Pressed that the UAE did not share Western values, Tice said: \"No-one's saying everything's perfect about it\", but added: \"Our basic British values at the moment are not working\".",
      "\"Crime is through the roof, people who commit crimes are not being required to serve proper justice,\" he said.",
      "\"Foreign criminals are blocking up our jails - so yeah, the country is not working for British citizens.",
      "\"And that's why they voted for Reform in massive numbers where they're allowed to vote.\"",
      "Reform won most votes, most seats and overall control of the most councils at the local elections in England on 1 May, where it also took the Runcorn and Helsby constituency off Labour in a tightly-fought by-election.",
      "Elsewhere in the interview, Tice suggested he would like to become chancellor if Reform UK leader Nigel Farage were to become prime minister.",
      "\"I enjoy dealing with money,\" Tice said.",

    "story": [
      "Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist?",
      "They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists \u2013 who are several years ahead.",
      "The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.",
      "The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).",
      "The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison.",
      "The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as \"cathedrals to science\".",
      "Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.",
      "\"We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,\" he says.",
      "When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter \u2013 from which stars, planets and everything around us are made \u2013 and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.",
      "Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we \u2013 as matter \u2013 are.",
      "Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won \u2013\u00a0and we exist \u2013 lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.",
      "They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.",
      "This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.",
      "The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.",
      "Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be \"transformative\" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.",
      "\"It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,\" she said.",
      "Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K.",
      "The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.",
      "\"We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,\" he says.",
      "Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, \"I would like to get there first!\"",
      "But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.",
      "\"There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently.\"",
      "The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery \u2013 for now.",

      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",

    "summary": "Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour.",
    "story": [
      "Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse \u2013 cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly.",
      "And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour.",
      "They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours.",
      "The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research.",
      "The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.",
      "It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now.",
      "Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous papers published on Thursday.",
      "What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active.",
      "Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function.",
      "By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene.",
      "Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.",
      "Ginger cats mostly male",
      "For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
      "Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes.",
      "As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger.",
      "In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely.",
      "\"These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,\" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University.",

      "Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.",
      "The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.",
      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",
      "He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.",
      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",

      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",
      "Are the dry conditions linked to climate change?",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

    "summary": "The goal of limiting warming to 1.5C is too high to avoid continued sea-level rise, scientists warn.",
    "story": [
      "The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several meters or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned.",
      "Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered \"safe\" for coastal populations.",
      "They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past.",
      "But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks.",
      "The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities.",
      "But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say.",
      "\"Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,\" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University.",
      "The 2015 Paris climate agreement saw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises \"well below\" 2C - and ideally 1.5C.",
      "That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is \"safe\", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years.",
      "The authors of the new paper, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case.",
      "First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting \u2013 with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago.",
      "And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher.",
      "Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year.",
      "\"Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,\" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre.",
      "East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable.",
      "\"We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,\" added Prof Stokes.",
      "Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good.",
      "\"Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,\" said Prof Stokes.",
      "The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond \"tipping points\" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit.",
      "\"The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication.",
      "\"This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,\" he added.",
      "An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines.",
      "Defining a \"safe\" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others.",
      "But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say.",
      "\"If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],\" argued Prof Bamber.",
      "However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say.",
      "\"The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,\" said Prof Stokes.",

      "The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.",
      "Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be \"shut down\" without government help over energy pricing.",
      "Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose \u00a3100m this year, and it wants to invest \u00a32bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.",
      "The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.",
      "The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.",
      "It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.",
      "The company is seeking a \"cap and floor\" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.",
      "\"What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock \u00a32bn of investment,\" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.",
      "\"It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.\"",
      "Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned \"and we'll lose this resilience\".",
      "He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.",
      "\"So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.\"",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, \"we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers\".",
      "UK has enough gas, says network after storage warning",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not \"materially\" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.",
      "He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a \"huge economic opportunity\".",
      "However he added that \"the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments\".",
      "\"Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.\"",
      "He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was \"very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target\".",
      "\"It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.\"",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses.",
      "The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century.",
      "Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales.",
      "The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.",
      "The next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group.",
      "That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way.",
      "The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt.",
      "Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year.",
      "\"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk.",
      "He had to start irrigating his fields in March.",
      "\"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said.",
      "He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported.",
      "The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year.",
      "The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s.",
      "Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation.",
      "That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather.",
      "However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on.",
      "But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.",
      "Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues.",
      "At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be.",
      "There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week.",
      "Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions.",
      "Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies.",
      "By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies.",
      "Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas.",
      "If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes.",
      "In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976.",
      "Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought.",
      "Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed.",
      "And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.",
      "Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m.",
      "It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions.",
      "But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult.",
      "A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs.",
      "He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"",
      "Are the dry conditions linked to climate change?",
      "The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called \"blocking highs\" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck.",
      "Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change.",
      "Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally.",
      "Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer.",
      "That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.",

      "The UK's climate change advisors have criticised the handling of a switch to greener steelmaking at the country's largest plant in Port Talbot, which resulted in huge job losses.",
      "Government ministers should have been better at planning ahead and making sure other green jobs were available locally, the experts said.",
      "The independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) has set out its latest advice on how Wales reaches net zero - with a push for more electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting.",
      "The Welsh and UK governments said they had been working together to develop \"a strong vision\" for the region's future and deliver \"our clean energy superpower mission\".",
      "How the political consensus on climate change has shattered",
      "What Tata's plans mean for UK's carbon footprint",
      "Climate change in Wales in charts",
      "More than 2,000 jobs were lost at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks following the closure of its blast furnaces in 2024.",
      "The move brought an end to traditional steelmaking at the site, as the company grappled with losses of over \u00a31m a day.",
      "It was given a \u00a3500m grant by the UK government and is now investing \u00a31.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027.",
      "This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site.",
      "The changes will have a dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gases from Wales.",
      "The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC.",
      "But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry.",
      "In its report, the CCC said there were \"important lessons to learn\", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared.",
      "\"The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,\" they argued.",
      "The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened \"early and collaborative\" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said.",
      "The Welsh government could have ensured \"the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure\", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind.",
      "The committee said Port Talbot's experience should now be used \"to guide future efforts to decarbonise other strategically and locally-significant emissions-intensive industries,\" citing Pembroke's oil refineries as an example.",
      "Former steelworker Shaun Spencer, who now works for a firm training electrical engineers, said he agreed with the committee's comments \"100%\".",
      "He warned the feeling of \"resentment and bitterness\" was \"very strong\" among his former colleagues.",
      "He added the approach had been detrimental to \"everybody's views of net zero\" and to support for the way the UK and Welsh governments deal with things, \"especially in this area\".",
      "Emma Pinchbeck, the CCC's chief executive, told BBC news what had happened at Port Talbot was \"foreseeable and preventable\", and had \"not been the best case study\" for what a green transition should look like.",
      "How can Wales reach net zero?",
      "Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
      "The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how each UK nation might achieve this.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35.",
      "The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990.",
      "Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live.",
      "The CCC has made 16 \"priority\" recommendations for immediate action.",
      "These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport.",
      "By 2033 - in just eight years' time - a third of cars and vans on Welsh roads should be electric, the committee said, and nearly a quarter of existing homes need a heat pump or similar technology.",
      "'Fewer sheep and cattle'",
      "The committee also said the Welsh government will need to support farmers and rural communities to \"diversify their income\" away from livestock farming and towards woodland creation and peatland restoration.",
      "In 2022, agriculture was the third-highest emitting sector in Wales, accounting for 16% of Wales' emissions.",
      "Cattle and sheep numbers should fall by 19% by 2033 due to changes in agricultural policy but also a shift in diets with less meat and dairy consumed UK-wide, the report has predicted.",
      "The proportion of woodland cover across Wales will rise from 15% to 17% in 2033 and 26% by 2050, according to the committee's projections.",
      "Farming union NFU Cymru said the Welsh government needed to \"reflect and consider\" whether that advice fit \"with the circumstances we have in Wales\".",

    "story": [
      "Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.",
      "It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.",
      "The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet \u2013 assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.",
      "The pool \u2013 which is 12m deep (40ft) \u2013 contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a \"spacewalk\" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.",
      "\"It's a big day,\" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. \"It's very physically intense \u2013 and it's very psychologically intense.\"",
      "But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.",
      "Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.",
      "\"At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,\" Rosemary says. \"You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.\"",
      "So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.",
      "ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.",
      "Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.",
      "She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.",
      "\"It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside \u2013 to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.\"",
      "Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.",
      "\"The lower part is where you put your solid waste,\" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. \"And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.\"",
      "Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.",
      "\"There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.\"",
      "Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.",
      "Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.",
      "She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.",
      "Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.",
      "It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.",
      "\"You do a lot of mental preparation \u2013 you really think through every single movement,\" Rosemary explains. \"You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.\"",
      "Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.",
      "Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.",
      "\"When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,\" he says. \"It is baby steps, but they are moving forward \u2013 and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.\"",
      "Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V \u2013 the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.",
      "\"It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,\" she says.",
      "After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test \u2013 but then she's thrown a curve ball.",
      "In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.",
      "On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition \u2013 and tow him back to the airlock.",
      "After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is \u2013 but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.",
      "\"Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,\" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. \"We're really happy with where she's at \u2013 she's doing awesome.\"",
      "The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.",
      "\"It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,\" she tells us, \"But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.\"",
      "Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" Rosemary says, \"If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.\"",

      "People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: \"This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice.\"",
      "But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice.",
      "Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was \"coming home\" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so \"as soon as possible\".",
      "Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations.",
      "And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction.",
      "In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend \u00a340 to \u00a350 an hour).",
      "At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa.",
      "Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution?",
      "An 'inexperienced therapist'",
      "Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on \"large language models\" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data \u2013 whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions.",
      "The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback.",
      "Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an \"inexperienced therapist\", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and \"read\" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone.",
      "\"They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots.\"",
      "Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, \"so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you\". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable.",
      "And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on.",
      "Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many \"real-life\" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational.",
      "\"Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change.",
      "\"Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,\" he says.",
      "Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem.",
      "\"A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model.\"",
      "\"Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,\" she says.",
      "Lack of cultural context is another issue \u2013 Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset.",
      "\"These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being.\"",
      "Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying.",
      "\"Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it.\" At times \"it was like hitting a brick wall\".",
      "\"It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing [\u2026] and it just didn't want to get in depth.\"",
      "A Character.AI spokesperson said \"for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice\".",
      "'It was so empathetic'",
      "For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest.",
      "Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: \"When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years.\"",
      "He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist.",
      "\"My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live.\"",
      "While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits.",
      "\"As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better.\"",
      "The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool.",
      "Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation.",
      "For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7.",
      "Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep.",
      "\"There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'.",
      "\"It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years [\u2026] And it did make me feel valued.\"",
      "His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions.",
      "After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms \u2013 including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist.",
      "Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care.",
      "'A stop gap to these huge waiting lists'",
      "Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised.",
      "\"There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',\" says Kelly.",
      "Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns \"some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned\".",
      "\"Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to.\"",
      "\"It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested [\u2026] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,\" Mr MacRae says.",
      "Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa.",
      "\"Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models.\"",
      "Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. \"It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting.\"",
      "\"AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,\" agrees Mr Tench.",

      "23andMe said Regeneron had committed to comply with its privacy policies as part of the deal, and that Regeneron has security controls in place to protect user data.",
      "Last month, the firm agreed to have an ombudsman oversee the protection of user data in response to demands by several state attorneys general in the US.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 21:55:21 GMT",
    "summary": "An exclusive look inside the closely guarded factory the president wants to become a foundation stone for a US golden age.",
    "story": [
      "Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.",
      "The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.",
      "It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.",
      "Its Arizona facility \"Fab 21\" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing.",
      "They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products.",
      "But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.",
      "The poster child for Trump's policy",
      "President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. \"TSMC is the biggest there is,\" he has said. \"We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us.\" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.",
      "TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (\u00a375bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.",
      "The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.",
      "China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its \"Silicon Shield\", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.",
      "China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.",
      "So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy.",
      "He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.",
      "The cleanest environment on Earth",
      "Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. \"I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,\" he says.",
      "\"It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.\"",
      "Inside the \"Gowning Building\", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.",
      "Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as \"4 nanometre chips\".",
      "\"This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,\" he explains. \"[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.\"",
      "If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.",
      "Manufacturing manipulation of atoms",
      "TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.",
      "Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence.",
      "It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of \"extreme ultraviolet (UV) light\". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called \"lithography\".",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Gold is booming - but investors lured in by the hype could lose out, warn experts",
      "The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.",
      "These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors.",
      "The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.",
      "\"Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,\" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. \"The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.\"",
      "Caution in Taiwan",
      "Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.",
      "Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.",
      "He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.",
      "Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act.",
      "On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying \"a future Made in America\".",
      "\"The semiconductor supply chain is global,\" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. \"There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.\"",
      "'Non-Red' supply chains to counter China",
      "As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.",
      "That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.",
      "The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.",
      "There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.",
      "Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop \"non-Red\" supply chains to counter China.",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies \"have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead\".",
      "Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.",
      "So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.",

      "The following day, Wednesday 12 February, the government held a Cobra meeting, designed to co-ordinate the response to major emergencies.",
      "\"That's when you realised just how serious it was,\" the former council leader said. \"It wasn't just some hacker sat in a bedroom having a play with computers.\"",

    "summary": "The US-China trade \"reset\" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.",
    "story": [
      "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.",
      "Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.",
      "As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"",
      "The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.",
      "That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".",
      "\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".",
      "There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.",
      "Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.",
      "Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.",
      "For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.",
      "India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.",
      "India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.",
      "But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.",
      "Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month.",
      "\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"",
      "A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.",
      "The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.",
      "The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind.",
      "Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.",
      "\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.",
      "According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.",
      "\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.",
      "The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.",
      "Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme.",
      "Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.",
      "India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.",
      "But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.",
      "All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.",
      "\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post.",
      "\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\"",

    "summary": "BBC's Joe Tidy spoke directly to those who claim they are responsible for hacking M&amp;S and Co-op.",
    "story": [
      "Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes.",
      "The good, the bad, the not-so-sure.",
      "I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades.",
      "About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore.",
      "\"Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?\" the hackers messaged me on Telegram.",
      "\"We have some news for you,\" they teased.",
      "When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption.",
      "Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks.",
      "They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information.",
      "I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it.",
      "Messages that confirmed suspicions",
      "They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data.",
      "After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack.",
      "I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach.",
      "Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computer systems were infiltrated. The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began \u2013 the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce.",
      "Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues.",
      "DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion.",
      "This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service.",
      "The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year.",
      "Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings.",
      "Power struggle ensues",
      "DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example.",
      "The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company.",
      "\"DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,\" Ms Baumgaertner said.",
      "As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago.",
      "\"Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,\" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos.",
      "Who is pulling the strings?",
      "DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks.",
      "Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes.",
      "Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out.",
      "Of course, they are criminals and could be lying.",
      "Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money.",
      "And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use \u2013 who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers?",
      "In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police.",
      "Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums \u2013 hence the description \"scattered\" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike.",
      "They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young \u2013 in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based.",
      "Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too.",
      "As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. \"We won't answer that question\" is all they said.",
      "Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist.",
      "In a message to me, they boasted: \"We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist.\"",

    "summary": "Cooling systems that avoid the use of polluting refrigerants are being launched.",
    "story": [
      "Sneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up.",
      "Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling.",
      "Rising temperatures are even worse for outdoor workers. \"This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,\" Ms Sachar says.",
      "She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.",
      "For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.",
      "But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.",
      "Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (\u00a3180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.",
      "Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.",
      "It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.",
      "The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.",
      "So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems.",
      "For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.",
      "But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.",
      "Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".",
      "In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.",
      "Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".",
      "A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.",
      "Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".",
      "RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.",
      "One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.",
      "\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.",
      "The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.",
      "The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"",
      "The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.",
      "Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"",
      "He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.",
      "Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.",
      "This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.",
      "A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.",
      "Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.",
      "Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.",
      "\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.",
      "He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.",
      "But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements.",
      "\"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.",
      "Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"",
      "In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.",
      "A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.",
      "Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.",
      "At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.",
      "However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W\u2014the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.",
      "Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.",
      "She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.",
      "A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"",

      "We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.",
      "Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.",
      "All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.",
      "It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.",
      "Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.",
      "At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.",
      "You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator \u2013 there's a minuscule wobble \u2013 but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.",
      "It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.",
      "This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.",
      "The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.",
      "He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"",
      "Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.",
      "In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.",
      "Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes \u2013 but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.",
      "Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.",
      "He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.",
      "Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.",
      "Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"",
      "While Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional \u2013 the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.",
      "\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"",
      "He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.",
      "\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle \u2013 that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.",
      "The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.",
      "He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.",
      "There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming \u2013 increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.",
      "Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.",
      "Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.",
      "Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.",
      "The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"",
      "There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.",
      "Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.",
      "But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take \u2013 I want to watch these things because they're good.\"",

      "Netanyahu has hit back, saying the \"leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities\".",
      "He insisted the war could end if Hamas returned hostages, laid down its arms, agreed for its leaders to go into exile and Gaza was demilitarised. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu - who is sought under an International criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he has dismissed as \"antisemitic\" - had been under heavy international pressure to end the blockade of Gaza after a respected international survey warned of imminent famine.",
      "At the London summit between the EU and the UK the President of the European Council, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, called the humanitarian crisis in Gaza \"a tragedy where international law is being systematically violated, and an entire population is being subjected to disproportionate military force\".",

      "Only five trucks made it into Gaza on Monday, as Israeli troops advanced and air and artillery strikes killed more Palestinian civilians including many young children.",
      "Opponents of Israel's destruction of Gaza and the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians will say the governments of France, the UK and Canada are speaking out far too late.",
      "Many of them have held months of demonstrations protesting about the death and destruction in Gaza \u2013 and more killing of Palestinian civilians and confiscation of land in the West Bank, the other side of the Palestinian territories, during military operations and raids by armed Jewish settlers.",
      "But sometimes in the politics of war, a single incident carries symbolic power that clarifies and crystallises so sharply that it can force governments to action. This time it was the killing on 23 March by Israeli forces in Gaza of 15 paramedics and aid workers.",
      "It came after Israel, on 18 March, had broken a ceasefire that had held for two months with a series of massive air strikes.",
      "Five days into the renewed war an Israeli unit attacked the medical convoy, and covered the men they had killed and their bullet ridden vehicles with the sand. The Israeli account of what happened was shown to be untrue when a mobile phone was recovered from a body in the mass grave.",
      "Its owner had filmed the incident before he was killed. Far from proving Israel's claim that the emergency workers were a potential threat to the Israeli combat soldiers, the video from the grave showed that clearly marked and well-lit ambulances and emergency vehicles were attacked systematically until almost everyone inside them was killed.",
      "Alarm has been growing fast since then, not just among Israel's usual opponents. Its European allies, with President Macron of France leading the way, have been toughening their language. The statement calling for an end to Israel's offensive is their harshest criticism of Israel so far.",
      "A senior European diplomatic source involved in their discussions told me that the tough language reflected a \"real sense of growing political anger at the humanitarian situation, of a line being crossed, and of this Israeli government appearing to act with impunity\".",
      "More ominously for Israel, the statement says that \"we will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete steps in response\".",
      "They do not specify what those might be. Sanctions could be one possibility. A bigger step would be to recognise Palestine as an independent state.",
      "France has been considering joining the 148 other states that have done so at a conference it is co-chairing with Saudi Arabia in New York in early June. The UK has also talked about Palestinian recognition with the French.",
      "Israel, pushing back hard, has told them they would be presenting Hamas with a victory. But the tone of the statement made by the French, the Canadians and the British suggests that Israel is losing its ability to pressurise them."

      "Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.",

    "story": [
      "Some have called it an \"eyesaur\". Many more have described it as \"fabulous\".",
      "But one word Boom Boom, a seven-metre tall stainless steel dinosaur sculpture in New Zealand, could never be associated with is \"boring\".",
      "Just days after the sauropod statue was installed in Taup\u014d Sculpture Park, in the scenic centre of New Zealand's North Island, Boom Boom has already prompted heated debate among locals.",
      "The artist - and the team that commissioned it - say that's exactly the point.",
      "The mirror-finish sculpture was commissioned by the Taup\u014d Sculpture Trust and created by Slovenian-born artist Gregor Kregar.",
      "Kregar said that he wasn't \"particularly surprised\" by the furore that quickly surrounded his work.",
      "\"Sculpture sometimes stops people from their everyday interactions with the world,\" he told the BBC from his home in Auckland. \"It's really hard to hate a sculpture of a dinosaur.\"",
      "Still, public opinion on Boom Boom is split.",
      "\"Fantastic! Getting people talking about art. Broadening the conversation,\" said one commenter on a social media post announcing Boom Boom's arrival.",
      "But another wrote: \"Public investment of $100,000 from the local ratepayers, many of who would have rather seen the money spent elsewhere in the community.\"",
      "Funding for Boom Boom was finalised in 2018, before recent hikes in Taup\u014d District Council's rate which is similar to a council tax.",
      "After several years of negotiations, the work was completed and installed in the park last week.",
      "Others still criticised the work as having no connection with Taup\u014d, named New Zealand's most beautiful town in the 2023 Keep New Zealand Beautiful Awards.",
      "But Kregar said the rock that the dinosaur stands on is inspired by the volcanic history of the area.",
      "Lake Taup\u014d, from which the town takes its name, is a large caldera, a volcano that has collapsed in on itself. It last erupted around 1,800 years ago.",
      "Sauropods, the inspiration for Boom Boom, are one of a few species of dinosaurs that paleontologists say lived in New Zealand.",
      "They became extinct 66 million years ago, along with most other non-avian dinosaurs.",
      "Kregar says the spirited debate around the sculpture means Boom Boom could eventually win round \"the haters\".",
      "\"You put the sculpture out there, there is reaction, people start falling in love with it, and then it becomes something that they start embracing, part of the local identity,\" he said.",
      "Kim Gillies, secretary of the Taup\u014d Sculpture Trust, told the BBC that the decision to commission Boom Boom was not taken \"lightly\", but that it was chosen because \"it would help put Taup\u014d on the map\".",
      "Gillies added that when it comes to the art, \"safe is a bit boring, right?\"",
      "No bones about it."

      "The Trump administration wanted to end protections and work permits for migrants  with TPS in April 2025, more than a year before they were originally supposed to end in October 2026.",
      "Lawyers representing the US government argued the California federal court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, had undermined \"the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" when it stopped the administration from ending protections and work permits in April.",

      "\"That the Supreme Court authorized this action in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking,\" Mr Arulanantham said. \"The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court's decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 21:58:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets were battle tested for the first time during hostilities with India.",
    "story": [
      "The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory \u2013 but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.",
      "The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.",
      "Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.",
      "After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.",
      "India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.",
      "Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.",
      "\"Losses are a part of combat,\" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.",
      "\"We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,\" he added.",
      "India said it had killed at least \"100 terrorists\" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.",
      "A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.",
      "A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.",
      "Some of the experts have called this a \"DeepSeek moment\" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.",
      "\"The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,\" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.",
      "The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed \"China has some systems that are next to none\". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.",
      "Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.",
      "Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.",
      "\"In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,\" he said.",
      "Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.",
      "Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.",
      "Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.",
      "\"At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,\" she said.",
      "For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (\u00a337bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.",
      "So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.",
      "China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. \"It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,\" he said.",
      "Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.",
      "China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.",
      "Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets \u2013 jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 \u2013 due to technical malfunctions.",
      "The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.",
      "Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.",
      "In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.",
      "India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.",
      "Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an \"impressive breadth of targets\" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.",
      "The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.",
      "One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.",
      "Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.",
      "The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.",
      "\"It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,\" Mr Ladwig pointed out.",
      "Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military \"lost control of the narrative thread\".",
      "In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.",
      "Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.",
      "But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.",
      "Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.",
      "Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.",
      "India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.",
      "Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.",
      "For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.",

      "But for Romania things looked very different this morning.",
      "A vote for change",
      "Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades.",
      "But it was also the least extreme option for change.",
      "Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults.",
      "He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania.",
      "Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over.",
      "\"This time, fear managed to defeat fury,\" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout.",
      "\"Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards.",
      "\"It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power.\"",
      "'Romania first' rhetoric fell short",
      "I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days.",
      "When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags.",
      "They tended to talk about God and the \"traditional values\" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU \"imposing\" same-sex marriage on Romania.",
      "Other voters are drawn to Simion's \"Romania first\" rhetoric and promises of a better life.",
      "\"Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,\" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples.",
      "She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be \"so corrupt\".",
      "So when the results came in she was disappointed.",
      "\"I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?\" Liliana shrugged.",
      "\"I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan.\"",
      "Costly mistakes",
      "George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a \"man of my people\". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes.",
      "Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections.",
      "Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having \"dictatorial tendencies\" and said the country was run by \"the ayatollahs\".",
      "\"It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,\" Diana thinks. \"It made me change my vote.\"",
      "Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him \"autistic, poor guy\".",
      "\"Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,\" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote.",
      "\"I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that.\"",
      "Defiance of Russia",
      "For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling.",
      "At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: \"Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!\"",
      "They were referring to allegations that Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu.",
      "When he came from nowhere to win the first round, the vote was annulled.",
      "This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day.",
      "But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia \u2013 he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin \u2013 was a turn-off for many voters.",
      "European choice",
      "Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion.",
      "His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe.",
      "When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement.",
      "Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won.",
      "\"So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,\" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. \"I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU.\"",

      "She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be \"no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters\" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.",

    "story": [
      "Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale.",
      "Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation.",
      "Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the \"River of Death\" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die?",
      "Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer.",
      "Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as \"palaeo gold\".",
      "As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge.",
      "\"That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,\" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears.",
      "\"Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery.\"",
      "BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues.",
      "Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generating new discoveries.",
      "The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.",
      "These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, the four-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss.",
      "The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre.",
      "So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside.",
      "\"It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,\" she tells us.",
      "\"It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America.",
      "\"More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here.\"",
      "Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer.",
      "The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals.",
      "\"It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "Bigger beasts offering clues",
      "And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem.",
      "Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks.",
      "No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up.",
      "A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud.",
      "Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. \"Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,\" he says.",
      "The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land.",
      "Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed \"Big Sam\".",
      "He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. \"All\u00a0the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,\" he says. \"But\u00a0its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there.\"",
      "Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old.",
      "Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd \u2013 as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike.",
      "A sudden devastating event",
      "All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time?",
      "\"We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,\" Prof Bamforth says.",
      "All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders.",
      "Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. \"These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all.\"",
      "Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone.",
      "But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists.",
      "\"We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,\" says Prof Bamforth.",
      "\"That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things.\"",
      "As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.",

      "Mining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.",
      "He says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.",

      "\"Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa\u2026 It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,\" Mr Sefuli says.",
      "The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.",
      "Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.",

      "They launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.",
      "As part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, \"smoke out\" the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.",

    "summary": "Matthew Radalj tells the BBC of his time in a Beijing prison, revealing what goes on behind bars.",
    "story": [
      "Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison \u2013 a facility used for international inmates.",
      "Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture.",
      "The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was.",
      "Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on.",
      "The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "A harsh introduction",
      "\"I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,\" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020.",
      "The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen.",
      "He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration.",
      "Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.",
      "Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal \"transition phase\".",
      "During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions.",
      "\"We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.\"",
      "Eventually he was admitted to the \"normal\" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off.",
      "You also ate in the same room, he said.",
      "According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.",
      "The 'good behaviour' points system",
      "Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.",
      "One of these was the \"good behaviour points system\" which was a way \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 to reduce your sentence.",
      "Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time.",
      "If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work.",
      "Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation.",
      "He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.",
      "These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking \"incorrectly\" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.",
      "Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits.",
      "Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions.",
      "\"There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,\" he said. \"If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell.",
      "\"There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.\"",
      "One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence.",
      "Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system.",
      "So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure.",
      "These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.",
      "Food As Control",
      "But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food.",
      "The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat.",
      "They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added.",
      "Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition \u2013 and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week \u2013 that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou.",
      "Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their \"accounts\": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste.",
      "They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this \"privilege\" could be taken away.",
      "Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "To make things worse, they were made to work on a \"farm\", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them.",
      "Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was.",
      "But, he said, it was all for show.",
      "\"We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then \u2013 at the end of the season \u2013 they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,\" he added.",
      "\"And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.\"",
      "Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison.",
      "Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: \"The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.\"",
      "Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue.",
      "The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and \"were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas\", he said.",
      "Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items.",
      "This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner.",
      "Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem.",
      "His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year.",
      "\"You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do\u2026 So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big.",
      "\"After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.\"",
      "Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: \"It's none of your business.\"",
      "'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
      "Aboard the 'silver trains', China's retirees do their bit to offset Trump's tariffs",
      "The small-town mayor accused of trafficking and spying for China",
      "Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake \"propaganda\" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there.",
      "He said, at one point, a \"computer suite\" was set up. \"They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.\"",
      "The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just \"pretend\".",
      "\"Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,\" Radalj said.",
      "But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.",
      "The memoirs",
      "Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released.",
      "\"I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller\u2026 smaller!'.\"",
      "Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail.",
      "Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked.",
      "So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families.",
      "\"I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.\"",
      "He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing.",
      "But he couldn't keep it down.",
      "The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, \"Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?\"",
      "So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead.",
      "When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest.",
      "There was a tear in the lining of his jacket and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him.",
      "Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left.",
      "\"Did you forget something?\" the guards asked.",
      "\"They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.\"",
      "But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside.",
      "\"They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.\"",
      "The notes were still there.",
      "Life After Prison",
      "Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates.",
      "\"He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'\".",
      "The officer laughed.",
      "He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing.",
      "Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products.",
      "Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly.",
      "But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends \u2013 \"I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.\"",
      "Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life.",
      "\"With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,\" Radalj says. \"You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison.\""

    "published": "Sun, 18 May 2025 00:08:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC visits families in Kashmir devastated by the deadliest clashes in years, and speaks to military insiders.",
    "story": [
      "Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.",
      "When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. \"My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before.\" Again they ran. \"I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out.\" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.",
      "A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.",
      "\"When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,\" said MN Sudhan, 72. \"Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.\"",
      "\"Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,\" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. \"Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.\"",
      "Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.",
      "The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.",
      "What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.",
      "Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.",
      "In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.",
      "\"The strikes\u2026 were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,\" an Indian government source told the BBC. \"We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.\"",
      "But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.",
      "\"We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,\" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.",
      "Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.",
      "\"We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,\" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.",
      "But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. \"Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.\"",
      "It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.",
      "A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.",
      "India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.",
      "But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.",
      "\"I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,\" Hafeeza said.",
      "Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.",
      "\"A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood\u2026 We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.",
      "Sanam, who lost her mother, said: \"I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.\"",
      "Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.",
      "\"The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.\"",
      "After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a \"clear sense in\u2026 power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.",
      "\"We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.\"",
      "On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.",
      "US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be \"none of our business\".",
      "This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, \"it was clear the US didn't want to get involved\".",
      "By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.",
      "Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.",
      "The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.",
      "\"I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.",
      "\"That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.\"",
      "One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.",
      "\"There were six or seven of us packed into it,\" she said. \"The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,\" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.",
      "Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.",
      "Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.",
      "He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.",
      "\"Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.",
      "\"A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.\"",
      "Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.",
      "\"We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.\"",
      "As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.",
      "India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.",
      "\"This was a red line crossed,\" said one Pakistani officer. \"The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it\u2026 For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.\"",
      "Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.",
      "\"It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.\"",
      "On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the \"cross-border terrorist attack\" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.",
      "Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.",
      "\"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.",
      "\"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.",
      "India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.",
      "Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.",
      "\"We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,\" the Indian government source believes.",
      "In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.",
      "Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.",
      "A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.",
      "His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants \"exemplary punishment\" for the killers.",
      "\"This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,\" he said.",
      "A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.",
      "\"The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town\u2026 Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.\"",
      "The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.",
      "The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.",
      "\"Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.\"",

      "\"If you were in their shoes, you'd kind of go, 'Yeah, exactly. Well, actually, you know what? He's got a point,'\" Czerny said. \"I don't like him because he reminds me of parts of me that I don't particularly like. But maybe he's got a point.\"",
      "Czerny first portrayed Kittridge as the former head of the Impossible Mission Force in the original 1996 film, often serving as an antagonist to Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. After a 25-year absence from the franchise, he returned for the last two installments.",
      "\"They ask you to come back and we're going to have another look at that character after he's been through a whole bunch of stuff. What do you say? It's brilliant,\" he said.",

      "\"You read it, you imagine what this person has gone through, you dig into everything that you have that might relate to something that they've done in their life,\" Czerny explained about his preparation process. \"You put all the other stuff away, and somebody calls action and you get the hell out of the way and see what happens.\"",
      "Working with director Christopher McQuarrie and Cruise has evolved Czerny's approach to acting over the decades.",

      "Czerny praised the franchise's recent iterations for giving even antagonist characters depth and dimension rather than making them simple villains.",

      "The British actress, who plays Grace in the latest installment hitting theaters Friday, underwent extensive training to work with sled dogs on the frozen sea. The extreme conditions were real, no green screen effects.",
      "\"We had to train to know what it was like, how to survive, how to work out there,\" she said.",
      "Atwell's character represents a departure from typical action film roles for women. Rather than serving as a romantic interest, Grace develops what Atwell calls a \"nuanced intimacy\" with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.",
      "\"The woman is not just the object of desire or not led with a romantic agenda,\" Atwell said, \"There's intellectual stimulation between them, common cause that brings them together, something that feels sibling-like, maternal.\"",
      "Working alongside Cruise for five years has given Atwell insight into the actor's off-camera persona. The two have become close, he even took her grandmother on a helicopter ride at sunset on Christmas Eve.",
      "\"For a man who is an aerobatic pilot, seeing him be so gentle and kind and patient with her and explaining how everything worked, that to me was like just a mark of a really decent guy,\" she said.",
      "To prepare for her role as a thief, Atwell practiced sleight-of-hand techniques, even successfully stealing items from Cruise during filming, including salt and pepper shakers, a watch, a necklace and gym socks.",
      "\"I've never been a thief before. So I needed to practice,\" she said.",
      "Atwell describes \"The Final Reckoning\" as \"the culmination of all the movies that's gone before\" that \"ties up plot points and characters that people have been watching for the last 30 years.\" The film received a five-minute standing ovation at its debut in France.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial continues Monday in New York City. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura\u00a0wrapped up her testimony Friday after four days on the stand.",
      "The hip-hop mogul is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that manipulated women into participating in commercial sex acts with him, and sometimes male sex workers, during what prosecutors described as drug-fueled parties called \"freak offs.\"",
      "Combs has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn since his arrest last September. He\u00a0faces five counts from four different women, including Ventura.",
      "So far, jurors heard from a former security manager at the Los Angeles hotel where Combs was seen on a now infamous video attacking Ventura in 2016, along with a man who says he was hired to have sex with Ventura while Combs watched, and Ventura herself.",
      "On Friday, they also heard from a special agent who photographed the hotel where Combs was arrested last year, and from Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard, who testified about seeing Combs assault Ventura.",
      "Here's what to know about the charges and key names in the case.",
      "Who is Cassie Ventura? Hotel video a key piece of evidence",
      "Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, rose to fame with the single \"Me & U\" on her self-titled debut album. The song landed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in 2006.",
      "In her testimony, she said she signed with Bad Boy Records when she was 19, and Combs first kissed her on her 21st birthday. She and Combs dated off-and-on for more than 10 years, from about 2007 to 2018.",
      "She said she recorded hundreds of songs as part of a 10-album deal, but most were never released. She testified Combs became controlling and violent, and the \"freak offs\" became her job.",
      "Ventura spoke about years of alleged psychological and physical abuse. She also said Wednesday that he raped her after they had broken up in 2018.",
      "\"This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing for me,\" Ventura said in a statement after her testimony. \"I hope that my testimony has given strength and a voice to other survivors, and can help others who have suffered to speak up and also heal from abuse and fear.\"",
      "The security video of Combs attacking Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental hotel is a key piece of evidence in his trial. The video,\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0by CNN last year, shows Combs throw her onto the floor before kicking and dragging her.",
      "Prosecutors allege the hotel assault happened during a \"freak off,\" but Combs' lawyers, who\u00a0sought to have the video excluded from trial, argue it was a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship.\"",
      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",
      "Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers, who described the women as \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",
      "Combs' defense team is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending\u00a0Luigi Mangione\u00a0in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Also on the seven-person defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that lasted nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Can you watch the Diddy trial live?",
      "Per federal court rules, photos and videos from inside court are not allowed. Courtroom sketches, however, are permitted.",

      "Ventura is a critical witness in the prosecution's case against Combs, who has been accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and exploiting women for decades until his\u00a0arrest\u00a0on multiple charges last September. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The music mogul could receive a lifetime prison sentence if convicted on all of them.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from Ventrua's testimony.",
      "Violence occurred \"frequently\"",
      "In her initial statements before the court, Ventura, now pregnant with her third child and married to personal trainer Alex Fine, recalled her and Combs' early interactions and how she started to see a different side of him over time. She said she met Combs when she was a newly signed singer at 19, and their burgeoning friendship became romantic two years later.",
      "She also described his alleged violence throughout their 10-year on-off relationship, recounting instances where he knocked her over, kicked and dragged her, and stomped on her head, causing black eyes and bruises on her body. When asked, Ventura said the abuse she endured happened \"frequently.\"",
      "Combs is seen attacking Ventura in video footage CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0last year, which shows him throwing her to the floor, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.",
      "\"Control was everything\"",
      "Ventura characterized Combs as physically and psychologically abusive throughout the first hours of her testimony.",
      "\"Control was everything \u2014 from the way that I looked, to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,\" she said. \"Control was an all-around thing to a certain point.\"",
      "Combs allegedly introduced Ventura to \"freak offs,\" drug-fueled events where he is accused of forcing women to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, which were a focus of the indictment outlining his alleged crimes.",
      "Ventura said Combs broached the idea of sexual encounters involving voyeurism during the first year of their relationship, and he would hire an escort or dancer with whom he would watch her engage while he directed them. The singer testified she felt confused and nervous, \"but I also loved him very much and wanted to make him happy.\"",
      "She testified she worried about making Combs angry because of how much control he had over her life and career, and the possibility that he could blackmail her by releasing images of the \"freak offs.\" Prosecutors alleged in court documents that Combs often recorded these performances with or without participants' consent.",
      "A shift in the relationship",
      "Ventura recalled Combs looking out for her when she first met him. They fell in love, she said, while spending time together in the studio or traveling elsewhere.",
      "\"I think I was just enamored by him. We were just having a good time. It was really fun at this point,\" she told the court. But as her appearance, transportation, rent and overall lifestyle came under Combs' control, Ventura said her music career \u2014 and record deal \u2014 eventually took a backseat to the alleged \"freak offs,\" which left her feeling humiliated.",
      "She testified that despite recording hundreds of songs and nine albums while she was with Combs, the work was never released because \"freak offs\" became her job. They took up too much time and energy to leave room for other pursuits, Ventura said, adding that she would stay up for several days at a time to party, drink and have sex with strangers.",
      "The \"freak offs\" could last from 36 to 72 hours at a time, she said, with the longest continuing for four days. She recalled them happening almost weekly for years.",
      "Ventura felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by \"freak offs\"",
      "Ventura began to cry during her testimony when asked whether she wanted to participate in every \"freak off.\" She said she didn't and that she felt \"disgusted\" and \"humiliated\" by them, but she also didn't want to disappoint Combs.",
      "Ventura told the court Combs dismissed her when she expressed how she felt about them, calling her predictable for not wanting to engage.",
      "Testifying at length about the \"freak offs,\" Ventura said Combs provided ecstasy and cocaine, which she took to stay awake during the incidents.",
      "2016 hotel incident",
      "Ventura recalled the 2016 hotel altercation seen on video footage. After being shown a clip from the incident during the second day of her testimony, she recounted that Combs was yelling and threw something at her during the attack.",
      "She said she told Combs via text message she had a black eye from the incident and reminded him of a premiere she was supposed to attend.",
      "\"You are sick for thinking it's OK to do what you've done,\" she wrote in a text to Combs. \"Please stay far away from me.\"",
      "Ventura told the court she wore sunglasses to cover her eyes and used makeup to hide bruises on other parts of her body when she attended the premiere.",
      "Prosecutors showed several photos of Ventura at the premiere event and after party, where the injuries could be seen.",
      "Drug use",
      "Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his \"freak offs,\" Ventura said. She also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects.",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs' \"freak offs\" involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and accuse him of using substances in part to exercise control over the people he targeted.",
      "She said Combs didn't like the drug and argued a successful \"freak off\" can be remembered, but explained ketamine was her preference because it allowed her to be less present in the moment.",
      "Rape allegation",
      "Ventura told the jury that Combs raped her in her living room in 2018. They were not together at the time and Ventura was seeing the man who is now her husband, she testified. Ventura said she remembered crying and saying no, but Combs did not stop. After, he got up and left, Ventura testified.",

      "Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them \"treasonous\" and \"incompetent\" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week.

      "Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" tour.",
      "\"The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,\" he said. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to \"raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!\"",
      "Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and \"taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.\"",
      "\"They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,\" Springsteen said. \"They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\"",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is \"just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"",

Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor.",

      "Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas.",

      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",
      "The NIH's acquisitions office was also gutted by those layoffs, according to an email to lab managers shared with CBS News, leaving the agency's supply center with \"little to no capacity for new work\" to obtain supplies for researchers.",

      "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in 'magic mushrooms.' When administered in controlled, clinical research settings, it has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety, both of which are mood symptoms associated with Parkinson's that are linked to a faster physical decline.",
      "\"The neurodegeneration that is happening isn't just impacting motor circuitry \u2013 it's impacting a lot of brain circuitry. That creates this huge burden of symptoms that we often overlook and don't talk about enough, maybe,\" said Dr. Ellen Bradley, of UCSF. \"We were really surprised by how well this trial went.\"",

      "\"We had folks do a lower dose of Psilocybin \u2013 a 10 mg dose initially \u2013 and monitored them for a couple of weeks to see how that went,\" Bradley said. \"If it did go well, if we didn't have safety concerns, then they were eligible for the full therapeutic dose of 25 mg.\"",

      "\"We want to find out not just does Psilocybin therapy work, but if it does, how does it work? That mechanistic piece is so important,\" she said. \"Can it change the brain's ability to adapt to its environment and to rewire itself?\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is now seeking to implement the idea through an executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Democrats and the Biden administration dropped plans to set drug price caps based on the amount paid in other high-income countries, during talks years ago to push through the law that empowered Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription medications.",
      "A version of the idea was revived by President Trump in the executive order signed Monday, which called on the Department of Health and Human Services next month to draw up regulations to impose price restrictions tied to lower amounts paid in other developed nations, if drugmakers did not voluntarily reduce what they were charging in the U.S.",
      "\"Democrats could have done this a long time ago. They have fought like hell, for the drug companies. And they knew they were doing the wrong thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, speaking at a White House event to announce the move.",
      "For Democrats on Capitol Hill, this kind of approach to price controls has roots in a bill their own party successfully passed under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.",
      "As part of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate the price of costly drugs it covered, the bill passed by House Democrats wanted the maximum price to be tied to an average based on prices paid in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.",
      "\"We were hoping to get Trump. Trump said, 'I want to negotiate.' But then Republicans in Congress got to him,\" said Wendell Primus, who served for nearly two decades as Pelosi's top aide on health policy.",
      "The bill did not make it through the Senate at the time, which was controlled by Mr. Trump's party. After Democrats flipped control of the Senate, the idea ran into headwinds years later, as Biden aides and lawmakers tried to incorporate the measure into the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Multiple Democrats involved in the talks on Capitol Hill at the time blamed a series of meetings in early 2021 with the staff from the Senate Finance Committee and party leadership for scuttling the idea.",
      "Staff on the committee said that they were worried that moderate Democrats like then-Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would not support the bill if it included the measure, Primus said. Menendez and Sinema are no longer in the Senate.",
      "\"Members did not want to have something referencing foreign countries. They wanted it to make a function of the manufacturer's price here, what drug companies were offering to commercial insurers,\" Primus said.",
      "One former Biden White House aide involved in the talks said that there were several senators who understood that drug prices were too high, but they worried those price caps could undercut innovation from drugmakers in the U.S.",
      "Instead, the deal struck by lawmakers and White House aides to pass the law in 2022 ultimately turned to a different formula: capping them using calculations based on the price previously paid by Medicare and a fixed discount off the list price in the private U.S. market.",
      "\"President Biden and Democrats in Congress cared about getting something done, and so there was a compromise on the table that wasn't perfect, but it was going to make a huge amount of difference. And so that's the law they ultimately enacted,\" said Christen Linke-Young, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Mr. Biden.",
      "Medicare has gone on to implement the law, resulting in talks that are continuing under the current Trump administration to lower the maximum price that the federal insurance program will pay for a growing list of costly drugs.",
      "\"It's a good thing for prescription drug costs in this country to be lower, we need to continue to work on that. And one of the ways to do that is actually put a proposal before Congress and get it enacted, so it has the force of law,\" said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, as the White House was working with their allies in Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration moved to formally scrap a bid by Mr. Trump to impose caps tied to lower prices in other high-income countries using executive power during his first term.",
      "Called the \"most favored nation\" model, Trump officials had directed Medicare to only reimburse hospitals and clinics for some costly drugs based on the lowest price paid for in other high-income countries.",
      "CMS under Mr. Biden ultimately rescinded that move in 2022, after a legal fight that had blocked the proposal on the grounds that the Trump administration had unlawfully shortcutted the normal rulemaking steps to finalize the policy.",
      "\"The proposal was always pretty transparently illegal. The statute says that Medicare has to pay for prescription drugs in one particular way, and the Trump administration proposal was that we are going to ignore the statute and pay for drugs in an entirely different way. If the statute allowed that, a president before Donald Trump would have done it,\" Linke-Young said.",
      "A White House official under Mr. Trump disagreed with the accusation that their initial proposal was unlawful, arguing that the initial authority they used for the \"demonstration\" model in Medicare used powers that were broadly written by Democrats.",
      "While they are not planning to go down the exact same path, the official said, saying that they \"learned certain things from that first demonstration,\" the Trump administration believes they \"absolutely have that authority in our pocket.\"",
      "\"We are confident that we have authorities within our government programs to do this. And any dispute from the Biden administration is an intentional misinterpretation of the statute for political reasons, because they are the ones that walked away,\" the White House official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have painted their second run at the \"most favored nation\" idea as even broader in scope than their first term, which had been limited to only some costly drugs administered by healthcare providers through Medicare Part B.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday that they \"firmly believe\" they have the ability to pursue wider actions to push drugmakers to lower their prices within Medicare. They cited other authorities in the law being considered like section 402, which affords HHS powers to \"develop and engage in experiments\" which could affect payment rates in Medicaid as well.",
      "Asked this week on Fox Business Network whether the president's promise of steep drug price cuts would also extend to Medicare Part D, which covers the broad swath of prescriptions filled at drug store pharmacies, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said \"they absolutely will.\"",
      "\"They'll apply to Medicare, and they'll apply in the private market as well,\" Kennedy said.",

      "The reinstatements mean that some NIOSH programs might soon be able to resume, after they were previously hobbled by the layoffs.",

      "In NIOSH's Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, laid-off scientists and engineers were called back to work, but only for a few more weeks to wind down their laboratories and research before their layoff notices take effect. Those NIOSH employees have not received letters formally rescinding their layoffs, unlike some of their colleagues.",
      "Part of their work includes overseeing miner safety programs like the personal dust monitors, or PDM, required by the Department of Labor for coal miners. NIOSH is responsible for testing PDM's accuracy. The monitors are needed to reduce the risk of black lung disease.",

An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 27% from 110,000 in 2023.",
      "Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \"underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress.\"",
      "Some experts worry the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.",
      "\"Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,\" said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "All but two states saw declines last year \u2014 with some of the biggest in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation's decades-long overdose epidemic.

      "The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it's clear that there was a huge drop last year.",
      "A CDC report late last year showed that overdose deaths in the U.S. fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 credited in part to wider naloxone access. Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan,  was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase\u00a0in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders\u00a0to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts have previously said could reverse progress the U.S. has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.",
      "But there are reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.",
      "Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.",
      "The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.",
      "But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \"States can either say, 'We won, we can walk away'\" in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 06:48:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

      "Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by \"increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.''",

If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 05:00:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

      "Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained near their 25-year peak because they tend to track the 10-year Treasury bond, which is sensitive to economic conditions. With Moody's downgrade on Friday, the markets slipped in early trading and the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped above 5%, the highest since late 2023.",
      "Stock and bond prices trimmed their losses as the day progressed, with the S&P 500 reversing from a loss of 1.1% to a modest gain of 0.2%.",
      "Because the nation's debt issues are so well known already, investors have likely already accounted for them, according to Brian Rehling, head of global fixed income strategy and other analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 15:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data\u00a0 Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "Airbnb said that it would appeal the decision. Through a spokesperson, the company said it did not think the ministry was authorized to rule on short-term rentals \u2014 and that it had utilized \"an indiscriminate methodology\" to include Airbnb rentals that do not need a license to operate.",

      "23andMe moved in November to slash 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan, a step that came roughly two months after its entire board resigned.",
      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",
      "23andMe offers two basic kinds of services \u2014 consumer and therapeutics. The former provides people with information on their ancestry and genetic health profile, including the risk of passing on certain conditions to their children, according to S&P Capital IQ. The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-social-services-housing-nutrition/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",

      "The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering \"PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.\" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder.",
      "If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost \u2014 their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found.",

The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution,\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%.",
      "The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful, bill,\" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending.",
      "Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program.",
      "Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies.",

The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said.",

The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6%",

      "Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan\u00a0Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts.",
      "If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices.",
      "\"If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,\" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post.",
      "Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps.",
      "On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration.",
      "Extending the 2017 tax cuts",
      "As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up\u00a0work requirements\u00a0for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029.",
      "Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's\u00a0federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000.",
      "But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 17:37:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, according to an investigation led by Consumer Reports and others.",
    "story": [
      "Kroger shoppers might be paying more at checkout than they bargained for.",
      "A new investigation\u00a0found price tag errors at the supermarket giant's stores leading to customers being overcharged on many items marked as discounted or on sale. Expired discount tags were found on everyday products ranging from Cheerios cereal to Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffee, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian and the Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN).",
      "The probe stems from allegations made by Kroger employees in Colorado who are currently in labor negotiations with the supermarket chain.",
      "\"People should pay the price that is being advertised, that's the law,\" Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, who runs the Consumer World website, told Consumer Reports. \"The issue here is that shoppers can't rely on the shelf price being accurate, and that's a big problem.\"",
      "Kroger operates roughly 2,700 stores throughout the U.S., according to the company's\u00a0website, and owns a suite of supermarkets that includes Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Fry's and Ralphs.",
      "To conduct the investigation, Consumer Reports, The Guardian and FERN recruited people to shop at more than two dozen Kroger and Kroger-owned stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia over a roughly three-month period this year.",
      "The investigation found that expired sales labels led to overcharges on more than 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. For instance, a bag of Mission Flour Tortillas at a Harris Teeter in Alexandria, Virginia, was advertised as on sale for $2.99, while customers were charged $4.99.",
      "Although pricing mistakes were not found at all the Kroger stores in the investigation, the probe found issues at over half of the 26 locations it examined.",
      "Kroger took issue with the findings, saying the investigation greatly overstates the pricing issues.",
      "The \"characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,\" a Kroger spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, adding that the errors cited by the investigators represented only a \"few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually.\"",
      "Although Consumer Price Index\u00a0data shows\u00a0the rate of inflation and grocery prices eased last month, Americans continue to face higher\u00a0costs for household goods.",
      "\"Even if the incidents are careless rather than calculated, it creates a perception that Kroger is ripping people off,\" said Neil Saunders, an analyst with retail industry research firm GlobalData in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not what any grocery retailer wants or needs when the consumer is looking to maximize value for money.\"",
      "Kroger not alone in overcharging claims",
      "The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger: Retailers like Walmart, Safeway, Albertsons and Vons have\u00a0been hit with similar allegations.",
      "Grocery giant Albertsons in October agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the California chain of selling items for more than their lowest advertised price.",
      "But the Kroger case stand out for several reasons said Derek Kravitz, an investigative journalist and author of the Consumer Reports story. One is that in states in the Midwest and the South, where the retailer has a strong foothold, Kroger is often one of just a few places to choose from for grocery shopping.",
      "Kravitz also pointed to the persistent flow of complaints from Kroger customers over out-of-date sales prices, dating back to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, for example, the attorney general's office has received nearly 60 complaints of price tag and overcharge issues at Kroger since 2021.",
      "\"Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,\" Belpre resident Allison Hadfield noted in one of three complaints she and her husband, Derek, filed against their local Kroger store, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "Shopper Elizabeth Giovanni also submitted several complaints to her local Kroger store in Millington, Tennessee. In one case, she said an entire dairy case with cheese had expired signs.",
      "\"I've recently stopped shopping there because of their lack of accountability and willingness to change the prices when they're in the wrong,\" she said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to individual complaints, customers have also filed multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, with cases ongoing in California, Ohio and Illinois, according to The Guardian.",
      "Kroger said it has taken steps to fix price discrepancies. That includes instituting a policy that gives employees the authority to fix price problems on the spot.",
      "\"Kroger is committed to affordable and accurate pricing, and we conduct robust price check processes that reviews millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate,\" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Potential staffing issues",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the average number of employees at the Kroger-owned stores that the researchers focused on fell by 10.3%, or 17 employees per store, according to the report, which cites data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The average number of hours worked also fell by 2.7 hours per week.",
      "\"There are simply not enough employees to manually switch out price labels on shelves because some stores have tens of thousands of price tags hanging at any one time,\" Kravitz wrote in the report.",
      "Kroger denies there is a problem with understaffing. In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Kroger spokesperson said work hours and staffing at its stores have not been reduced.",
      "\"We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.\"",
      "The investigation on overcharging comes as the grocery giant reports record sales and profits. Kroger reported $3.8 billion in operating profit last year, according to a March earnings\u00a0report.",

      "Revered in the South for his efforts to defend the country against Japanese encroachment, Ahn Jung-geun is best known for his dramatic, high-stakes assassination of Japan's first prime minister, Ito Hirobumi, in 1909 at a train station in Harbin. Ahn shouted \"Hurrah for Korea!\" as he was arrested, according to the Association for Asian Studies based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
      "He was hanged for the killing by Japanese authorities in 1910, just months before Tokyo formally annexed the Korean Peninsula, ushering in a brutal period of occupation that lasted until the end of World War II.",
      "Now, more than a century after his death, the calligraphy Ahn created in his prison cell during his final days \u2014 typically at the request of Japanese officials \u2014 is drawing fresh attention in Seoul's glitzy art scene.",
      "In South Korea, Ahn's life has long inspired artists across generations, giving rise to a highly celebrated musical, multiple novels, and films \u2014 including one starring \"Crash Landing on You\" actor Hyun Bin.",
      "Ahn was held in his prison cell in China for about 40 days leading up to his execution and he kept himself busy writing an autobiography and making hundreds of calligraphy pieces, including one requested by his own prison guard.",
      "\"The court and prison officials, saying they wanted to keep my calligraphy as a memento, brought me hundreds of sheets of silk and paper and asked me to create for them,\" Ahn wrote in his autobiography. \"I ended up spending several hours each day doing calligraphy, even though I wasn't particularly skilled in it.\"",
      "Even though Ahn had assassinated their top official Ito, the Japanese who took his calligraphy preserved them with care, and some of their descendants have donated them to the South Korean government, which subsequently designated them as national treasures.",
      "Now, more of the calligraphies are surfacing in the private art market, with the latest being auctioned last month in Seoul for 940 million won ($674,098) \u2014 more than three times its opening bid.",
      "The piece, which says \"green bamboo\" \u2014 a traditional symbol of integrity \u2014 had been owned by a Japanese individual who did not wish to be identified, and they had done an impeccable job preserving it, said Kim Jun-seon, art valuation specialist at Seoul Auction.",

      "Moves to honor Ahn by Seoul and Beijing have previously strained ties with Tokyo, even briefly sparking a diplomatic row in 2013.",
      "In 2014, Japan criticized a memorial built in China to commemorate Ahn, BBC News reported. A Japanese government spokesman branded him a terrorist after the Chinese-Korean memorial hall opened in China's Harbin city, where Ito was shot.",
      "The fact that his Japanese captors preserved his calligraphy \"reflects the cultural and political contradictions of early 20th century East Asia,\" said Eugene Y. Park, a history professor at University of Nevada, Reno.",
      "At his trial, Ahn identified himself as a soldier for Korea, defined his assassination of Ito as a military operation, and envisioned a united East Asia \u2014 comprising Korea, China and Japan \u2014 somewhat akin to today's European Union.",
      "\"Some Japanese may have seen him as a misguided but principled idealist,\" Park told AFP.",
      "His calligraphy, which focused on values such as peace and ethics, \"resonated culturally, even if he opposed them politically,\" he said.",
      "\"At a time when Japan's own imperial identity was unsettled, preserving his works revealed deeper tensions between respect for moral courage and the pursuit of colonial domination.\"",
      "In 2023, the Global Sae-A Group, a South Korean conglomerate, purchased one of Ahn's calligraphies for a record-breaking 1.95 billion won (nearly $1.4 million).",

    "story": [
      "The House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda contains a provision that has prompted opposition from the Mexican government \u2014 a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries.",
      "The payments, known as remittances, would be subject to a 5% excise tax that would encompass more than 40 million people, including green card holders and nonimmigrant visa holders, such as people on H-1B, H-2A and H-2B visas. U.S. citizens would be exempt.",
      "In a May 13 letter to the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., urged Chairman Jason Smith and Ranking Member Richard Neal to reconsider the proposal.",
      "\"We respectfully urge you to reconsider this section of the legislative proposal, and we remain available to continue dialogue on the matter,\" wrote Barrag\u00e1n and Robert Velasco Alvarez, Mexico's chief officer for North America.",
      "Spokespeople for both Smith and Neal did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, President Trump hinted at a crackdown on remittances, announcing in a Truth Social Post\u00a0that the administration was \"finalizing a presidential memorandum to shut down remittances sent by illegal aliens outside of the United States.\" But details on the presidential proposal were unclear.",
      "The remittance tax provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also criticized the plan and urged Republican lawmakers to reconsider it.",
      "At a press briefing this week, Sheinbaum warned that the proposal \"would damage the economy of both nations and is also contrary to the spirit of economic freedom that the U.S. government claims to defend.\"",
      "\"Remittances are the fruit of the efforts of those who, through their honest work, strengthen not only the Mexican economy but also the United States', which is why we consider this measure to be arbitrary and unjust,\" she said.",
      "An estimate by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, which is cited in the letter, found that Mexican migrant workers sent on average 16.7% of their labor income as remittances.",
      "\"In other words, more than 80% of the income generated by this community remains in the U.S. economy,\" the letter says.",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, however, that the proposal would generate a little more than $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2026, and rise to about $3 billion by 2034.",
      "In the letter to lawmakers, Barrag\u00e1n said the proposal would amount to double taxation, \"since migrants already pay taxes in the country where they work.\"",
      "\"Imposing a tax on these transfers would disproportionately affect those with the least, without accounting for their ability to pay,\" he added and also warned of other unintended consequences.",
      "\"Many migrants might seek informal or unregulated means to do so, complicating oversight and control of these financial flows. This would not only reduce the expected revenue but also increase risks related to financial security, tax evasion and money laundering,\" he wrote.",
      "Barrag\u00e1n has been meeting with lawmakers in recent days and discussing the matter with them. On Tuesday, he hosted a dinner for members of Congress, including Texas Rep. Tony Gonzalez, whose district spans the length of much of the state's border with Mexico and is home to many migrant workers. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and Florida Rep Maria Elvira Salazar attended the dinner.",

      "Separately, Barragan met with Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick and also discussed the remittance measure.",

    "summary": "High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.",
    "story": [
      "High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool.",
      "Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs\u00a0could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found.",
      "\"We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,\" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling.",
      "\"It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,\" Wolfe said. \"And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity.\"",
      "Unpaid bills",
      "Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA.",
      "Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024.",
      "If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe.",
      "\"Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,\" Wolfe explained. \"And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer.\"",
      "Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. \"While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Extreme heat and health",
      "Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. \"We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,\" he said.",
      "This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments.",
      "Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 10:32:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The bottom 60% of U.S. households don't make enough money to afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to bring in to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, according to a new report.",
      "The analysis, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), looks beyond whether people can afford daily necessities like food and shelter to consider whether they have the means to pay for things like the technology tools necessary for their jobs, higher education, and health and child care.",
      "LISEP tracks costs associated with what the research firm calls a \"basket of American dream essentials.\" The group says its Minimal Quality of Life index provides a truer picture of how Americans are faring than standard economic data, such as the nation's gross domestic product and jobless rate. The index captures the annual change in the typical costs facing low- and moderate-income households who are looking to maintain a basic quality of life.",
      "\"We analyze these components not just in terms of financial figures but as crucial elements that shape a family's capability to achieve a desirable standard of living,\" the group explains in a paper describing its approach.",
      "The findings? For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a \"minimal quality of life\" is out of reach, according to the group, a research organization focused on improving lower earners' economic well-being.",
      "\"The middle class has been declining \u2014 we just haven't recognized it fully,\" LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's really dangerous because it's the kind of thing that leads to social unrest, and it's not fair. The American dream is not that it's given to you \u2014 it's that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead and achieve the things in life that you want to achieve. It's not living in a tent, not having to steal.\"",
      "The Ludwig Institute also says that the nation's official\u00a0unemployment rate of 4.2%\u00a0greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S. Factoring in workers who are stuck in poverty-wage jobs and people who are unable to find full-time employment, the U.S. jobless rate now tops 24%, according to LISEP, which defines these groups as \"functionally unemployed.\"",
      "Peering beneath the surface",
      "By those standards, the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living, according to LISEP. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "\"Traditional headline economic indicators like GDP and unemployment tell us the economy is thriving, but they don't reflect the lived reality of most Americans,\" Ludwig said in a statement. \"Americans are working harder than ever, fueling our economic growth, but the benefits of that hard work are not being distributed in a way that supports upward mobility for too many middle- and low-income Americans.\"",
      "From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis. Housing and health care costs surged, while the amount of savings required to attend an in-state, public university soared 122%.",
      "Meanwhile, median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4% over that span when adjusting for the cost of goods tracked by the group's index, according to LISEP. Income growth for these households has also lagged, rising 0.37% per year during the same period \u2014 less than half as much as for the top 40% of earners, the group found.",
      "The gap between how much low-income families earn and how much they need to afford a minimum cost of living is expected to keep widening, Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it is growing because the items that go into the basket of goods and services that make the minimal quality of life are inflating at a higher rate than wages are inflating,\" he said.",

      "\"We expect the U.S.'s effective tariff rate to increase by about 13 [percentage points] this year to its highest level since the 1930s,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a May 14 research note. \"While the ultimate level and composition of tariffs remains uncertain, they will probably remain elevated for the foreseeable future.\"",

While Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would ease tariffs on Chinese imports for 90 days \u2014 taking the rate down from 145% to about 30% \u2014 it represents an increased business expense for American companies.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first-quarter earnings call yesterday. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's rolling out the tariffs for a variety of reasons, including to spur domestic and foreign businesses to shift their manufacturing plants to the U.S. and revive American manufacturing jobs. On Friday, Mr. Trump touted announcements from some companies that have said they plan to invest in the U.S.",
      "\"[W]e're probably in the $12 to $13 trillion range of investments,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think we're heading toward the $12 to $13 trillion between projects already announced, mostly announced, but some are going to be announced very shortly and literally, very shortly.\"",
      "Still, many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spark a major revival in U.S. manufacturing.

      "The go-to store for brides on a budget has launched a higher-end, bricks-and-mortar chain called Diamonds & Pearls that offers dresses ranging from $700 to more than $5,000. David's expansion into the luxury segment comes two years after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inflation and pressures.",
      "The first Diamonds & Pearls store opened Thursday in Delray Beach, Florida. David's operates 193 stores across the U.S., selling gowns that range in cost from $500 to $3,000.",
      "While the company has long held a grip on the value-end of the bridal market, it was missing the luxury piece and wanted to serve customers looking for premium offerings, David's CEO Kelly Cook told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We found that 90% of all brides were in David's funnel, but we didn't have products to serve the couture bride, or the budget bride. We only had products to serve the middle,\" Cook said. \"Affordable luxury is the fastest-growing segment we have.\"",
      "Cook explained that brides are under pressure as tariffs weigh on the cost of weddings, which stands at $37,500 on average, she said. An\u00a0estimate from Fidelity pegs the average cost of a wedding in 2024 at $33,000.",
      "David's solved the budget consumer's end of the equation first. In March, it began selling wedding dresses for as little as $99, under the DB Studio label. And in December 2024, David's partnered with delivery service DoorDash to let customers order dresses on the app and have them delivered in minutes \u2014 along with dessert.",
      "Roughly 17% of David's brides are shopping for dresses for weddings that are within three weeks, \"So we have to serve the last-minute brides,\" Cook said.",

The company has plans to open at least one more Diamonds & Pearls store this year, Cook said.",
      "Cook's ultimate goal for the company is to serve every type of consumer \u2014 including grooms \u2014 along every step of the wedding planning process. That includes launching its own AI-powered wedding planning tools, video content and more.",
      "The company is now in a growth spurt, undeterred by President Trump's evolving tariff program\u00a0that is dissuading some companies from investing in growth. Mr. Trump had imposed tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, which now stand at 30% for a period of 90 days.",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 05:00:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate took a key procedural vote Monday evening on a first-of-its-kind crypto regulation bill after Democrats tanked it earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",
      "The measure fell short of the 60 votes necessary to move forward earlier this month, with all Senate Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 opposing. Paul has reservations about overregulation, while Hawley voted against the bill in part because it doesn't prohibit big tech companies from creating their own stablecoins.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who sponsored the legislation, defended the measure on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday. He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore. The Tennessee Republicans urged that \"this will fix it,\" while arguing that the bill has strong bipartisan support.",
      "\"We have broad policy agreement, Democrats and Republicans,\" Hagerty said. \"The question is can we get past the partisan politics and allow us to actually have a victory.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans plan to move ahead with a vote this week on the legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, which includes spending on tax cuts, as well as border security and defense priorities. Fractures in the GOP conference appeared to persist, despite the legislation's movement out of committee, throwing its passage into question. President Trump is expected to make a personal visit to House Republicans Tuesday to urge them to back the bill, a source familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "\"There's a lot more work to do,\" House Speaker Mike Johson told reporters late Sunday. \"But I'm looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions, over the next few days \u2014 and I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get this in final form and pass it.\"",
      "After the final three committees advanced their portions of the massive legislative package last week, a handful of conservative hardliners on the House Budget Committee blocked the package from moving forward Friday. The setback prompted work through the weekend to negotiate with the holdouts, who ultimately allowed the legislation to advance late Sunday.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington called it a \"critical step,\" while acknowledging that deliberations are continuing, with disagreements remaining on a cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and on when Medicaid work requirements would take effect. But Arrington said the vote to advance the legislation Sunday \"is a sign that people are confident that these things will be resolved.\"",
      "Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, two of the conservative holdouts, celebrated a change they said would be made to remove delays from the Medicaid work requirements, since conservatives opposed the original plan, which would have delayed until 2029 work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities. But Roy noted in a post on social media that \"the bill does not yet meet the moment,\" pointing to remaining sticking points on cutting clean energy subsidies implemented under the Biden administration and cuts to the federal share of payments for Medicaid.",
      "Johnson suggested that he and the conservatives had agreed to \"minor modifications\" over the weekend. The speaker is walking a tightrope between the hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates who are reluctant to slash Medicaid, while a number of Republicans who represent blue states have also threatened to withhold their votes unless their demands are met on SALT, among other divisions.",
      "On Monday, Johnson told reporters that there have been \"lots of discussions\" with the various members of different GOP caucuses, adding that nothing has been \"ultimately and finally decided\" as Republican leaders look to build consensus around the ideas.",
      "\"I told all the members on a conference call this morning that this is a consensus-building operation, it's been a bottom-up process,\" Johnson said. \"And we're almost there.\"",
      "The legislation is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday at 1 a.m., where any changes to the legislation would be made. But Roy and Norman also sit on the Rules Committee and could raise a final hurdle there ahead of the full House vote. Should the package advance out of the Rules Committee, it would tee up a vote on the package on Thursday, before lawmakers are set to leave town for the Memorial Day recess.",
      "As Republican leadership irons out the remaining issues, President Trump is expected to continue to pressure Republicans to get the bill passed this week, as he did on Friday on social media. And on Tuesday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation is expected to face some resistance in the Senate, where a number of Republicans have warned that should the House pass the bill, the upper chamber will try to make changes.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters late last week that the House bill \"would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it.\" And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"we've assumed all along that the Senate would have its input on this.\"",
      "Johnson said on Fox News Sunday that \"the package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\"",
      "Beyond the self-imposed deadlines, the inclusion of a debt limit increase in the package has added urgency to getting the legislation to the president's desk. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress earlier this month to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. And top administration and congressional leaders have circled July 4 as the deadline to get the package to the president desk.",
      "\"We've got to get this done and get it to the president's desk by that big celebration on Independence Day,\" Johnson said. \"I'm convinced that we can.\"",

      "Tricia McLaughlin, DHS's assistant secretary for public affairs, called the high court's ruling a \"win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "Congress in 1990 created the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation, set to last 18 months, in October 2023.",
      "In addition to designating Venezuela for TPS, the Biden administration also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Venezuelan program is the largest and covers roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations, though only the designation from 2023 is at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "After Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated the extension for more than 350,000 Venezuelans, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7. The Trump administration is also revoking TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians, with that move set to take effect in August.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision to end the protections for Venezuelans, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor, stopping Noem's termination determination from taking effect nationwide.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's order \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's injunction \"ill-considered.\"",
      "But in response to the request, lawyers for TPS beneficiaries told the Supreme Court in a filing that lifting the district court's injunction would harm the nearly 350,000 people who would immediately lose their right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "\"Staying the district court's order would cause far more harm than it would stop,\" they wrote. \"It would radically shift the status quo, stripping plaintiffs of their legal status and requiring them to return to a country the State Department still deems too dangerous even to visit.\"",
      "They said that the TPS statute does not grant the Homeland Security secretary authority to vacate or rescind an extension, and Noem's terminations of TPS extensions for Venezuela and Haiti were the first and second times that a secretary has set an extension aside in the statute's history.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of more than a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court, and one of several involving his immigration plans.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice sent\u00a0a letter\u00a0to Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's office Monday to inform him they've opened an investigation into the city's hiring practices.",
      "The letter, dated Monday, accuses the City of Chicago of violating Title VII of the\u00a0Civil Rights Act of 1964\u00a0in its hiring practices for state and local government employees.",
      "The letter says Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the investigation be opened based on information \"suggesting that you have made hiring decisions solely on the basis of race.\"",
      "The DOJ letter was a lightning-fast reaction to comments made by Mayor Johnson on Sunday at the Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn. The mayor talked at the church about the number of Black officials in his administration.",
      "This was the comment that set the investigation in motion:",
      "\"The deputy mayor is a Black woman. The Department of Planning and Development is a Black woman. Infrastructure deputy mayor is a Black woman. Chief operations officer is a Black man.\u00a0 Budget director is a Black woman. Senior advisor is a Black man. And I'm laying that out because when you ask, how do we ensure that our people get a chance to grow their business? Having people in my administration that will look out for the interest of everyone \u2014 and everyone means you have to look out for the interest of Black folks, because that hasn't happened.\"",
      "The Justice Department citing that exact moment in a letter to Mayor Johnson on Monday.",
      "\"Considering these remarks, I have authorized an investigation to determine whether the City of Chicago is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination as set forth above,\" wrote Harmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general with the DOJ Civil Rights Division. \"If these kind of hiring decisions are being made for top-level positions in your administration, then it begs the question whether such decisions are also being made for lower-level positions.\"",
      "Title VII of the Civil Rights act prevents employment discrimination, but there are major exceptions to it. These include hiring at churches, and political appointments \u2014 like Johnson's senior staff whom he listed Sunday.",
      "\"They would not be employees under Title VII, so even if it were true that he was going out of his way to hire people of a particular race, that would not violate the law,\" said Carolyn Shapiro of the Chicago-Kent College of Law.",
      "Shapiro said the DOJ assumption that since Johnson's senior staff is mostly Black, there is discrimination at play, is a leap.",
      "\"It's an enormous leap to say that because Brandon Johnson's top deputies and policymaking positions are African American, that the city is discriminating on the basis of race in its hiring of ordinary, non-policy making employees,\" said Shapiro.",
      "Mayor Johnson has previously been called to Capitol Hill by conservative legislators who are angry over Chicago's sanctuary city status. The mayor has also been a repeated target of the Trump White House, and has compared President Trump's policies to terrorists.",
      "Mayor Johnson's team released this statement late Monday:",
      "\"Mayor Johnson is proud to have the most diverse administration in the history of our city. Our administration reflects the diversity and values of Chicago. Unfortunately, the current federal administration does not reflect either. We are aware of the letter issued by the Department of Justice, but are awaiting the official receipt of the letter. Our Corporation Counsel will review it at that time.\"",

      "Mahdawi \u2014 who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia's campus in 2023 \u2014 was greeted by cheers and applause as he returned to accept his diploma, donning a blue graduation cap with the scales of justice depicted on the top. After the event, he periodically stopped to flash peace signs or take photos with other graduates.",
      "In an interview with CBS News shortly before the ceremony, Mahdawi said he felt a \"mix of emotions\" \u2014 including a \"feeling of being victorious.\"",
      "\"They didn't want me to graduate. They didn't want me to be educated. They didn't want me to be out of prison,\" Mahdawi said. \"And I am out because of the good people in this country and the democratic system.\"",

      "Mahdawi said he has \"conflicting feelings\" about his time at Columbia, citing the war in Gaza and the continued detention of fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil. He was also critical of Columbia's handling of his case, saying the school \"let me down\" by not offering him more protection. CBS News has reached out to Columbia for comment.",
      "Mahdawi added, \"I'm not going anywhere, and I'm going to continue my education here as well.\"",
      "He told CBS News after the ceremony he saw his classmates' reactions as a \"message of acknowledgement for the work that I have been doing, and an acknowledgement for what people desire. They want to see justice and peace in this country.\"",

A day beforehand, he told CBS News he feared the appointment was a \"honey trap.\" He remained in immigration custody for just over two weeks, until U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release earlier this month.",
      "Despite his release, Mahdawi's case remains active as a judge reviews the issue.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi under a law that allows the government to revoke visas if the secretary of state believes somebody's presence in the U.S. poses \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Mahdawi argues his detention violated the First Amendment by punishing him for protesting.",
      "The administration has also accused Mahdawi of \"threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders,\" which he has denied, telling CBS News last month, \"antisemitism has no place in our movement.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News a week after his release, Mahdawi called the government's argument for detaining him \"laughable\": \"A person who has been vocally advocating for justice and peace is undermining U.S. policy?\" he said.",
      "Mahdawi is one of several students to face detention after their involvement in pro-Palestinian activism, with the government often citing the \"foreign policy consequences\" law.",
      "Another Columbia University student, Mahmoud Khalil, still remains in custody in Louisiana after he was detained on March 8, as the Trump administration pushes for his deportation and he sues for his release. And Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk was released earlier this month at the orders of a federal judge, over a month after her detention \u2014 which her lawyers say was prompted by nothing more than an op-ed that she co-wrote in the campus newspaper.",
      "Shortly after the commencement, Mahdawi spoke at a vigil for other students who have faced immigration scrutiny, including Khalil and Rajani Srinivasan, yet another Columbia student who self-deported to Canada after her visa was revoked.",
      "The administration has defended the moves. Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued in March \"we have a right\" to take away visas and indicated the practice could continue.",

    "summary": "Former President Joe Biden\u200b has been diagnosed with an advanced stage of prostate cancer\u200b that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones.",
    "story": [
      "Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis\u00a0with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has metastasized, or spread, to his bones prompted an outpouring of concern and questions about his condition. Those questions include how long the cancer may have taken to develop and whether he was screened for it during earlier checkups.",
      "While it's unclear exactly how long Biden has had cancer, its rapid spread is attributed to it being an aggressive form of the disease. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. The Gleason score is a system for grading the severity of prostate cancer based on analysis of cell samples under a microscope.",
      "When prostate cancer is more advanced and spreads, the bones are among the areas most likely to be affected. It\u00a0can also commonly spread to the lymph nodes, liver or lungs, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Unfortunately, late-stage cancer diagnoses are not uncommon. A 2014 analysis from Cancer Research UK, for example, found that 46% of all cancers\u00a0in that country were diagnosed at an advanced stage. A\u00a02023 study published in the journal Lancet Oncology found disruptions in care amid the pandemic also led to an increase in late-stage diagnoses across nearly all cancer types, including prostate.",
      "Slower-growing cancers can take years to develop and be detected, while more aggressive ones can become apparent more rapidly and also spread to other parts of the body quicker.",
      "Biden, who is now 82, did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup while in office, in February 2024, according to records released at the time. Experts say this is likely due to that fact that these screenings are\u00a0not routinely recommended\u00a0for men 70 years or older.",
      "\"Doctors will stop screening for prostate cancer at 75 or so, because after that, the prostate cancers you typically pick up are very slow growing, and so the harms of all of the testing and treatment for something that may not kill you \u2014 you're talking about risk versus benefit. It may not be worth the risk,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, explained on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday.",
      "Instead, Biden's diagnosis came after he recently saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms. A small nodule was found in the prostate, which necessitated further evaluation, his office said last week.",
      "\"Urinary symptoms are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate,\" Gounder said. In this case, however, the testing discovered cancer.",
      "Gounder said the situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.",
      "\"He had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look,\" she said.",
      "There have been advancements in treating advanced prostate cancer, and Gounder said the treatment goal in a case like this would be to control the cancer, slowing its progression and preserving quality of life. Biden's type of cancer is hormone-sensitive, which means it should respond to a testosterone-blocking treatment, Gounder said, adding that this might be combined with other medications or chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",
      "Back in 2019, Biden was diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate, or BPH. That December, his campaign released his medical evaluation, which noted: \"This patient has been treated for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This was initially treated with medication and was then definitively treated with surgery. He has never had prostate cancer.\"",
      "BPH is very common in older men, with around 80% of men over 70 having it, according to Yale Medicine.",
      "How do doctors screen for prostate cancer?",
      "Prostate cancer testing typically involves two methods: a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test and a digital rectal exam, or DRE. A PSA test is a type of blood test that can indicate a higher chance of prostate cancer but is not a definitive diagnosis. A DRE involves a doctor using a gloved finger to feel for any bumps on the prostate via the rectum.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of national experts, say the decision on screening for prostate cancer among men aged 55 to 69 years should be an individual one \u2014 and it recommends against PSA screening for men 70 and older.",
      "\"Many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction,\" the task force's recommendation summary notes. \"Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening.\"",
      "Prostate cancer is common, second only to skin cancer as the most common cancer affecting males, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. According to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for every 100 males, 13 will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 13:40:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress 40 years ago to promote conflict resolution and help prevent conflicts from developing.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's efforts to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace, finding that the moves led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency were made by leaders who were illegally installed and lacked the legal authority to dismantle the organization.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of several institute board members and its president, who had been fired and challenged their terminations, as well as the administration's efforts to take over and disassemble the organization. The institute's mission is to promote conflict resolution and the prevention of conflict around the world.",
      "The five board members who challenged their removals are Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig. The institute's president, Ambassador George Moose, was also ousted by ex officio board members Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "In March, Howell declined to issue emergency relief to the Institute of Peace, but said that it was \"undisputed\" that the removal of board members was not in accordance with federal law, though the plaintiffs at the time were unable to make the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "But in a 102-page decision granting the former board members request to summarily rule in their favor, Howell wrote that President Trump \"second-guessed the judgment of Congress and President Reagan in creating USIP 40 years ago, and the judgment of every Congress since then, including in 2024,\" when he signed an executive order that effectively dismantled the Institute.",
      "Howell said the purported firings of Institute of Peace board members and its president, Moose, was unlawful and ordered that they remain in their roles. The judge also found that the appointments of Jackson and Nate Cavanaugh as president of the institute are invalid, and said any actions taken by them are voided, including Cavanaugh's efforts to transfer the organization's headquarters to the General Services Administration.",
      "Howell blocked DOGE officials from gaining access to or exercising control over the U.S. Institute of Peace's offices, facilities, computer systems or other records.",
      "In her ruling, the judge criticized Trump and DOGE, writing they \"used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the president's unilateral executive branch removal power.\"",
      "The judge said that the Elon Musk-led DOGE's firing of Institute of Peace Board members, staff, and contractors, as well as its shifting of the building to be used for other purposes was unlawful.",
      "\"This administration then went even further, taking severe actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating its appointed board members, its expert management, its dedicated staff and contractors located in both Washington, D.C. and around the world, and dispersing its assets and headquarters building,\" Howell wrote. \"These actions against USIP were unlawful.\"",
      "The judge said that Article II of the Constitution places limits on the president's ability to remove executive branch subordinates, and said Mr. Trump's actions regarding the Institute of Peace were outside his legal authority.",
      "\"The president's efforts here to take over an organization outside of those bounds, contrary to statute established by Congress and by acts of force and threat using local and federal law enforcement officers, represented a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of USIP, who deserved better,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The U.S. Institute of Peace is one of several entities that has been targeted by the president and DOGE as part of his efforts to severely slash the size of the federal government. The organization was created by Congress four decades ago through a law signed by President Ronald Reagan and is characterized as an independent nonprofit corporation.",
      "But the administration has winnowed the institute's staff to five employees, and it has ceased conducting programmatic activities. The U.S. Institute of Peace's assets have also been transferred to the General Services Administration. Its Washington, D.C., headquarters is in the process of being leased to the Department of Labor, according to court records.",
      "The dispute between DOGE and the Institute of Peace started in mid-March, when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" and were accompanied by two FBI agents. DOGE officials left after being rebuffed by an Institute employee but later returned and had \"broken\" into the building and were able to access internal systems through a former security contractor for the building, court filings revealed.",
      "The Metropolitan Police Department became involved when the institute's former outside counsel reported what he said was an unlawful entry by DOGE officials.",
      "In their lawsuit, the institute's fired board members said employees with a former security contractor and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",

He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "story": [
      "Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at age 82. The former president's office said he has an \"aggressive form\" of the cancer, which has spread to his bones.",
      "His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category.",
      "Here's what to know about the disease, its symptoms and treatments:",
      "Prostate cancer symptoms",
      "Most men are diagnosed with prostate cancer before they start showing symptoms, as early warning signs of prostate cancer are rare, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. The severity of symptoms can depend on the location of the cancerous cells and how advanced the disease has become.",
      "Symptoms can include urinary issues, such as frequent urination, weak or interrupted flow, blood in urine and trouble either holding in or starting urination, according to Johns Hopkins, which says other symptoms can include difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, painful ejaculation and pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips or upper thighs.",
      "Urinary symptoms, such as frequent urination or difficulty urinating, are quite common in older men and are usually due to benign conditions like having an enlarged prostate, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder says.",
      "But in this case, Biden's office said his symptoms led to a prostate exam that resulted in the discovery of a small nodule. Further testing determined it was cancerous.",
      "Some urologists were surprised that the 82-year-old underwent prostate cancer screening at all, according to Dr. Gounder, because routine screening in men over 75 is controversial. Many prostate cancers at that age are slow-growing, and overtreatment can do more harm than good, she said.",
      "Prior to the diagnosis, Biden had received a clean bill of health during a February 2024 physical, in which he was declared \"fit to serve\" while still in office.",
      "His situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, Gounder says. The former president had new symptoms and is functionally active, which justified a closer look.",
      "Gleason score and what bone metastasis means",
      "Gleason scores are a grading system for prostate cancer, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Pathologists grade each tissue sample on a 1 to 5 scale. The lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells.",
      "Each area of prostate cancer may have a different grade, so pathologists pick the two areas that make up most of the cancer. They add the two areas' grades to come up with a Gleason score, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Biden had a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), which is determined by the pathologist who looked at cells under a microscope.",
      "A score of 9 is the second highest on the scale, which goes to 10. For scores 8, 9 and 10, the \"cells look very different from healthy cells, which is called poorly differentiated or undifferentiated,\" the Cleveland Clinic said.",
      "The categorization suggests a poor prognosis without intervention, Gounder said, but there are treatment options available that can help.",
      "Moreover, Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis came with the presence of bone metastases, meaning the disease has spread. It places him within the high/very high-risk management group.",
      "Is prostate cancer curable?",
      "Prostate cancer is often curable if it's identified and treated early, and many medical advancements have been made in recent years that can help with more severe cases.",
      "\"The good news is that prostate cancer actually has a lot of effective treatments, and so patients even who are diagnosed with more aggressive, more advanced stage disease can live many years and have good quality of life,\" said Dr. Tanya Dorff, an oncologist who treats prostate and other genitourinary cancers at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.",
      "In Biden's case \u2014 given his age and health \u2014 the goal isn't to cure the disease but to control it, to slow progression and preserve quality of life, Gounder said. Since the former president is reportedly in good functional health, more aggressive treatment is on the table. But these decisions always weigh the benefits against the potential risks and side effects, based on the individual's overall condition and priorities.",
      "While Biden's diagnosis represents a more aggressive form of prostate cancer, his office said the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive. This means the cancer should respond to testosterone-blocking treatment, since testosterone fuels prostate cancer growth, Gounder explained.",
      "Based on what is known about his diagnosis, the primary treatment would be to block testosterone with a medication like Lupron, she said. This might be combined with other hormone therapies like Zytiga, or even chemotherapy, depending on the specific case.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-medicaid-social-services-housing-nutrition/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 May 2025 06:53:37 -0400",
    "summary": "About half of states have broadened Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health care program, to pay for social services such as housing and nutritional support.",
    "story": [
      "During his first administration, President Trump's top health officials gave North Carolina permission to use Medicaid money for social services not traditionally covered by health insurance. It was a first-in-the-nation experiment to funnel health care money into housing, nutrition, and other social services.",
      "Some poor and disabled Medicaid patients became eligible for benefits, including security deposits and first month's rent for housing, rides to medical appointments, wheelchair ramps, and even prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Such experimental initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable Americans while saving taxpayers on costly medical procedures and expensive emergency room care are booming nationally. Without homes or healthy food, people risk getting sicker, becoming homeless, and experiencing even more trouble controlling chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Former President Joe Biden encouraged states to go big on new benefits, and the availability of social services exploded in states red and blue. Since North Carolina's launch, at least 24 other states have followed by expanding social service benefits covered by Medicaid, the health care program for low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 a national shift that's turning a system focused on sick care into one that prioritizes prevention. And though Mr. Trump was pivotal to the expansion, he's now reversing course regardless of whether evidence shows it works.",
      "In Mr. Trump's second term, his administration is throwing participating states from California to Arkansas into disarray, arguing that social services should not be paid for by government health insurance. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants states permission to experiment, have rescinded its previous broad directive, arguing that the Biden administration went too far.",
      "\"This administration believes that the health-related social needs guidance distracted the Medicaid program from its core mission: providing excellent health outcomes for vulnerable Americans,\" CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said in a statement.",
      "\"This decision prevents the draining of resources from Medicaid for potentially duplicative services that are already provided by other well-established federal programs, including those that have historically focused on food insecurity and affordable housing,\" Howden added, referring to food stamps and low-income housing vouchers provided through other government agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has also proposed axing funding for low-income housing and food programs administered by agencies including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture \u2014 on top of Republican proposals for broader Medicaid cuts.",
      "The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with both liberal and conservative leaders worried that the shift will upend multibillion-dollar investments already underway. Social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can cause \u2014 or worsen \u2014 physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to sky-high health care spending. Medical care delivered in hospitals and clinics, for instance, accounts for only roughly 15% of a person's overall health, while a staggering 85% is influenced by social factors such as access to healthy food and shelter for sleep, said Anthony Iton, a policy expert on social determinants of health.",
      "Health care experts warn the disinvestment will come at a price.",
      "\"It will just lead to more death, more suffering, and higher health care costs,\" said Margot Kushel, a primary care doctor in San Francisco and a leading researcher on homelessness and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced in a March 4 memo that it was rescinding Biden-era guidance dramatically expanding experimental benefits known as health-related social needs. Federal waivers are required for states to use Medicaid funds for most nontraditional social services outside of hospitals and clinics.",
      "Last month, the administration told states that these services, which can also include high-speed internet and storage units, should not be part of Medicaid.",
      "Future waiver requests allowing Medicaid to provide social services \u2014 a liberal philosophy \u2014 will be considered on a \"case-by-case basis,\" the administration said. Rather, it has signaled a conservative shift toward requiring most Medicaid beneficiaries to prove that they're working or trying to find jobs, which puts an estimated 36 million Americans at risk of losing their health coverage.",
      "\"What they're arguing is Medicaid has been expanded far beyond basic health care and it needs to be cut back to provide only basic coverage to those most desperately in need,\" said Mark Peterson, a health policy expert at UCLA. \"They're making the case, which is not widely shared by specialists in the health care field, that it's not the job of taxpayers and Medicaid to pay for all this stuff outside the traditional heath care system.\"",
      "Although states have not received formal guidance to end their social experiments, Peterson and other health policy researchers expect the administration not to renew waivers, which typically run in five-year intervals. Worse, legal experts say programs underway could be halted early.",
      "Evidence supporting social investments by Medicaid is still nascent. An expansion in Massachusetts that provided food benefits reduced ER visits and hospitalizations, for instance. But often, it's a mixed bag.",
      "California is going the biggest, investing $12 billion over five years to provide a slew of new services, from intensive case management to help people with severe behavioral health conditions to housing and food assistance through a pair of federal waivers. The most popular benefits provided by health insurers are those that help homeless people on Medicaid by placing them in apartments or securing beds in recovery homes, covering up to $5,000 for security deposits, and preventing eviction.",
      "Since the CalAIM program launched in 2022, it has served only a small fraction of the state's nearly 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries, with roughly 577,000 referrals for benefits. Yet it has improved and even saved the lives of some of those lucky enough to get help, including Eric Jones, a 65-year-old Los Angeles resident.",
      "\"When I got diabetes, I didn't know what to do and I had a hard time getting to my medical appointments,\" said Jones, who lost his housing this year when his mom died but received services through his Medi-Cal insurer, L.A. Care. \"My case manager got me rides to my appointments and also helped me get into an apartment.\"",
      "California is considering making some of its social services permanent after the CalAIM waivers expire at the end of 2026. Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration is adding more housing services, including up to six months of free rent under a third waiver approved by the Biden administration. Medi-Cal officials contended early evidence shows CalAIM has led to better care coordination and fewer hospital and ER visits.",
      "\"We are fully committed,\" said Susan Philip, a deputy director for the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program. \"We have invested so much.\"",
      "Health insurers, which deliver Medicaid coverage and receive greater funding to cover these additional benefits, say they're worried the Trump administration will end or curtail the programs. \"If we do things the same old way, we're just going to generate the same old results \u2014 people getting sicker and health care costs continuing to rise,\" said Charles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers.",
      "Industry leaders say the expansion is already changing lives.",
      "\"We believe wholeheartedly that housing is health, food is health, so seeing these programs disappear would be devastating,\" said Kelly Bruno-Nelson, executive director of Medi-Cal for CalOptima Health, a health insurance provider in Orange County.",
      "Oregon is also providing low-income Medicaid patients with a range of new services, including home-delivered healthy meals and rental payment assistance. Residents can even qualify for air conditioners, heaters, air filters, power generators, and mini fridges. State Medicaid officials say they remain committed to providing the benefits but worry about federal cuts.",
      "\"Climate change and housing instability are huge indicators of poor health,\" said Josh Balloch, vice president of health policy and communications at AllCare Health, a Medicaid insurer in Oregon. \"We hope to prove to the federal government that this is a good return on their investment.\"",
      "But even as the Trump administration curtails waivers, it is retaining discretion to provide social services in Medicaid, just on a smaller scale. Supporters say it's fair to scrutinize where to draw the line on taxpayer spending, arguing that there isn't always a direct health connection.",
      "\"We're seeing these things increase, with the free rent, and we're seeing some states pay for free internet, paying for furniture,\" said Kody Kinsley, who previously served as North Carolina's top health official. \"We know there's evidence for food and housing, but with all of these new benefits, we need to look closely at the evidence and the linkage to what actually drives health.\"",
      "Current North Carolina officials say they're confident the new social services Medicaid provides in their state have resulted in better health and lower overall spending on expensive and acute care. Medicaid recipients there can even use the program to buy farm-fresh produce.",
      "While it's too soon to know whether these experiments have been effective elsewhere in the United States, early evidence in North Carolina shows promise: The state had saved $1,020 per participant a year into its experiment \u2014 operating in mostly rural counties \u2014 by reducing ER trips and hospitalizations.",
      "State health officials also touted the economic benefits of driving business to family farms, home improvement contractors, and community-based organizations providing housing and social services.",
      "\"I welcome the challenge of demonstrating the effectiveness of our programs. It's making for healthier people and healthier budgets,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina's Medicaid program. \"Family farms that were on the verge of collapse after Hurricane Helene are now benefiting from a steady income while they also serve their community.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",
      "Another package of sanctions was imposed in 2019 as part of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the \"Caesar Act\" which Mr. Trump signed into law. The bill imposed stiff sanctions on Assad's government and companies or governments that worked with it, further crippling Syria's already isolated economy.",
      "Rubio indicated in his remarks in Turkey that relief may come in the form of waivers that give permission to do business in Syria without facing penalties for evading sanctions, which the administration can issue under authorities in the \"Caesar Act.\"",
      "\"I think we want to start with the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow in aid to begin to do so without running the risk of sanctions,\" Rubio said. He also suggested that the Trump Administration may be in a position \"soon\" to ask lawmakers to permanently repeal some sanctions.",

      "The van's tires were worn, says Linda, and the driveway too muddy. So, she drove around to the side of the house, where there was a sandy area, thinking that would give her traction.",
      "Linda Stermer: I saw the neighbors \u2026 I saw them coming up the driveway at some point.",
      "Neighbors Mike Matheny and Connie Calhoun had seen the fire and rushed over to help.",
      "Linda Stermer: Mike \u2026 he is yelling at me. \"Where's the kids? Where's Todd?\" And I'm screaming at him. He said I was incoherent, couldn't understand me because I'm hysterical. And I'm trying to tell him the kids aren't here. Todd's up there.",
      "Linda says they looked for Todd at the front of the house \u2014 where she had last seen him \u2014 but he was gone.",
      "Linda Stermer: [Looking at diagram of her property with Erin Moriarty]: We found Todd laying right here closer to the house.",
      "Somehow, Todd ended up on the side of the house, not far from where she stopped the van.",
      "Erin Moriarty [pointing at diagram]: He went from over here to here.",
      "Linda Stermer: Yes. And he was laying on his back with his head closest to the house.",
      "Linda says she has no idea how he got there but investigators later found Todd's blood on the van's front bumper and undercarriage.",
      "Todd was barely clothed when they found him, so Mike Matheny grabbed some of his own clothing from the backseat of his car and covered Todd with it.",
      "Linda Stermer: He was so badly burnt \u2026 And he was alive. He was looking at me, but he couldn't talk. And I laid there just begging him not to leave me.",
      "When emergency medical technicians arrived, they tried to save Todd.",
      "Linda Stermer: And they said they couldn't hook up a defibrillator to him, 'cause he was too badly burned. \u2026 When they stopped working on him, I was so, so angry at them. \u2026 Why didn't they get him in the ambulance? Why did they waste so much time trying there? [crying] Can we take a break please?",
      "Trevor Stermer: Anytime we would ask any details on the case or what happened that day \u2026 she would start crying and look for sympathy from you and play the victim.",
      "The couple's sons, Trevor and Trenton Stermer, began to suspect there was more to the story, when their mother seemed reluctant to share certain details.",
      "Trevor Stermer: I asked her about the van and if she had run him over. And she said she didn't want to talk about it \u2026 And that I should just believe her, but her story just wasn't adding up.",
      "Trenton Stermer: It didn't make sense that our father, who was in great shape \u2026 it didn't make sense that he would die in a house fire and she wouldn't.",
      "They say their parent's marriage had been rocky for some time and it all seemed to come to a head on the eve of the fire \u2014 when Todd and Linda got into a shouting match.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was that the worst fight you'd ever seen your parents in?",
      "Trevor Stermer Yeah. \u2026 this was absolutely the worst. \u2026 All of us knew that this was gonna be the one that ended their marriage.",
      "The fight, they say, was a familiar one: over finances and infidelity.",
      "Trenton Stermer: It seems like he found out that she was having an affair, essentially and had a separate life.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you ever unfaithful to Todd?",
      "Linda Stermer: No.",
      "Linda Stermer: Todd was an extremely jealous and possessive person.",
      "Linda says she and Todd fought about money, because they were near financial ruin she says, thanks to Todd.",
      "Linda Stermer: Todd owned his own business. He sold gloves and occasionally sold hunting suits \u2026 But he didn't like to work often. And I learned about him borrowing money from his mother. \u2026 And I said, \"why would you do that? Why aren't you just going to work?\" I was working in a dialysis facility. I had to be to work at 5:00 a.m.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How much in debt was he?ibi",
      "Linda Stermer: At the time of his death, $75,000. \u2026 He hadn't paid our mortgage in several months. \u2026 And he just blew money, just blew money.",
      "But Trenton and Trevor say the real drain on the family's finances was Linda's obsession with horses. They claim their dad was upset to learn that Linda had a line of credit for $25,00, to support the 31 horses she had on their property.",
      "Trenton Stermer: The horses were always a topic of discussion between them of it was running us dry.",
      "Linda Stermer: I don't know where they would have gotten that idea from.",
      "Linda claims she was actually making money boarding those horses.",
      "Linda Stermer: The horses were self-sufficient. \u2026 Todd always told me that if I didn't make enough money with the horses that I couldn't have the horses.",
      "Whatever they were arguing about, 24 hours later Todd was dead, and investigators were suspicious. They started taking a long hard look at Linda's actions on the day of the fire. For instance, she had gone to a gas station early that morning, and a clerk would later say it looked like Linda was pumping fuel not into her vehicle \u2014 but into a gas can. And in fact, a can was found by investigators in the Stermer's front yard.",
      "TROUBLE AT HOME",
      "Linda Stermer says her early morning trip to the gas station the day that the house fire killed her husband Todd was perfectly innocent.",
      "Linda Stermer: We were out of milk.",
      "She says she bought some groceries and topped off the gas in her SUV \u2014 and that's all she did. a receipt would later show she spent just over $11 at the pump.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You didn't fill up the tank.",
      "Linda Stermer: It didn't need a whole lot.",
      "She claims she wanted to make sure there was plenty of gas for her sons, because when she got home, she woke them and told them to leave in her car.",
      "Linda Stermer: I \u2026 told them that they could go to the movies with their friend. \u2026 I didn't want them hearing Todd and I argue.",
      "Linda and Todd had been fighting since the previous day. She says their marriage was coming to an end, that she was getting ready to leave Todd that day and wanted the boys out of the way.",
      "Linda Stermer: I just felt like being in the house with us watching me move out, was gonna be too much for them.",
      "After 13 years of marriage, it was a decision that had been a long time in the making.",
      "When Linda first met Todd in 1989, she says there was an instant attraction.",
      "Linda Stermer: He was so beautiful, so charismatic. You could just see the light in his eyes.",
      "They were both 25 when they started dating. Linda was separated at the time, with two young daughters: 3-year-old Ashley and 2-year-old Brittany. It was clear Todd wanted the whole package.",
      "Linda Stermer: I said, \"I'm in the middle of a divorce,\" and I said, \"I have two little girls.\" And he says, \"Well, that's perfect. I'll only make boys.\" [laughs] Like, what?",
      "By the time they got married in August of 1993, Linda had given birth to their two sons, Trevor and Trenton.",
      "Linda Stermer: He did not have to marry me. \u2026 We just wanted to be a family. \u2026 Todd was the epitome of family.",
      "Trenton Stermer: He was a great man, great father. Coached all of us through as many sports as he could \u2026 and definitely a family man.",
      "He was such a devoted family man, says Linda, he even offered to take in her nephew, Cory, to save him from a broken home.",
      "Linda Stermer: Todd sat me down one night and he said, \"Do you want him to come and live here with us? Maybe that would be good for him.\"",
      "Cory Pierce was 2 years old when they took him in.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You miss your dad?",
      "Cory Pierce: Yeah. \u2026 He loved to play sports with us and hang out with us, he'd go out in the yard to play with us and he was really athletic.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did he ever treat any of these kids differently?",
      "Linda Stermer: Oh, no. Anybody who he had ever, ever introduced his family to \u2014 \"these are my sons, these are my daughters.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: It sounds at that point your relationship was pretty ideal.",
      "Linda Stermer: Amazing. It was amazing.",
      "But that happiness, says Linda, didn't last very long. It turns out Todd had a temper.",
      "Ashley Gibson | Daughter: The first incident I just remember my stepdad, like, throwing a clothes basket of laundry \u2026 at my mom. I remember him going out with friends at night and my mom having to load all of us kids up in the car to go pick him up at a friend's house where he was drunk and just belligerent and screaming at her and ...",
      "Brittany Gibson | Daughter: It got like so bad. It scared us. We were young then.",
      "Ashley Gibson says that when she was about 11 years old and started speaking up, she became a target of that anger.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What would he say to you Ashley?",
      "Ashley Gibson: \"You're a two-legged dog just like your mom. You're gonna be a whore just like she is.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Would he hit you?",
      "Ashley Gibson: Oh, yeah.",
      "Erin Moriarty: With what?",
      "Ashley Gibson: His hand, belts. \u00a0\u2026 Horse reigns. \u2026 \u00a0A phone in the middle of the forehead [cries].",
      "Linda says Todd also hit her.",
      "Linda Stermer: It wasn't a regular thing. \u2026 He would get extremely fired up and extremely frustrated. And he hit me one time and left a bruise on my cheek. \u2026 But he sent me flowers. \u2026 He told me how sorry he was. \u2026 And then you believe that it's never going to happen again, until it does.",
      "But Trenton, Trevor and Cory say they never actually saw their father hit their sister, Ashley, or their mother.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you see your dad ever be abusive to your mom?",
      "Cory Pierce: No. I never seen him physically harm her.",
      "Trenton Stermer: \u2026 we never saw a black eye or bruises.",
      "Trevor Stermer: Our father definitely had a temper. And perhaps he grabbed her and squeezed her arm maybe a little too hard \u2026 But never any hitting.",
      "Marti, Linda's mother, says she never really trusted Todd.",
      "Marti Bakhuyzen: He could be charming. He could be the most charming man you've ever met. And he could turn and be the worst person in the world.",
      "And Linda, she says, took the brunt of it.",
      "Marti Bakhuyzen: He was very controlling. \u00a0\u2026 if anything went wrong, it was her fault.",
      "Linda says she later found out that Todd had an arrest record dating back to before they were married. There were two convictions for misdemeanor drug charges, a DUI, and a conviction for misdemeanor assault and battery when he was 18 years old.",
      "Marti Bakhuyzen: I went out there one time and \u2026 I says if anything ever happened to her, I know who to blame.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you really worried he might hurt Linda?",
      "Marti Bakhuyzen: Yes, I was.",
      "Linda says not long before the fire, she was ready to call it quits, and started talking to a divorce attorney.",
      "Brittany Gibson: She told me that she had planned on leaving \u2026 it was getting, you know, to be too much.",
      "On January 6, 2007, the night before the fire, then-20-year-old Ashley says she called the Stermer home to speak to her mother.",
      "Ashley Gibson: I've never gotten to talk to anybody about this, so it's really hard for me \u2026",
      "Todd answered the phone.",
      "Ashley Gibson: He said, \"Your mom's not here.\" And he's, like, \"but I had a conversation with God. \u2026 I'm not decided yet, but one of us is leaving in a body bag. And it's either me or your mom.\"",
      "THE CASE AGAINST LINDA STERMER",
      "After Todd Stermer's death, Van Buren County Sheriff's detectives spent two years investigating \u2014 focusing on the troubled Stermer marriage, and the fact that Todd's wife Linda ran him over when he escaped the fire.",
      "Then, on June 5, 2009, the prosecutor's office felt it had enough evidence to arrest Linda Stermer on charges of arson and murder.",
      "Trevor Stermer | Son: For so long we had all held the notion in our head that it was possible that she killed our father. \u2026 But when all the details and the evidence came out, it was just overwhelming.",
      "On January 5, 2010, Linda went on trial. The evidence was mainly circumstantial, focusing on Linda's actions before and after the fire. Her sons testified she pushed them to go to the movies that Sunday morning.",
      "Trevor Stermer: Saying, \"You need to get up. \u2026 You need to go. You need to leave the house right now.\"",
      "Trenton Stermer: I went to go say goodbye to our father \u2014",
      "Trevor Stermer: \u2014she physically stopped us. She said, \"No he's sleeping. Don't go over there.\"",
      "They now believe their dad had been sedated.",
      "Trevor Stermer: I believe that he was drugged just because he was clearly incapacitated in the living room.",
      "Bolstering that theory was Kate Fox, a former friend and coworker of Linda's. Fox testified that Linda confided in her, saying she was afraid investigators would find a coffee cup she used to try to drug Todd.",
      "But Linda's trial attorney, Jeffrey Getting says, there was no evidence that Todd was drugged.",
      "Jeff Getting: The evidence introduced at the trial was \u2026 contained in the autopsy report, which didn't find any significant evidence of sedatives \u2026",
      "But Kate Fox also testified that Linda had discussed ways of getting rid of her husband, including running him over with a car.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did you?",
      "Linda Stermer: No. \u2026 Kate really hated me at that point.",
      "Linda says that by trial their friendship had ended, and that Fox lied on the witness stand because, among other things, she was angry at Linda for changing her shift at work.",
      "Linda Stermer: My lawyer asked her why she was so angry at me \u2026 And she says, \"she lied to me. She lied to me. She changed shifts without me.\"",
      "But Kate Fox also provided a motive for murder, telling jurors that, at the time of the fire, Linda was having an affair with a coworker named Chris Williams. That testimony was backed up by Williams himself, who claimed that he and Linda had a \"romantic relationship\" while she was \"a married woman.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you having an affair with Chris Williams?",
      "Linda Stermer:\u00a0 I started seeing Chris Williams romantically, but it wasn't until after I lost my husband.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why would a man you went out with turn around and lie at trial?",
      "Linda Stermer: Unless he was manipulated by someone, I don't know.",
      "Linda says that Kate Fox was so angry, she convinced Williams to lie about when the relationship began. The defense presented evidence that Fox had a history of mental illness and her own brother took the stand and said her stories couldn't be trusted.",
      "Stephen Berry | Kate Fox's brother: I do know my sister she can manipulate the \u2014 the truth to whatever she wants it to be. \u2026 And yeah, she will lie if it's \u2014 if it's to her benefit.",
      "But it may have been Linda's early morning trip to the gas station that was most damaging to her case.\u00a0 Remember, she says she went out to buy milk and top off the gas tank in her car. But a gas station clerk testified she thought she saw Linda at the back of her car, seemingly pumping gas not into her vehicle, but into a gas can, like the one found on the scene. It's something Linda denies.",
      "Linda Stermer: It was frigid. And I had winter gloves and a warmer coat back there. \u2026 So I got my gloves out to pump gas.",
      "As for the gas can found at the house, Linda says they lived on a farm, and there were gas cans everywhere.",
      "A jailhouse informant testified that while in custody, Linda told her she started the fire while Todd was asleep. Another informant said Linda hit Todd over the head with a blunt object. Getting tried to poke holes in their testimony.",
      "Jeff Getting: They were inconsistent. They both had problems \u2014 with mental illness.",
      "The prosecutor argued that Linda started the fire by dousing Todd with gasoline \u2014 and his sweatpants, underwear and socks did test positive. But defense attorney Getting never called his own fire expert to refute any of that.",
      "Linda Stermer: I begged him numerous times for an expert and he says, \"We don't need an expert, Linda. We will use their expert for our benefit,\"",
      "Getting says his plan was to agree the fire was arson, but to convince jurors that it was Todd who started it.",
      "Jeff Getting: Todd is in the middle of the fire. \u2026 The best defense in this case is Todd set the fire and was accidentally killed in the fire that he set.",
      "In fact, Todd Stermer had twice been suspected by police of arson in the past. Two other properties he owned mysteriously burned to the ground. Both times, Todd was reportedly in debt and needed money. But Todd was never charged, and in his closing argument, the prosecutor called the claim nonsense and reminded the jury that when Todd escaped the burning house, Linda ran him over. He also said Linda owned two cell phone and should have been able to call 911.",
      "Linda Stermer: And he pointed his finger in my face just inches away from my face. And he says, \"She's a liar, a manipulator, a diabolical murderer.\"",
      "That may have crossed a line but Getting never objected. Just hours after the case went to the jury, the judge read their verdict:",
      "JUDGE: Count one, guilty as charged. Count two, guilty as charged.",
      "Linda Stermer: All I could think was I have to be strong because my mom's right behind me.",
      "Linda's sons say the jury got it right.",
      "Trenton Stermer: We knew it in our hearts that she was guilty. \u2026 And it felt like we could finally breathe again.",
      "Linda's daughter, Ashley, has barely spoken to her brothers since that day.",
      "Ashley Gibson: I lost my brothers, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles. \u2026 because I believed in my mom.",

      "LINDA STERMER IN COURT: I am determined and hopeful that I will get back to my children someday.",
      "Determined to free her mother, Linda's daughter, Brittany, begged well-respected fire investigator Robert Trenkle to reexamine her mother's case.",

      "LINDA PETITIONS THE COURT",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you went to prison, did you think, \"this is it?\"",

      "Over the next 5 years, Linda Stermer filed appeal after appeal in state court, all the way to Michigan's Supreme Court; all of them denied.",
      "Linda Stermer: It was devastating. It was really devastating.",
      "Then she turned to the federal court and took advantage of a prison resource: the law library.",
      "Linda Stermer: I was in that law library almost every single day of the week. And I learned as much as I could. And I had people on the outside who were mailing me information on wrongful arson convictions and giving me an idea on where to go with things.",
      "Linda wrote her own petition to the federal court. In part, she blamed her conviction on her own defense attorney, who had chosen not to hire a fire expert. An expert, like veteran fire investigator Robert Trenkle, who would have testified there wasn't enough evidence to prove the fire that killed Todd Stermer was deliberately set.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How would you describe the investigation that was made into this case? Adequate?",
      "Robert Trenkle: No, absolutely not adequate. Inadequate. Just the opposite.",
      "For example, Trenkle says, investigators failed to sift through the remains of the house and took very few samples of debris.",
      "Robert Trenkle: If you think the fire started the living room, it started in the center of that living room \u2026 you're going to have to take that floor and move it out to the outside. Look at what kind of burn patterns are on that floor to give you that reason to be able to believe that \u2026 and then take a sample and see if you have something.",
      "Trenkle says the evidence doesn't support the state's theory that Linda doused Todd with gasoline and then set him on fire.",
      "Robert Trenkle: I've asked probably 30 or 40 people who are firefighters, investigators \u2026 And they all laughed when I told them about somebody getting out of a building after they \u2026 had gasoline poured all over them.",
      "And when asked about the gasoline found on Todd's clothing? Well, Trenkle says it was likely a case of cross-contamination. Remember that neighbor who came to the rescue that day? He recycled auto parts for a living, and a shirt he used to cover Todd also tested positive for gas.",
      "And then there's the fact that no gasoline was found on Linda's clothing.",
      "Robert Trenkle: If you get one little speck on your finger, you try to wash it off and wash it off to wash it off, it's still there. So, it should've been smelled on Ms. Stermer. And it should certainly have been on something that she was wearing.",
      "Trenkle says there simply isn't enough evidence to prove arson, but even if there was, the more likely suspect was Todd Stermer himself.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And why do you believe that?",
      "Robert Trenkle: Because of his burn injuries \u2026 It certainly shows that Mr. Stermer was in the area of the fire.",
      "In 2016, an attorney filed Linda's amended petition, which included Trenkle's findings. Two years later, a judge responded \u2014 granting her another day in court.",
      "In October 2018, Federal Judge Arthur J. Tarnow held an evidentiary hearing in Linda's case.",
      "Linda Stermer: I knew that the science was the key. \u2026 There is no evidence to support a theory of arson.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you believe started that fire then?",
      "Linda Stermer: I believe that something came out of that fireplace - a coal or a log or something fell out, popped out, and started that floor on fire.",
      "The state's fire expert testified that he followed proper investigative procedures and didn't take samples of the remains because he saw no evidentiary value in them.",
      "When Jeff Getting took the stand to defend his work, the judge was quite stern with him.",
      "Jeff Getting: He was critical of me \u2026 He was critical of the entirety of \u2014 of this trial.",
      "But Getting says he still believes he presented the only case he could have\u2014that Todd Stermer started the fire that ended his life.",
      "Jeff Getting: This defense to the case was the one that I felt, my client felt, we together felt gave us the best likelihood of success.",
      "Two months later, just before Christmas 2018, Judge Tarnow issued his ruling.",
      "He found the prosecutor was wrong telling jurors that Linda had two cell phones when there was no evidence of that and he also found fault with the defense, saying Getting failed his client by not calling a fire expert. The judge also pointed out that although Kate Fox's trial testimony was incriminating, she did suffer from mental health problems, and that her brother testified she was known to be untruthful. The judge also agreed that if there was an arson, \"significant evidence pointed the finger of suspicion at Mr. Stermer.\"",
      "In December 2018, nearly 12 years after the fire and after spending almost 9 years in prison, Linda Stermer's conviction was overturned and Judge Tarnow set her free.",

      "Erin Moriarty: The fact that a judge took a look at the evidence, and didn't feel she had a fair trial, thought she might be innocent, that doesn't change the way you feel?",

      "But their sisters, who believe in their mother's innocence, are afraid they could lose her again.",

      "That's a real possibility. Linda Stermer has been free for a little over a year, but Michigan's Attorney General is appealing the federal decision and is asking for Linda's conviction to be reinstated.",
      "That was a real possibility. Linda had been free since December 20, 2018, but Michigan's attorney general appealed the federal decision and asked for Linda's conviction to be reinstated. Her new attorney Wolfgang Mueller said he would fight it.",
      "Wolfgang Mueller: I think I have a pretty good B.S. meter. And I believe her completely in terms of her story and then how the science just doesn't add up to an arson. \u2026 And I think she was truly \u2014 one, factually innocent of this crime, and two, the whole system betrayed her.",
      "Linda's future now rested with the Federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio.\u00a0 Mueller would have 15 minutes to convince a panel of judges that Linda didn't get a fair trial. The state would get the same amount of time to argue that she did.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Are you scared?",

      "Trevor Stermer: Potentially. \u2026 I'd like to see how she weasels her way out of this...",
      "But when the hearing began, no one from Todd Stermer's side of the family appeared. Camera's weren't allowed in federal court, but an audio recording was later made public.",

In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",
      "\"Ashli was unarmed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Ashli posed no threat to the safety of anyone.\"",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimatedin a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",
      "If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republicans are also eyeing changes.",
      "Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks, pointing out that the reductions in social safety net programs comes as many wealthy taxpayers would get a big tax break.",
      "\"This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told CNN's \"State of the Union\u2033 on Sunday. \"There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.\"",
      "The lowest-income Americans would end up paying more under the proposed GOP bill, according to a May 19\u00a0analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania group that studies the fiscal impact of public policies. Even including savings from tax cuts, the bottom 20%, who earn up to $17,000 per year, would take a $1,035 hit in 2026 after the reductions in Medicaid and other programs are factored in.",
      "\"[H]ouseholds most affected by the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 those in the bottom income quintile \u2014 experience the largest losses under this bill, averaging $28,000 in lifetime value for the working-age population,\" the Penn Wharton Budget model calculated. \"In contrast, working-age households in the top income quintile generally benefit from lower taxes, gaining an average of $30,000.\"",

If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"",

    "summary": "An Indiana man convicted in the 2000 fatal shooting of a police officer is set to receive a lethal injection this week in the state's second execution in 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "An Indiana man convicted in the 2000 killing of a police officer was put to death by lethal injection early Tuesday in the state's second execution since 2009. Indiana resumed executions in December after a 15-year hiatus.",
      "Benjamin Ritchie, 45, had been on death row for more than two decades following his conviction in the fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a foot chase.",
      "Ritchie was executed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Indiana Department of Correction officials. IDOC said in an online statement the execution process started shortly after midnight and he was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m.",
      "Ritchie told a parole board earlier this month that he had changed during his more than two decades behind bars. He apologized for his actions, which led to the killing of the 31-year-old married father of two children.",
      "\"I've ruined my life and other people's lives, and I'm so sorry for that night,\" he said. \"If I could go back and just shake that kid, because he wouldn't listen to nobody. You can't take back what you did.\"",
      "Indiana codes require death row inmates to be executed before sunrise on the day their executions are scheduled to take place, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPI), a nonprofit organization that researches and collects data on capital punishment.",
      "Indiana resumed executions after a hiatus due to scarcity of lethal injection drugs that affected correctional departments nationwide. Following its last execution in 2009, the state incorporated a new lethal drug into its protocol to account for the shortage, without releasing any public information about the change. In 2017, the Indiana Court of Appeals voided the new protocol, ruling that the state's Department of Corrections violated rule-making procedures when it made that change covertly and adopted a protocol that had never been used before in the execution chamber, according to the Death Penalty Information Center,\u00a0 Indiana has faced criticism over its death penalty proceedings, which for many years have been among the most secretive in the country.",
      "Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber in advance of Joseph Corcoran's execution in December. The images showed a space that looks like a sparse operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting, a floor drain and an adjacent viewing room. The state has offered few other details about the process, including the time the executions take place.",
      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century. The Associated Press and other media organizations have filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana seeking media access.",
      "The execution Tuesday in Indiana is among 12 scheduled in eight states this year. Ritchie's execution and two others in Texas and Tennessee will be carried out this week.",
      "Ritchie was 20 when he and others stole a van in Beech Grove, near Indianapolis. He then fired four shots at Toney during a foot chase, killing him.",
      "At the time Ritchie was on probation from a 1998 burglary conviction.",
      "Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. He was the first officer of the police department of roughly 30 officers to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty. The community of 14,000 people mourned the married father of two as a neighborly person who showed up to help others.",
      "When Toney died, \"Everyone of us involved, including Bill, had something stolen from them that they'll never get back,\" said Deputy Police Chief Tom Hurrle, who worked with him.",
      "Relatives spoke at a clemency hearing last week, urging for the execution to move forward.",
      "\"It's time. We're all tired,\" said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney's wife. \"It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It's time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill's life, and not his death.\"",
      "Ritchie's attorneys have fought the death penalty sentence, arguing his legal counsel at trial was ineffective because his lawyers failed to fully investigate and present evidence on his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure.",
      "Current defense attorneys say Ritchie suffered \"severe brain damage\" because his mother abused alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and has struggled with decision-making. He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005.",
      "\"He's finally come to have some coping skills. He's a different man,\" said defense attorney Steven Schutte.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid last week as the parole board recommended. Braun didn't explain his decision, but board members said Ritchie's case didn't meet the bar for commuting a sentence and cited a dozen violations during Ritchie's time in prison, including threatening others with violence.",
      "The Indiana Supreme Court denied a request to stop the execution, but two justices noted the jury didn't get accurate information about Ritchie's brain damage.",
      "Ritchie's attorneys are challenging that decision in federal court and have also filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Disability rights advocates say Ritchie's brain damage should exclude him from the death penalty.",
      "Ritchie's \"capacity to fully appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct\" was \"impaired at the time of his crime,\" Dr. Megan Carter, who also testified before the parole board, said in a statement.",
      "Attorneys say Ritchie has changed during his more than two decades behind bars and shown remorse.",
      "In court as a young man, Ritchie smiled at Horen and laughed as the verdict was read.",
      "He told a parole board he deeply regrets his actions, especially how he acted with Toney's widow.",
      "\"I wish I could go back to the day in court, because that man's wife deserved to say everything she needed to say to me, and that punk kid should have just kept his mouth shut and let her say whatever she needed to say,\" Ritchie said. \"That was her right. That was his family's right.\"",
      "Ritchie spent his last days getting visits from friends and family. Under state law, he was allowed up to five witnesses at his execution, which was expected to include attorneys and friends.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill on Monday night after Democratic opposition\u00a0tanked an initial attempt to advance the measure earlier this month amid concern over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family.",
      "The first-of-its-kind legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. After the measure advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, Senate GOP leadership first brought the measure to the floor earlier this month. But the measure had lost Democratic support in the intervening weeks amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining the support of some Democratic holdouts.",
      "Monday's vote was to limit debate on the bill, allowing the Senate to move forward to final passage.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking the measure from advancing earlier this month, saying Monday, \"this bill reflects the bipartisan consensus on this issue, and it's had an open and bipartisan process since the very beginning.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, argued that Senate Democrats \"inexplicably chose to block this legislation\" earlier this month.",
      "Since the failed vote earlier this month, negotiators returned to the table. And ahead of the procedural vote Monday, the measure saw backing from at least one Democrat as Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia advocated for the measure, calling it a \"meaningful step forward,\" though he added that it's \"not perfect.\"",
      "\"The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\" Warner said in a statement. \"We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\"",
      "Still, Warner pointed to concerns he said are shared among many senators about the Trump family's \"use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,\" after it was announced earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.",
      "Warner said senators \"have a duty to shine a light on these abuses,\" but he argued \"we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has been among the leading voices advocating for adding anti-corruption reforms to the legislation. Warren has outlined a handful of issues with the bill, saying that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Warren said her concerns have not been addressed and urged her colleagues to vote against the updated version.",
      "\"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all,\" Warren said. \"A bill that meaningfully strengthens oversight of the stablecoin market is worth enacting. A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the president's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\"",

He outlined that a lack of regulatory framework, which the bill would provide, makes for uncertainty \u2014 and results in innovative technology moving offshore.

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to revoke the Temporary Protected Status program, or TPS, for Venezuelans in February.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will let the Trump administration end the Temporary Protected Status program protecting roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants from the threat of deportation while legal proceedings over the move continue.",
      "The high court granted the administration's request to lift for now a lower court's injunction that blocked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's revocation of the Temporary Protected Status program, or TPS, for Venezuelans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would deny the administration's bid for emergency relief.",
      "Noem terminated the designation \u2014 which had been extended by the Biden administration \u2014 in February, a move that would have cleared the way for Venezuelans to lose their government-issued work permits and deportations protections on April 7. But a federal judge in California blocked the action in late March and said her decision to terminate the TPS program for the Venezuelan migrants appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" and may have been motivated by unconstitutional animus.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide emergency relief to the Trump administration and pause the district court's order, leading the Trump administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect, the secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is 'contrary to the national interest,'\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration's emergency appeal with the high court.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, DHS's assistant secretary for public affairs, called the high court's ruling a \"win for the American people and the safety of our communities.\"",
      "Congress in 1990 created the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation, set to last 18 months, in October 2023.",
      "In addition to designating Venezuela for TPS, the Biden administration also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Venezuelan program is the largest and covers roughly 600,000 people through two separate designations, though only the designation from 2023 is at issue in the case before the Supreme Court.",
      "After Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated the extension for more than 350,000 Venezuelans, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7. The Trump administration is also revoking TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians, with that move set to take effect in August.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision to end the protections for Venezuelans, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor, stopping Noem's termination determination from taking effect nationwide.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's order \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's injunction \"ill-considered.\"",
      "But in response to the request, lawyers for TPS beneficiaries told the Supreme Court in a filing that lifting the district court's injunction would harm the nearly 350,000 people who would immediately lose their right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "\"Staying the district court's order would cause far more harm than it would stop,\" they wrote. \"It would radically shift the status quo, stripping plaintiffs of their legal status and requiring them to return to a country the State Department still deems too dangerous even to visit.\"",
      "They said that the TPS statute does not grant the Homeland Security secretary authority to vacate or rescind an extension, and Noem's terminations of TPS extensions for Venezuela and Haiti were the first and second times that a secretary has set an extension aside in the statute's history.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of more than a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court, and one of several involving his immigration plans.",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments on May 15 on the Trump administration's request to narrow nationwide injunctions blocking enforcement of an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",

      "A Delaware animal shelter is trying to care for and rehome thousands of chicks that survived being left in a postal service truck for three days. Trapped in a warm enclosure, without food and water, thousands died before they were discovered on May 2, CBS affiliate WBOC reported.",
      "The involved parties are still awaiting answers as to how 12,000 chicks were abandoned within the truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. The United States Postal Service said in an email to the Associated Press that it was aware of a process breakdown and was actively investigating what occurred.",
      "The USPS says it has been working with hatcheries for more than 100 years to transport mail-order chicks and that it transports thousands of chicks every year, according to its website.",
      "\"Chicks can be safely transported without food or water within 72 hours of hatching. In fact, placing food and water inside the hatchery box could jeopardize the integrity of the box and could endanger the health and safety of the animals inside,\"\u00a0the Postal Service website says.",
      "Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery raised the shipped chicks for their weekly distribution to clients across the country, said a spokesperson for the company. Due to biosecurity concerns, the hatchery cannot take the chicks back.",
      "The chicks were supposed to be delivered to several states, including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and more but the entire shipment was mistakenly sent to Delaware following shipping delays and rejections from distribution centers across the country, WBOC reported.",
      "The hatchery's spokesperson said it would have been best if USPS, after discovering the chicks, had completed delivery, as the recipients would have been adequately equipped to handle the birds \u2014 even malnourished ones.",
      "\"After three and a half days in the heat, these crates were wet with dead fowl. It was a mess,\" John Parana, executive director at First State Animal Center and SPCA, told CBS affiliate WBNS-TV.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving chicks have been nursed and cared for at the shelter, Parana said.",
      "Last Tuesday, the shelter began offering the birds for adoption, but only a few hundred out of thousands have been picked up. There is no complete count of the chicks, as the shelter has no feasible way to do so, but Parana estimates there to be more than two thousand available.",
      "Some have inquired about buying the birds for meat, but, as a no-kill shelter and SPCA, those were refused.",
      "The strain has turned the animal care center into a 24/7 operation and necessitated a staffing increase, Parana said. Money remains the biggest concern for the donation-reliant nonprofit. Some employees have begun spending their money to support the operations, he added.",
      "Among the birds were young turkeys, geese and quail, but the vast majority were Freedom Ranger chicks. One concern for the shelter, Parana explained, was the increasing demand for space and feed over time, as Freedom Rangers take about ten weeks to reach maturity.",
      "The Delaware Department of Agriculture, after a call from USPS, directed the animals to the shelter, which shares a memorandum of understanding with the animal center as a state vendor.

Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",

But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",

      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",

We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",

      "Doctors are running out of supplies \u2014 barely able to treat malnourished children, let alone the hundreds of people injured by the Israeli strikes who stream in day after day.",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and left 251 others as hostages in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, displaced 90% of its population \u2014 most of them multiple times \u2014 and killed more than 53,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

Billed as \"Magnus Carlsen vs. The World,\" the online match began April 4 on Chess.com, the world's largest chess website, and was the first-ever online freestyle game to feature a world champion.",
      "The mega-match ended after Team World checked Carlsen's king a third time, a stunning outcome after Chess.com had predicted Carlsen would win by a wide margin.",
      "Team World voted on each move and each side had 24 hours to make their play. Carlsen played the white pieces.",
      "The world won on move 32 after checking Carlsen's king three times in the corner of the board where it could not escape. The rule is called \"threefold repetition,\" meaning all of the pieces on the board are in the exact same position three times to prompt a draw.",
      "Carlsen, 34, became the world's top-ranked player in 2010 aged 19 and has won five World Championships. He achieved the highest-ever chess rating of 2882 in 2014 and has remained the undisputed world number one for more than a decade.",
      "\"Overall, 'the world' has played very, very sound chess from the start. Maybe not going for most enterprising options, but kind of keeping it more in vein with normal chess \u2014 which isn't always the best strategy, but it worked out well this time,\" Carlsen said in a statement Friday as Monday's draw seemed imminent.",
      "Because it was a freestyle match, the bishops, knights, rooks, queen and king were randomly shuffled around the board while the pawns remained in their usual spots. Freestyle chess is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorization.",
      "This was the third \"vs. The World\" record-setting online game. In 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played against more than 50,000 people on the Microsoft Network and won after four months.",

Local officials said the young wild elephant crossing the track near Habarana was run over by the same train involved in the February 20 accident that killed seven elephants. After that crash, officials imposed speed limits on trains passing through elephant habitats.",
      "No passengers were injured in the accident, which occurred some 110 miles by road east of the capital Colombo.",

One week ago, he was reunited with his family in a deal brokered by the Trump administration and led by the White House's Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff.",

      "Edan Alexander spent 584 days in Hamas captivity. After a number of false starts and false hope for his release, when the call finally did come from the highest levels of the U.S. government, his father missed it \u2014 eight times.",
      "\"So, we were all at home in Jersey after the Mother's Day brunch that we had,\" recalled his mother, Yael.",
      "\"I was blowing out some leaves,\" said his father, Adi. When he put down the leaf blower, he realized he had \"missed eight phone calls from Steve Witkoff.\"",
      "When Adi finally got in touch with the senior White House envoy, \"he told us in 10 minutes from now, Hamas will be announcing about your son's release tomorrow.\"",
      "\"I thanked him. Non-stop; 'Thank you, Steve! Thank you so much,'\" Yael recalled saying down the phone line. \"It's the happiest Mother's Day ever!\"",
      "\"We were like, yelling, like crazy with the kids,\" she said. As Yael, Adi and their two other children watched the television, the announcement came that Edan would be released the following day, just as Witkoff had promised. \"And we were like, okay, we need to pack! We need to... Get to Israel!\"",
      "Finally, the reunion they'd dreamt of for more than a year and a half was taking shape.",
      "Adi booked a flight immediately. Yael had already booked one for later that same day, in a sheer stroke of luck, planning to go and be with family in Israel right after marking Mother's Day.",
      "Neither of the parents got much rest on their flights to Israel.",
      "\"I couldn't sleep the whole flight,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Like, you're alert ... I couldn't sit even, you know? I was like in full adrenaline, like, ready, to be there and to get Edan back, you know?\"",
      "As soon as they touched down, they were whisked away to an Israeli military base, where Edan soon arrived after being handed over by Hamas.",
      "\"Definitely I gave him like, the biggest hug ever,\" said his mother. \"When I came to him, I came in full power! We almost fell, because he was weak, and he was very excited, like he was standing, like shivering, you know, because, wow, it's unbelievable \u2014 and I'm screaming, and I am like, you know, holding him. It was \u2014 wow.\"",
      "The parents said Edan remains weak, but doctors cleared him for release from the hospital where he's been treated. He's still getting medical attention for some minor injuries sustained during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, which his mom and dad said, \"nobody took care of in those tunnels.\"",
      "Even getting his freedom back was a harrowing ordeal.",
      "\"The day of release was a very busy day for him,\" father Adi told CBS News. \"It took forever. They moved around and crawled under, and it was a very tough day on him. He didn't sleep the whole night before that, because he was excited, he didn't sleep. He was like, super, super tired, so it took like, almost two days after for him to decompress from the day of the release.\"",
      "Since then, Edan has given them some details about his captivity, but they aren't pushing him.",
      "\"He talks a lot about it, but no rush. We're not asking. If you want to say something, you say, and we're not pushing,\" said his father. \"He went through a lot of stuff.\"",
      "\"He's just happy to be home, you know, just to sit with Mika and Roy [his siblings] and just to hang out and just be with us and watch TV yesterday,\" his parents said.",
      "During his long captivity, Edan saw his parents on the news, pleading for his release.",
      "\"I think the fact that he saw us, saw us running and fighting and knocking on every door, kept him hopeful,\" said his father, along with \"the fact that he was held with other hostages all together, and not by himself, kept him hopeful. And he's just a strong kid, you know, strong mentally and physically.\"",
      "Hamas has held many of its hostages in tunnels under the Gaza Strip, with many, including Alexander, saying they never saw daylight at all.",
      "\"I'm so pale,\" his mother recalled him saying. \"I look like a vampire!\"",
      "Israel has stepped up its war in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 53,000 people have now been killed since the fighting began, including more than 500 in the last week alone.",
      "Families of the hostages \u2014 58 of whom are still believed to be held in Gaza, including about 20 thought by Israeli officials to be alive \u2014 have taken to the streets regularly, decrying the renewed offensive as putting their loved ones at even greater risk.",
      "\"Edan told us, so when they heard the bombing, it was very, very concerning, scary,\" said Adi. \"And at some point, one of the tunnels collapsed.\"",
      "\"He told us sometimes he was afraid to go to sleep. Because maybe they are going to bomb this place that he is specifically inside,\" added the father. \"It was very scary.\"",
      "Now back together as a family, their thoughts are still very much with the other hostages.",
      "\"We are still continuing to speak for all the 58 hostages that are still there,\" Yael told CBS News. \"Whatever Edan told me about hostages [who were] with him, you know, during any time of the captivity, I'm calling their moms and dads, and I'm telling them from the hospital \u2014 I've done it already \u2014 and I am telling them whatever Edan told me. You know, to give them a little bit hope that their story could end also soon, and with a good ending.\"",
      "She knows better than most how much power that hope can provide.",
      "\"It's very important, you know. For me, every hostage that got released, it was like, 'Oh my God, maybe he saw Edan. Maybe he can tell me something, and I don't care if it's not from two days, you know. Maybe a year ago he was with Edan, but still, to hear something about my boy, you know, it was very crucial to us.\"",
      "At least one of those previously released hostages came to visit Edan in the hospital last week. Fellow U.S.-Israeli dual national Sagui Dekel-Chen, who was released after 498 days in captivity, said in a statement released Monday by the Hostage Families Forum that he and Edan were together for a while in captivity.",
      "\"Our fates became intertwined in the most complex situation one could imagine,\" Dekel-Chen said in the statement. \"It was important for me to come and welcome Edan upon his return. I know what he went through and what he still has ahead of him. I am very happy for him and his family. I hope that soon I will be able to embrace all the other hostages who remain behind as well.\"",
      "Yael Alexander said \"it was unbelievable to see\" the two men reunited in freedom. \"It was a miracle. This is the victory \u2014 to see the hostages together.\"",
      "\u00adAsked what their family wanted the world to know now, as rumors swirl once again of potential progress in ceasefire talks despite the ramped-up Israeli military operations, Adi said the message was simple: Act now.",
      "\"The urgency,\" he told CBS News. \"Just the urgency. Our son, he was lucky to get out \u2026 Listen, you can't treat agony with more agony. This war needs to end.\"",
      "For the time being, however, there is no end in sight. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Monday that Israel intends to keep pushing its offensive in Gaza, to seize complete control of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"We're grateful for Steve [Witkoff], for President Trump, and for Adam Boehler,\" said the relieved father. \"Great job. But the job is not done. We still have more to do.\"",

      "The flight on Feb. 17, 2024, from Frankfurt, Germany, to Seville, Spain \u2014 an Airbus A321 carrying 199 passengers and six crew members \u2014  was over the Iberian Peninsula when the captain left the flight deck to go to the bathroom. Shortly afterward, the 38-year-old co-pilot \"suffered a sudden and severe incapacitation,\" a report from the Ministry of Transport said.",

      "When the captain was finished in the bathroom, he could not get back into the cockpit, according to the report. The door to the cockpit can only be opened from the inside, so to get back in, the captain would have to enter a code that would then alert the person inside the cockpit to open the door for them.",
      "The captain entered the code several times but still couldn't get into the flight deck. When a crew member tried to contact the co-pilot from the intercom, there was no response. The captain then used the emergency code \u2014 which would have unlocked the door after a short delay \u2014  to try to get into the flight deck, but before the delay expired, the co-pilot opened the door from the inside to let him in.",
      "The captain noticed the co-pilot was \"pale, sweating and moving strangely,\" according to the report, so he was given first aid by a crew member and a doctor who happened to be traveling on the flight as a passenger. That doctor diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, the report said.",
      "The investigation into the incident concluded the co-pilot's incapacitation was \"the symptom of a neurological condition that had not been detected either by the affected person himself or in the previous aeronautical medical examinations.\"",

      "While the co-pilot was incapacitated, he inadvertently hit several switches in the cockpit, including increasing pressure on one of the foot pedals, according to the report. This caused a 2-degree roll and a 5-degree heading change, both of which were fixed by the plane's autopilot, which remained on the whole time.",
      "About two minutes elapsed from the time the captain first tried to get back into the cockpit to when the door was finally opened, according to the report.",
      "The captain diverted the plane to the nearest airport, which was Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid Barajas Airport, where the flight landed safely about 20 minutes later. The co-pilot did not return to the cockpit for the rest of the flight.",
      "The co-pilot's condition would not have been found during medical screenings unless he was actively experiencing symptoms at the time or had previously experienced them, the report said.

      "The ministry said that many of the 65,935\u00a0Airbnb listings it had ordered to be withdrawn did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. Others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had, it said.",
      "Spain is grappling with a housing affordability crisis that has spurred government action against short-term rental companies. In recent months, tens of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets protesting rising housing and rental costs, which many say have been driven up by holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb that have proliferated in cities like Madrid and Barcelona and many other popular tourist destinations.",

    "story": [
      "A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023, researchers said Monday.",
      "\"This was very much a shocking finding,\" said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \"We've not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-sized monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "Goldsborough initially found four different howler infants being carried. In nearly all cases, the culprit was the same subadult male. The scientists nicknamed the capuchin Joker because the small scar at the side of its mouth reminded them of the \"Batman\" villain.",
      "At first, the scientists thought this was the \"heartwarming story of a weird capuchin adopting these infants,\" Goldsborough said.",
      "Then the researchers started finding other cases not involving Joker. The scientists were puzzled because the capuchins did not eat or prey on the babies, nor did they seem to enjoy playing with them.",
      "Goldsborough said they eventually realized these abductions were a social tradition or \"fad\" among the island's young male capuchins.",
      "Grim fate for abducted babies",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\"Our window into this story is constrained,\" said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video \u2014 from a few weeks to a few months in age \u2014 were too young to be weaned.",
      "\"A hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don't know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals \u2014 from gorillas to orcas \u2014 have been observed carrying their dead offspring, though scientists aren't sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren't eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\"We've all spent hours wracking our brains \u2014 why they would do this?\" said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \"caring motivation,\" or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \"remarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\" said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Cultural fads spreading among animals is rare but not unheard of.",
      "Barrett has previously studied capuchins in Costa Rica that suddenly started grooming porcupines, before growing bored of the trend.",
      "And back in the 1980s, killer whales took to donning dead salmon on their heads off the northwestern U.S. coast. This trend returned decades later when orcas were again spotted wearing these \"salmon hats\" last year.",

      "The remains of a Connecticut woman who went missing on a hike in Japan two years ago have been recovered, her family announced.",
      "Pattie Wu-Murad disappeared in April 2023 during a solo hiking trip in central Japan. Despite an extensive search around the Kumano Kodo Trail, which included American and Japanese search and rescue teams, the U.S. Embassy and the FBI, no trace of her was found.",
      "In September 2024, more than a year and a half after her disappearance, a fisherman found Wu-Murad's backpack and one hiking shoe near a stream on a different trail from where her family originally believed she was hiking, the family said. Japanese officials launched another search in that area, but no further evidence was found.",
      "Earlier this year, a member of the original U.S. search team who was in Japan in April, retraced the area where Wu-Murad's backpack was found and discovered several other of her personal items and what appeared to be a femur, her family said in a post on social media.",
      "Update on Pattie:\n\nOn Friday, May 9, 2025, our family received confirmation that our beloved wife, mother, sister,...",
      "On May 9, the family was told that DNA testing using a sample from Wu-Murad's daughter confirmed the remains were a match.",
      "\"Although we had tried to prepare ourselves for this outcome, the finality of this news is heartbreaking,\" her family said in a Facebook post. \"It offers a measure of closure, but many questions remain unanswered, including the exact circumstances and cause of Pattie's death. We now begin the process of working through international protocols to bring her remains home.\"",
      "Wu-Murad's family said they hope more evidence will be found to shed light on what happened.",
      "\"There'll be more people on that trail over the coming months and years, and maybe they'll come across more evidence,\" her husband, Kirk Murad,\u00a0told NBC Connecticut.",
      "The family expressed their gratitude for the search teams, volunteers and outpouring of support they received over the past two years.",
      "\"Pattie was an incredible woman whose love and friendship touched many lives,\" they said. \"While we are devastated, we are also humbled by the global community that rallied to help find her. We will continue to honor her memory with love and gratitude in our hearts.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 Pope Leo XIV and Vice President JD Vance met at the Vatican on Monday ahead of a flurry of U.S.-led diplomatic efforts aimed at making progress on a ceasefire in Russia's war in Ukraine. Vance, a Catholic convert, had led the U.S. delegation to the formal Mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. Joining him at the meeting on Monday was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic, Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder said.",
      "\"There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,\" according to a Vatican statement after their meeting.",
      "There was also a customary exchange of gifts, with Vance presenting the Chicago-born pontiff a Bears jersey bearing the name \"Pope Leo\" and number \"XIV.\" The pope is also a White Sox fan, his brother confirmed earlier this month.",
      "Vance's office said he also gave the pope two books by St. Augustine, \"The City of God\" and \"On \"Christian Doctrine.\" The vice president's office noted that Vance chose St. Augustine as his patron saint when he converted to Catholicism and was baptized in 2019. Pope Leo had previously been head of the Augustinian order worldwide.",
      "The Vatican listed Vance's delegation as the first of several private audiences Leo was having Monday with people who had come to Rome for his inaugural Mass, including other Christian leaders and a group of faithful from his old diocese in Chiclayo, Peru.",
      "The Vatican, which was largely sidelined during the first three years of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has offered to host any peace talks while continuing humanitarian efforts to facilitate prisoner swaps and reunite Ukrainian children taken by Russia.",
      "After greeting Leo briefly at the end of Sunday's Mass, Vance spent the rest of the day in separate meetings, including with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also met with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni, who said she hoped the trialateral meeting could be a \"new beginning.\"",
      "In the evening, Meloni spoke by phone with President Trump and several other European leaders ahead of Mr. Trump's expected call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Monday, according to a statement from Meloni's office.",
      "Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is a Chicago-born Augustinian missionary who spent the bulk of his ministry in Chiclayo, a commercial city of around 800,000 on Peru's northern Pacific coast.",
      "In the days since his May 8 election, Leo has vowed \"every effort\" to help bring peace to Ukraine. He also has emphasized his continuity with Pope Francis, who made caring for migrants and the poor a priority of his pontificate.",
      "Before his election, Prevost shared news articles on X that were critical of the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations of migrants.",
      "Vance was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the Argentine pope's April 21 death. The two had tangled over migration, with Francis publicly rebuking the Trump administration's deportation plan and correcting Vance's theological justification for it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For the leaders of Syria's transitional government, President Trump's announcement earlier this week that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country came as a relief after months of intense lobbying for a reprieve.",
      "\"I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,\" Mr. Trump said at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday.",
      "But inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy, the announcement came as a surprise to senior officials, sources tell CBS News.",
      "The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.",
      "Now, there are discussions inside Treasury to determine the speed and extent to which the decades-old sanctions \u2014 which restrict economic activity within Syria and its dealings with other countries \u2014 can be rolled back.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said Friday, \"President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief and the Treasury Department is in lockstep to execute his historic vision to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was traveling with the president, was aware of the announcement and part of the decision-making process.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that he was with Mr. Trump when he decided to include the announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria in his speech in Riyadh. Rubio did not say when the president made the decision.",
      "\"This is something that had been discussed, worked on, options considered for many weeks leading up to this announcement and that we are going to be implementing what the president has announced as an administration,\" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.",
      "Indeed, Syria's transitional government \u2014 led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa \u2014 has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months.",
      "The new government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion.",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration led an international effort to isolate Syria \u2014 culminating in multiple rounds of sanctions \u2014 as Assad's army fought a bloody civil war against rebel forces that led to half a million dead Syrians.",

      "\"Sometimes they decide to do more than one therapy,\" Siegel said. \"They might try to take the prostate out, do radiation and the hormone therapy altogether. That's not uncommon.\"",
      "There are two types of medications used to treat this type of advanced prostate cancer \u2014\u00a0Lupron, which stops testosterone production, and\u00a0Casodex, which stops testosterone from binding.

      "Second of all, it\u2019s possible the Rules Committee meeting could consume the entire calendar day of Wednesday. Streams of lawmakers from both sides will file into the Rules Committee to propose various amendments. This is a protracted process.",
      "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Sunday, May 18, 2025. (Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "But by the same token, meeting at 1 a.m. ET could diminish attendance. After all, who wants to show up at 1 a.m. ET for a meeting and maybe discuss your amendment at 6:30 a.m. ET? You get the idea.",
      "And once the bill gets out of the Rules Committee, expect late night meetings among Republicans as they try to close the deal. It\u2019s possible the House could vote at virtually any time of day Wednesday, Thursday or Friday to pass the bill. That could be late in the evening. Or even overnight. They will vote when the bill is ready, regardless of the time on the clock.",
      "Such is the lot drawn this week by House Republicans for the \"big, beautiful bill.\" Maybe they\u2019ll have the votes. Maybe they won\u2019t. Maybe they\u2019ll pass more spending cuts. Maybe there\u2019ll be a deal on SALT for state and local taxes. Maybe not. Maybe the vote comes at 3 in the afternoon. But more likely, sometime late at night.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "This wearable eVTOL isn't just a cool gadget. Zhiyuan sees it as being useful in all kinds of real-world situations. It could help with emergency rescues, maintaining electrical infrastructure or cleaning skyscrapers. It also has the potential for sightseeing and leisure flights, and it could be used for border patrol or customs inspections. With its versatility and easy controls, this aircraft could be a game changer for both professionals and adventure seekers.",

The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies.

      "Here are 14 essential protective measures to shield yourself from check washing scams.",
      "1. Use a black gel pen: When writing checks, always use a\u00a0black gel pen. The ink is much harder to remove compared to regular ballpoint pen ink.",
      "2. Bring checks directly to the post office when mailing them: If using a mailbox, make sure to drop off your mail before the final scheduled pickup so it is not left sitting overnight.",
      "3. Sign up for USPS Informed Delivery: Stay ahead by signing up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery. You will receive digital previews of incoming mail so you can monitor for any missing items early. Learn more about why it's important\u00a0here.",
      "4. Monitor your bank accounts: Set up real-time alerts for check clearing and review your statements weekly to catch any suspicious activity. Also, ask your bank about any other fraud-prevention tools they offer to protect your accounts.",
      "5. Switch to digital payments when possible: Use your bank\u2019s mobile app to deposit checks without mailing or physically delivering them, reducing the risk of theft or tampering.",
      "6. Use checks with built-in security features: Choose checks printed on paper with watermarks, chemical-sensitive coatings or other security features that make check washing much harder.",
      "7. Limit the information on checks: Avoid unnecessary personal details. Do not print your Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number or phone number on your checks. The less information available, the less a fraudster can use.",
      "HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS",
      "8. Store checks securely: Keep blank checks in a safe place. Store your checkbook in a locked drawer or safe, not in your purse, car or an easily accessible location at home.",
      "9. Check your mailbox security: Install a\u00a0locking mailbox. If possible, use a mailbox with a lock to prevent thieves from stealing outgoing or incoming mail.",
      "10. Be cautious with endorsements: When endorsing checks, write \"For Deposit Only\" along with your account number to prevent others from cashing the check.",
      "11. Enroll in identity theft protection with check fraud specialization: Choose services that specifically monitor for compromised check details on dark web marketplaces and alert you to suspicious check-cashing patterns. Identity theft protection services monitor your personal data across the dark web and public databases, alert you to suspicious activity and assist you in locking down your accounts if needed.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "12. Invest in personal data removal services: Minimize exposure of sensitive details (like addresses or banking affiliations) that fraudsters could exploit for check-washing scams. Removing your personal information from these sites can help reduce your risk of becoming a victim. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed. You usually need to sign up through your bank, and there might be a fee, but it\u2019s a smart way to protect your business from check fraud, especially if you write a lot of checks.",

      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

      "1. Add more RAM: If your system has 4GB or less, upgrading to 8 GB+ can significantly improve multitasking and responsiveness, especially with Linux.

For instance,\u00a0Google Drive offers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, while\u00a0Dropbox\u00a0provides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.\u00a0OneDrive provides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite.",
      "Additionally, cloud storage services come with features like automatic syncing and backup, making it easier to organize and safeguard your files. This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer. With features like file versioning and collaboration tools, cloud platforms offer more than just storage \u00a0\u2014 they enhance productivity and allow seamless file sharing with friends, family or colleagues.",
      "Finally, many cloud storage providers offer encryption and other security measures to protect your files for added peace of mind. However, it would be best always to take extra precautions, such as enabling two-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords, to ensure your data is safe.\u00a0Kurt\u2019s favorite cloud services can be seen here.",
      "Protect your data: Essential security steps after managing storage",
      "After you've freed up space on your PC-whether by deleting old files, moving data to an external drive or leveraging cloud storage, it's just as important to make sure your valuable information stays secure. The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss.",
      "1. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable encryption:\u00a0Encrypt your external hard drives and cloud storage accounts to add an extra layer of protection to your data.",
      "3. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts that offer this feature, especially for cloud storage services.",
      "4.\u00a0Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and software\u00a0up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Backup your data regularly: Create\u00a0multiple backups of your important files, including at least one offline copy.",
      "8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods or\u00a0password-protected links.",
      "By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your data and protect yourself from potential cyber threats.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Your PC\u2019s storage can fill up fast, but you can always free up some space. I personally prefer storing images and videos that take up too much space on an external drive. This way, I can access them whenever I need to while keeping my PC storage free. If an external drive feels like too much of a hassle, you can always opt for cloud storage. Windows supports a range of cloud storage options, including its own services like OneDrive.",

      "Marketing data brokers focus more on your browsing habits, past purchases and interests. They are responsible for \"personalized marketing\" as well as helping other companies target you with those surprisingly relevant ads you see online.",
      "Recruitment data brokers collect and process personal information to offer background screening services to organizations evaluating job candidates or performing background checks before making an offer. Unfortunately, although illegal, there is nothing actually stopping unscrupulous employers from using the much less regulated and reliable people search sites for the same purposes.",
      "Risk mitigation brokers aggregate a variety of background, criminal, property and other information to provide assessment reports to various investment and business companies. The information they collect is aimed at helping such companies manage risk in taking on new business.",

      "Health information data brokers collect information about your general health and sell it to companies in healthcare and related fields. This information can be used to target you with health product ads and even set your insurance premiums.",
      "Hackers are most likely to use people search sites, though; they are easily accessible, eminently searchable, relatively cheap (with trial offers for as little as a dollar) and do not ask any questions. Other data brokers may also sell personal information to hackers, but they tend to sell profiles in bulk.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.

      "It is easy to feel overwhelmed when you realize just how much of your personal information is out there, and how many different players are collecting, selling and using it. But knowing how data brokers operate is the first step to taking back control. Whether it is people search sites or the less visible brokers working behind the scenes, your data is valuable, and you deserve to know who has it and what they are doing with it. The good news is, there are tools and services out there that can help you clean up your digital footprint and protect your privacy. So, do not just sit back and hope for the best \u2014 take action and make your data work for you, not against you.",

      "Fake PayPal scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this scam works",
      "This type of scam is known as a remote access scam. It often begins with a fake email that appears to come from a trusted company like PayPal. The message claims there is an issue, such as an unauthorized charge, and urges the victim to call a phone number or click a link.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the scammer makes contact, they guide the victim to enter a code into their browser or install a program, claiming it will fix the problem. In reality, this grants the scammer full control of the victim\u2019s computer.",
      "Once inside, scammers often search for sensitive files, access banking websites, steal login credentials or install malware to maintain long-term access. Even if the immediate scam is stopped, hidden malware can allow scammers to reenter the system later.",

      "Fake emails are harder to spot than ever: Scammers create emails that look almost identical to real ones from trusted companies like PayPal. They copy logos, formatting and even fake customer support numbers. Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and verify communications by visiting the official website or app directly instead of clicking links inside emails.",
      "Remote access scams can escalate fast: Once scammers gain control of your device, they can steal sensitive data, move funds between accounts and install hidden malware that stays behind even after the scammer disconnects. It often takes only minutes for serious damage to be done, making fast recognition critical.",
      "Psychological pressure plays a big role: Scammers rely on creating a sense of urgency and fear. By keeping you on the phone and urging secrecy, they isolate you from help and rush you into making bad decisions. Recognizing when you are being pressured is key to breaking the scammer\u2019s control.",
      "Fast action can make all the difference: By quickly disconnecting his computer and contacting his bank, John limited the scammer\u2019s access to his accounts. Acting within minutes rather than hours can stop further theft, block fraudulent transactions and protect your sensitive information from being fully compromised.",

      "Taking simple but strong security steps can protect you from falling victim.",
      "1. Never call a number listed in a suspicious email: Scammers often set up fake phone numbers that sound professional but are designed to manipulate you into handing over control or information. Always find verified contact information through a company's official website or app, not links/numbers provided in suspicious messages.",
      "2. Be skeptical of unusual instructions: No legitimate company will ask you to install software or enter strange codes to protect your account. If anything seems unusual, trust your instincts and stop the communication immediately.",
      "3. Install strong antivirus software on all devices:\u00a0Antivirus programs can detect suspicious downloads, block remote access attempts and help prevent hackers from taking over your system. Having strong antivirus protection installed across all your devices is the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and attempt to access your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use identity theft protection: These services monitor financial accounts, credit reports and online activity for signs of fraud, alerting you to suspicious transactions.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. React immediately if you suspect a scam: Disconnect your device from the internet, contact your bank or credit card company immediately and change your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts. Monitor your accounts closely for unauthorized activity and report the scam to the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission as well as the company that was impersonated. Acting quickly can prevent further access and limit the damage scammers can cause.",
      "6. Use multifactor authentication (MFA):\u00a0MFA adds a critical layer of security beyond passwords, blocking unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen. Enable MFA on all accounts, especially banking, email and payment platforms, to stop scammers from bypassing stolen passwords.",
      "7. Update devices and software immediately:\u00a0Regular updates patch security flaws that scammers exploit to install malware or hijack systems. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible to ensure you\u2019re always protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "8. Employ a password manager with strong, unique passwords: Avoid password reuse and use complex passphrases to minimize credential-stuffing attacks. A\u00a0password manager generates and stores uncrackable passwords, eliminating the risk of weak or repeated credentials. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "9. Never share screen access or grant remote control: Scammers exploit screen-sharing tools to steal passwords and manipulate transactions in real time. Legitimate tech support will never demand unsolicited screen access; terminate the call immediately if pressured.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0These services automate requests to delete your personal information from data brokers and people-search sites, reducing publicly available details scammers could exploit for phishing or impersonation. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TECH SUPPORT SCAMS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "John\u2019s story is a reminder that online scams are evolving quickly and becoming more aggressive. Staying skeptical, verifying all suspicious messages and acting quickly if something feels wrong can make the difference between staying safe and losing sensitive information.

      "An Indiana man convicted in the fatal shooting of a police officer in 2000 was executed Tuesday by lethal injection in the state\u2019s second execution in 15 years.",
      "Benjamin Ritchie, 45, had been on Indiana\u2019s death row since 2002, when he was convicted of killing Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a chase on foot.",
      "Ritchie was executed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Indiana Department of Correction officials. IDOC said in a statement that the process started shortly after midnight and Ritchie was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m.",
      "CONVICTED COP KILLER WILL BECOME 2ND EXECUTION IN INDIANA SINCE 2009",
      "Ritchie's last meal was from Olive Garden, and he expressed love, support and peace for his friends and family, according to the statement.",
      "Under state law, he was allowed five witnesses at his execution, which included his attorney, Steve Schutte, who told reporters he had a limited view of the process.",
      "\"I couldn't see his face. He was lying flat by that time,\" Schutte said. \"He sat up, twitched, laid back down.\"",

      "The process was carried out hours after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case, exhausting all of Ritchie\u2019s legal options to fight the death sentence.",
      "Dozens of people, both anti-death penalty advocates and supporters of Toney, stood outside the prison until early Tuesday.",
      "Indiana resumed executions in December after a yearslong hiatus due to a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide. Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber before Joseph Corcoran\u2019s execution, showing a space that looks like an operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting and an adjacent viewing room. They've since offered few other details.",

      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century.",
      "The Associated Press and other media organizations filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana seeking media access, but a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction last week that would have allowed journalists to witness Ritchie\u2019s execution and future ones. The judge found that barring the news media doesn\u2019t violate the First Amendment nor does it single out the news media for unequal treatment.",

      "Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. The married father of two was the first officer of the small department to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty.",
      "Relatives spoke at a clemency hearing last week in support of the execution.",
      "\"It\u2019s time. We\u2019re all tired,\" said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney\u2019s wife. \"It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It\u2019s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill\u2019s life, and not his death.\"",

      "\"This is a foolish, senseless, agonizing waste of time and money,\" said Schutte, who added that Ritchie was no longer \"the same person who committed that crime.\"",
      "Attorney General Todd Rokita said the execution honored Toney\u2019s \"sacrifice to the community.\"",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie\u2019s clemency bid last week without explanation.",

      "\"It actually pretty much did the opposite with so many because the system was broken, the policies and practices were broken, where children were being placed [with] sponsors that were unvetted or improperly vetted or may have been illegal aliens themselves or smugglers or criminals,\" Clem, who was based out of Yuma, Arizona, during the Biden administration, told Fox News Digital. \"So, my role was to go in there with my 27-plus years of Border Patrol experience, and having dealt with this firsthand in the field for years, to rebuild and put\u2026 commonsense practices and policies in place.

      "\"The missed opportunity here is enormous,\" he said. \"There were two major levers Israel had \u2014 Israeli consent to U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia and American consent to lifting sanctions on Syria.

      "The sense of urgency grew last week when Trump abruptly paused U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed Houthis just days after a missile landed near Ben Gurion Airport.

We need to ask, \u2018What depends on us? What needs to change?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re doing that.\"",
      "The sharpest potential rift remains Iran. Jerusalem views a nuclear-armed Tehran as an existential threat. Haiman calls this \"a historic window\" to stop it, by force if needed. \"The American interest is to finish wars, not enter them, and to seal a deal better than Obama\u2019s,\" he said, warning that a diplomatic track pursued over Israel\u2019s head could soon limit Israeli military options.",

      "\"You had the audacity, in your capacity as a senior U.N. official, to stand before the Security Council and invoke the charge of genocide without evidence, mandate, or restraint,\" Danon wrote in his response. \"As a senior representative of the United Nations, you are obligated to refrain from prejudging complex international matters.

      "The Israeli ambassador concluded his letter by turning the questions around on Fletcher, telling the OCHA chief to ask himself whether he had done enough to prevent Oct. 7, accelerate the release of the hostages and hold Hamas accountable.",
      "Kaneko told Fox News Digital that \"Mr. Fletcher has repeatedly and publicly spoken out against what he calls the horrendous Hamas-led attacks and called for the release of the hostages. Mr. Fletcher was deeply moved by his visit in February to the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where one in four people were killed or taken hostage.\"",
      "Later on Friday, Fletcher issued his own letter in response to Danon in which he recalled meeting with Oct. 7 survivors from kibbutz Nir Oz, where the Bibas family was taken. He also demanded that the Israeli government \"let us do our work.\"",
      "Fletcher also said that while he was not in his position when the Hamas massacre took place, he watched the \"atrocities\" unfold \"with horror.\" The U.N. official added that he has repeatedly called on Hamas to release hostages unconditionally, including during the session in which he accused Israel of committing genocide.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in May 2020 gave momentum to a cross-ideological effort to reform the legal defense known as \"qualified immunity,\" which can protect cops even when they have violated the Constitution.",
      "Bills were introduced in Congress calling to abolish the defense.",
      "Multiple cases piled up at the Supreme Court urging the justices to intervene.",
      "Much ink was spilled.",
      "And then, nothing happened.",
      "With the fifth anniversary of Floyd's death approaching this weekend, Congress still has not passed any legislation seeking to even reform, let alone abolish, qualified immunity. The Supreme Court has rejected dozens of cases asking it to do the same.",
      "What minor changes have occurred, via court rulings or state legislative actions, have had little practical impact on a nationwide basis.",
      "For Karen Blum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and a long-term critic of qualified immunity, the situation is nothing short of depressing.",
      "\"After George Floyd, it was the first time I was actually optimistic and very positive that something would be done, no matter how little,\" she said. \"But nothing, I mean nothing, has happened.\"",
      "The doctrine, first adopted by the Supreme Court in 1967, gives government officials the benefit of the doubt when they violate the Constitution.",

If qualified immunity is granted, the lawsuit is dismissed and the plaintiffs never get a chance to either negotiate a settlement or go to trial.",
      "In 2020, a Reuters investigation found that judges were increasingly granting qualified immunity at the direction of the Supreme Court.",
      "The law enforcement community strongly defends the concept, saying it is needed to give officers acting in good faith the confidence to make split-second decisions, often in extremely dangerous circumstances.",

      "Egregious cases",
      "Floyd's killing by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, triggered an immediate national debate over police violence, especially against Black men.",
      "But there had already been a quiet cross-ideological effort before then to reform qualified immunity, backed by such strange bedfellows as the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute. They had filed briefs at the Supreme Court hoping to persuade the justices to take a new look at the doctrine and consider amending it \u2014 or maybe ditching it altogether.",
      "For a few weeks in the summer of 2020, as racial justice protests raged, both the Supreme Court and Congress considered whether to take action.",
      "The court quickly sidestepped the issue, declining in June 2020 to hear a series of cases asking for reconsideration of qualified immunity.",
      "Ten days later, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, including a number of police reform measures on qualified immunity and other issues. But it ran into headwinds in the Republican-controlled Senate and lost momentum.",
      "\"Republican intransigence was the real explanation there, and I don\u2019t see any reason to think that has changed for the better,\" said Clark Neily, a lawyer at the Cato Institute.",

      "Prison officers at a facility in Columbia, South Carolina, failed to intervene when two men murdered four of their fellow inmates.",
      "However, there have been small signs of incremental change.",
      "Some judges have criticized the way qualified immunity has been applied, joining a handful who had done the same before 2020. That approach has seeped into some recent rulings, those following the case law say.",
      "Chris Balch, a lawyer in Georgia who represents police departments in such cases, said the thumb on the scale in favor of officers \"has lessened in the last five years,\" meaning defense lawyers need to be ready to go to trial.",
      "He cited a January 2024 ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that denied qualified immunity to a jail intake officer after a Black inmate who had disclosed he stabbed a white man for racially motivated reasons then murdered his white cellmate.",
      "There was also a glimmer of hope for reform advocates at the Supreme Court, which in November 2020 ruled in favor of a Texas prison inmate who had been held in filthy conditions. The justices overturned a lower court that said qualified immunity protected prison officials.",
      "After reform efforts failed in Congress, there was briefly a concerted effort to enact state-level legislation that would create an alternative way to sue officers under those states' laws, making qualified immunity unavailable as a defense. Although a handful of states enacted such laws, the campaign met with considerable resistance elsewhere.",
      "More recently, President Donald Trump's re-election has in some ways sent the pendulum swinging in the other direction in the national political arena.",
      "When Trump signed a pro-law enforcement executive order last month, he stressed the importance of ensuring officers are not held legally accountable for their actions.",
      "The order says the Trump administration will take action to \u201cprovide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities\u201d and calls on officials to \u201cstrengthen and expand legal protections\u201d for officers.",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said Trump's policing plan shows he is \"fulfilling his campaign promise to Make America Safe Again.\" The administration is committed to reversing \"failed policies\" backed by Democrats, he added.",
      "With that political environment in mind, Blum, the qualified immunity critic, remains pessimistic there will be any major change any time soon.",
      "\"Qualified immunity is here to stay,\" she said."

      "Brynn Carrigan\u2019s headaches started in April 2024. Within a couple of weeks, she was debilitated.",
      "Her vomiting exacerbated the excruciating pain in her skull. She spent nearly every hour in bed with the covers pulled over her head, blocking out any sliver of light. Even the clock on her microwave was too much.",
      "\u201cI went from training for a marathon, raising two teenagers and having a job to essentially being bedridden,\u201d said Carrigan, 41, of Bakersfield, California, who works for Kern County Public Health.",
      "Her condition continued to get worse and doctors couldn\u2019t provide answers \u2014 until her third visit to the hospital, when one doctor asked her if she\u2019d had any respiratory symptoms before the headaches started.",
      "She had. About a month before the headaches started, Carrigan had what she thought was a typical cold \u2014 though she recalled that her cough lingered a bit longer than normal and she went on to develop a rash on her thighs. Both symptoms got better without treatment.",
      "These turned out to be key pieces of information. A biopsy of her spinal fluid revealed that Carrigan had coccidioidal meningitis, a rare complication of a fungal infection called Valley fever.",
      "\u201cI knew something was wrong but never in a million years did I think it would be something so serious,\u201d Carrigan said.",
      "Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by inhaling coccidioides spores, a type of fungi endemic to the hot, dry climate of the southwestern United States. Climate change is creating drier soils that are inching farther east, expanding the range of the fungi. Valley fever is increasingly being diagnosed outside its usual territory and cases have been rising across the Western U.S. While Arizona still sees the highest number each year, California is closing the gap.",
      "From 2000 through 2016, California had 1,500 to 5,500 cases a year. From 2017 through 2023, those numbers jumped to 7,700 to 9,000 annual cases. Preliminary data for 2024 puts the count at more than 12,600 \u2014 the highest the state has ever seen and about 3,000 more cases than the previous record, in 2023.",
      "Early data shows California is on track for another record-breaking year. Already, the state has logged more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Valley fever statewide, more than there were at the same time last year and nearly double what cases were at this time in 2023.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that the number of cases of coccidioidomycosis is enormously higher than before,\u201d said Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of the division of infectious disease and director of the Valley Fever Institute at Kern Medical in California. \u201cIf you want to see me, right now you\u2019d have to wait until July, and that goes for my colleagues, too.\u201d",
      "Drought cycles driving spread",
      "Carrigan lives in Kern County, a dry, sprawling region that sits between two mountain ranges at the southern end of California\u2019s Central Valley.",
      "The county has already recorded at least 900 Valley fever cases so far this year and has been ground zero for the fungal infection in the state for the last three years.",
      "But the consistently high cases in places like Kern County are not driving the upward trend in California, said Gail Sondermeyer Cooksey, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Instead, new hot spots are emerging along the edges of the Central Valley \u2014 in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, along California\u2019s central coast. Cases in Contra Costa County, just east of Berkeley, have tripled so far this year compared with the same time in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt appears to be spreading out,\u201d Sondermeyer Cooksey said.",
      "Many factors likely influence how well coccidioides spores multiply and spread, \u201cbut one thing we have identified as a big driver of those peaks and dips is drought,\u201d she said.",
      "A 2022 study in The Lancet Planetary Health found that drought years suppress Valley fever cases, but multiple years of drought followed by a wet winter causes cases to rebound sharply. This shift in weather patterns, which is driven by climate change, appears to largely influence where new Valley fever hot spots emerge. Longer, drier summers can also shift transmission season, when the spores spread, from late summer and early winter to earlier in the year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing wetter wets and drier dries across the Southwest, but California is seeing that to a higher degree,\u201d said Jennifer Head, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who studies Valley fever and climate change.",
      "In Arizona, new hot spots are popping up in places in the state that have a climate more similar to California\u2019s than elsewhere in Arizona.",
      "\u201cThe highest increases in Arizona are in the northern plateau regions, which, similar to California, have historically been colder and wetter,\u201d Head said.",
      "Closely tracking Los Angeles",
      "The climate patterns expanding Valley fever\u2019s range in California are the same ones that drive increasingly intense wildfires. Scientists are still trying to understand how fires may worsen Valley fever risk, but some research has shown a link between wildfire smoke and higher rates of diagnoses.",
      "Sondermeyer Cooksey said the state health department warned first responders to January\u2019s devastating fires in Los Angeles County of the potentially increased risk of Valley fever in the area because of the fires. There have been past outbreaks among wildland firefighters.",
      "There\u2019s some limited evidence that wildfires may spread the coccidioides spores. In a 2023 study, researchers looked at 19 fires across California and observed higher rates of Valley fever following three of those fires. These fires tended to be larger, located near population centers and burned areas that had high Valley fever transmission prior to the fire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether there is a link between wildfires and Valley fever, but what is important to know is that coccidioides live in the dirt and anything that disturbs the dirt can exacerbate Valley fever,\u201d Sondermeyer Cooksey said. \u201cFires do that, then we have all of the reconstruction projects that also disturb soil.\u201d",
      "Peak Valley fever season hasn\u2019t happened yet this year. Because reconstruction efforts are disturbing soil in the burn scar, Sondermeyer Cooksey said state and local public health departments \u201care closely tracking the numbers\u201d in areas hit by January\u2019s fires.",
      "Cases after Lightning in a Bottle festival",
      "Diagnosing Valley fever is tricky, mostly because its symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses including flu, Covid and pneumonia. If someone experiences those symptoms, it\u2019s important for them to let their doctor know if they\u2019ve been around disturbed soil or dust \u2014 in a construction zone, camping, hiking, working outside or at a festival \u2014 or in an area known to have Valley fever, Sondermeyer Cooksey said.",
      "Symptoms typically show up one to three weeks after exposure, but it can take as long as eight weeks, so people may not make an immediate connection, Head, of the University of Michigan, said.",
      "Last year, at least 19 people who attended the Lightning in a Bottle music festival \u2014 which is being held in Kern County again this month \u2014 were diagnosed with Valley fever later in the summer. At least eight were hospitalized.",
      "\u201cLightning in a Bottle is right in the middle of the endemic region, that\u2019s one of the hot spots for the disease,\u201d said Dr. George Thompson, director of the Center for Valley Fever at the University of California, Davis, adding that the vast majority of people who attend will not get an infection, but people who aren\u2019t from an endemic area may be at higher risk.",
      "Thompson said it\u2019s clear that he and his colleagues across the state are treating more patients for the infection. Only about 1% of cases result in life-threatening meningitis or other complications, as Carrigan\u2019s did, but once a person is infected, they never clear the fungus from their body.",
      "\u201cThere is no drug that kills cocci, so what keeps you from being ill is your immune response,\u201d Johnson, of Kern Medical, said. To treat the infection, people are given antifungals \u201clong enough for a person\u2019s immune system to figure out how to control it. If you then do something to disrupt that immunity, it can start growing again, and that can surface years later,\u201d he said.",
      "Carrigan spent the last year on an intense regimen of anti-fungal treatments. During the first few months, she lost most of her hair and eyelashes and barely recognized herself in the mirror.",
      "She\u2019s now made a full recovery and even ran a marathon this spring, but she still takes anti-fungal medication. Carrigan said she wants more people to understand both the warning signs of Valley fever and the importance of telling their doctor if they\u2019ve been somewhere with cases, which could help people get a faster diagnosis.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s only 1% of cases, as we see cases increase, the number of people who experience complications is going to rise, too,\u201d she said."

      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "The shifting tone on Joe Biden\u2019s cancer diagnosis",
      "In the day after former President Joe Biden announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, Republicans\u2019 reactions have shifted from sympathy to an onslaught of accusations that his inner circle masked his condition while he was in office.",
      "Among the more prominent voices was President Donald Trump, who on Sunday wished Biden a speedy recovery. And then yesterday, Trump posted on social media: \u201cEveryone was in on the coverup! Who was running the country? We need accountability!\u201d",
      "The assertion from Trump and others, including Vice President JD Vance, comes as fresh reporting suggests Biden\u2019s decline was more pronounced than previously known. Now, the cancer diagnosis \u2014coupled with the damage to Biden world\u2019s credibility when it comes to his fitness \u2014 are tinder for unfounded speculation that Biden, 82, knew he was sick and concealed it anyway.",
      "Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin called the timing of Biden\u2019s announcement \u201cinteresting.\u201d On the other side of the aisle, former Rep. Dean Phillips, who ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, also suggested Biden held off in revealing his diagnosis for strategic reasons.",
      "Given the care and attention Biden received as president, the advanced state of the illness left some medical experts surprised. According to multiple oncologists, most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed at an early stage. But in around 8% of cases, the cancer has already metastasized by the time it\u2019s diagnosed \u2014 and at that point, the patient has most likely had prostate cancer for several years to a decade.\u00a0However, there are some exceptions.",

      "\u201cA sane country does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a pastime, and does not engage in mass population displacement,\u201d Yair Golan, a left-wing opposition voice and the former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army, said in a charged interview with local radio station Reshet Bet.",
      "Comparing Israel's actions to those of South Africa\u2019s during the decades of apartheid, the leader of the small Democrats party and longtime critic of Netanyahu, added, \u201cThe Jewish people, who have endured persecution, pogroms, and genocides throughout our history .. are the ones now taking actions that are utterly unconscionable.\u201d",
      "Golan\u2019s words drew swift condemnation, with Netanyahu calling them an \u201coutrageous incitement against our heroic soldiers and against the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "Israeli defense minister Israel Katz called the comments \u201cvile blood libel against our regular and reserve soldiers,\u201d while the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Golan \u201cknowingly spreads lies, defames Israel and the IDF in the eyes of the world.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Golan \"a brave, direct man,\" adding that his comments referred to Israel's political leaders, not soldiers.",

      "Benjamin Ritchie, 45, had been on Indiana\u2019s death row since 2002, when he was convicted of killing Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney during a chase on foot.",
      "Ritchie was executed at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Indiana Department of Corrections officials. IDOC said in a statement that the process started shortly after midnight and Ritchie was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m.",
      "Ritchie\u2019s last meal was from the Olive Garden and he expressed love, support and peace for his friends and family, according to the statement.",
      "Under state law, he was allowed five witnesses at his execution, which included his attorney Steve Schutte, who told reporters he had a limited view of the process.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see his face. He was lying flat by that time,\u201d Schutte said. \u201cHe sat up, twitched, laid back down.\u201d",
      "The process was carried out hours after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case, exhausting all of Ritchie\u2019s legal options to fight the death sentence.",
      "Dozens of people, both anti-death penalty advocates and supporters of Toney, stood outside the prison until early Tuesday.",
      "Indiana resumed\u00a0executions\u00a0in December after a yearslong hiatus due to a scarcity of lethal injection drugs nationwide. Prison officials provided photos of the execution chamber before\u00a0Joseph Corcoran\u2019s execution, showing a space that looks like an operating room with a gurney, fluorescent lighting and an adjacent viewing room. They\u2019ve since offered few other details.",
      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws,\u00a0Indiana is one of two\u00a0that bars media witnesses. The other, Wyoming, has conducted one execution in the last half-century.",
      "The Associated Press and other media organizations\u00a0filed a federal lawsuit\u00a0in Indiana seeking media access, but a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction last week that would have allowed journalists to witness Ritchie\u2019s execution and future ones. The judge found that barring the news media doesn\u2019t violate the First Amendment nor does it single out the news media for unequal treatment.",
      "The execution in Indiana is\u00a0among 12 scheduled in eight states\u00a0this year. Ritchie\u2019s execution and two others in Texas and Tennessee will be carried out this week.",
      "The 2000 fatal shooting of a police officer",
      "Ritchie was 20 when he and others stole a van in Beech Grove, near Indianapolis. He then fired at Toney during a foot chase, killing him.",
      "At the time Ritchie was on probation from a 1998 burglary conviction.",
      "Toney, 31, had worked at the Beech Grove Police Department for two years. The married father of two was the first officer of the small department to be killed by gunfire in the line of duty.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time. We\u2019re all tired,\u201d said Dee Dee Horen, who was Toney\u2019s wife. \u201cIt is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It\u2019s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill\u2019s life, and not his death.\u201d",
      "Appealing a death sentence",
      "Ritchie\u2019s attorneys have fought the death sentence, arguing his legal counsel at trial was ineffective because his lawyers failed to fully investigate and present evidence on his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure.",
      "Current defense attorneys say Ritchie suffered \u201csevere brain damage\u201d because his mother abused alcohol and drugs during pregnancy and he\u2019s struggled with decision-making. He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005.",
      "Disability rights advocates argued that Ritchie\u2019s brain damage should have excluded him from the death penalty.",
      "\u201cThis is a foolish, senseless, agonizing waste of time and money,\u201d said Schutte, who added that Ritchie was no longer \u201cthe same person who committed that crime.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Todd Rokita said the execution honored Toney\u2019s \u201csacrifice to the community.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie\u2019s clemency bid last week without explanation.",
      "The Indiana Supreme Court denied a request to stop the execution. Ritchie\u2019s attorneys challenged that decision in federal court, which a judge rejected. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the lower court on Sunday.",
      "As the sun set Monday, the Rev. Richard Holy, a Catholic priest, recited the rosary with about 20 people in the prison parking lot.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to keep taking one life to exact justice for taking another,\u201d he said.",

      "Ritchie, who was also a father, spent his last days getting visits from friends and family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve ruined my life and other people\u2019s lives, and I\u2019m so sorry for that night,\u201d he told the parole board earlier this month. \u201cYou can\u2019t take back what you did.\u201d"

Now, the cancer diagnosis \u2014coupled with the damage to Biden world\u2019s credibility when it comes to his fitness \u2014 are tinder for unfounded speculation that Biden, 82, knew he was sick and concealed it anyway.",

Dean Phillips, who ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, also suggested Biden held off in revealing his diagnosis for strategic reasons.",
      "Given the care and attention Biden received as president, the advanced state of the illness left some medical experts surprised. According to multiple oncologists, most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed at an early stage. But in around 8% of cases, the cancer has already metastasized by the time it\u2019s diagnosed \u2014 and at that point, the patient has most likely had prostate cancer for several years to a decade.\u00a0However, there are some exceptions.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, when he is likely to face questions about many of the issues he did during last week's contentious congressional hearings.",
      "Tuesday's hearing centers on President Donald Trump's budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services, but Kennedy is likely to be asked about his vaccine skepticism and support of fluoride bans and the massive DOGE-led cuts to his department.",
      "The White House's proposal for HHS' 2026 budget would slash the department's discretionary funding by 26%, hitting offices like the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program the most. Under the proposed budget, the NIH's funds would be slashed by nearly $18 billion compared with fiscal year 2025 levels.",
      "Kennedy appeared before the House Appropriations and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committees last week, when he refused to answer questions about the safety and effectiveness of major types of vaccines.",
      "Asked at the House Appropriations Committee hearing last week whether he would vaccinate a child against measles today, Kennedy paused before he said, \"Probably for measles.\" Kennedy argued that his \"opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.\"",
      "\"I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me,\" said the top health official.",
      "Asked whether he would vaccinate his child against chickenpox and polio, Kennedy said he did not want to provide advice.",
      "Kennedy has a history of promoting false claims about vaccines, including the measles vaccine during an outbreak. The United States has had more than 1,000 reported measles cases so far this year, according to NBC News data. Kennedy has also promoted unproven treatments for measles and false information about vaccine testing.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician who chairs the HELP Committee, corrected some of Kennedy's comments about vaccines last week, describing how they were tested.",
      "HHS is slashing its workforce and reorganizing divisions and offices. It announced in a news release in March that it would cut its workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. The release also announced that the number of divisions and offices would be reduced, a move the department said was intended to \"streamline the functions of the Department.\""

      "A long-lost memorial bust of The Doors\u2019 legendary frontman Jim Morrison has been recovered 37 years after it was stolen, French police said.",
      "Crafted in 1981 by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Morrison\u2019s death, the bust was defaced with graffiti and messages by fans at gravesite in Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, which is also the final resting place of French singer Edith Piaf and the Irish author, poet and playwright, Oscar Wilde.",
      "Seven years later someone took it from the cemetery, which has become a pilgrimage for fans of Morrison, who was known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants and theatrical stage presence.",
      "The singer propelled The Doors to several major hits between 1965 and 1967, including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cHello I Love You,\u201d \u201cTouch Me\u201d and \u201cRiders on the Storm.\u201d",
      "Almost four decades on and the sculpture was found during an unrelated search, France's Financial and Anti-Corruption Brigade said in a statement on Instagram Friday.",
      "A representative for Morrison\u2019s estate told Rolling Stone that it were \u201chappy to hear the news\u201d of the statue\u2019s recovery. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a piece of history, and one Jim\u2019s family wanted there on his grave, so it\u2019s gratifying to see that it\u2019s been recovered.\u201d",
      "Born in 1943 in Melbourne, Florida, Morrison said he witnessed the aftermath of a terrible car accident on a Native American reservation as a child, an event that loomed large in his later lyrics and poetry.",
      "He founded The Doors with keyboardist Ray Manzarek in 1965, and guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band released their eponymous debut album \u201cThe Doors\u201d and \u201cStrange Days\u201d in 1967 and \u201cThe Soft Parade\u201d the following year. They followed this up with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in 1970.",
      "But the band would burn out quickly as Morrison sank into alcoholism. He was twice arrested for his on-stage antics, including a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity. He received a\u00a0posthumous pardon\u00a0in 2010.",
      "Morrison made his final album with The Doors, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d in 1971, and moved to Paris soon afterwards.",
      "There, on July 3, 1971, he was found dead in a bathtub. No autopsy was performed and accounts of what caused his death are disputed."

      "Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, the largest EV battery maker, traded as much as 18.4% above the listing price of 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.61), raising at least $4.6 billion. At a ceremony at the stock exchange in central Hong Kong, CATL\u2019s billionaire founder Robin Zeng marked the start of trading by banging a bronze \u201cmegagong\u201d reserved for only the biggest listings.",
      "The company, which makes batteries for Tesla and other automakers and has a tech licensing agreement with Ford, controls more than a third of the global market for EV batteries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the 800-pound gorilla in the battery space,\u201d said Lei Xing, an independent analyst of the Chinese auto industry based in Amherst, Mass. \u201cYou could look at it as the Tesla of batteries.\u201d",
      "International investors clamored for CATL stock despite U.S.-China tensions that have effectively kept it and other Chinese EV and battery makers \u2014 and their world-leading technology \u2014 out of the U.S., the second-largest passenger vehicle market in the world after China. U.S. investors were restricted from buying stock unless they had offshore accounts.",
      "Zeng was joined by officials representing the coastal city of Ningde in China\u2019s Fujian province, where CATL is based.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong listing means that we are more deeply integrated into the global capital market, and it marks a new starting point in promoting the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d he said.",
      "The listing is also a boost for the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, an international financial hub where the market has been sluggish in recent years.",
      "One reason Chinese companies are choosing to list in Hong Kong is to mitigate geopolitical risk, Xing said, as it\u2019s \u201ccloser to home, safer.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., CATL is among dozens of companies the Pentagon blacklisted in the final days of the Biden administration over alleged ties to the Chinese military, which CATL denies.

      "Ford has faced questions from lawmakers over an agreement to license technology from CATL to produce battery cells at a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan.",
      "Chinese EV and battery makers also face a 100% U.S. tariff on EVs and a 25% tariff on lithium-ion EV batteries introduced by the Biden administration, as well as the steep tariffs on all Chinese imports imposed by President Donald Trump, with both presidents citing unfair trade practices by Beijing. CATL says the impact of tariffs is minimal given its limited business in the U.S.",
      "Experts say the trade barriers could slow the development of American EVs, whose high prices have discouraged consumers from buying.",
      "It would take \u201cat least a decade\u201d for the U.S. to develop its own version of CATL, Xing said.",
      "The company, which was founded in 2011 and is already listed in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, made $50 billion in revenue last year, about 70% of it in China. It faces intense competition, however, from Chinese rivals such as BYD \u2014 reporting an almost 10% decrease in revenue last year, the first such drop since CATL began releasing operating figures in 2015.",
      "CATL says it will use almost all of the funds raised in Hong Kong to build a a $7.3 billion factory in Hungary, allowing it to make batteries in Europe for automakers such as \u00a0BMW, Stellantis\u00a0and Volkswagen.",

      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the only way to make more affordable electric vehicles is to lower the battery pack price,\u201d Le said. \u201cAnd the only game in town currently able to do that are Chinese players.\u201d"

      "Two of England\u2019s worst-performing soccer teams have somehow found themselves in a high-stakes European tournament final.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, who\u2019ve served up shambolic displays in the English Premier League all year, will square off in the Europa League final Wednesday in Bilbao, Spain. The winner clinches automatic qualification for the prestigious European Champions League and the multimillion-dollar payout that comes with it.",
      "It\u2019s difficult to overstate how abysmal these iconic soccer teams have been in the English Premier League this season.",
      "Manchester United is 16th in the table, barely above the relegation zone. Its much-maligned Cameroonian goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has been prone to calamitous mistakes. And its forward line, spearheaded by Danish striker Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, has been largely impotent. The entire team has scored only 42 goals in 37 league games throughout the entire season.",
      "\u201cI always had this feeling of frustration for the season,\u201d Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said Friday after his team\u2019s 18th defeat of the Premier League season. The young Portuguese coach acknowledged that winning the Europa League on Wednesday wouldn\u2019t compensate for the shocking performances fans have been subjected to all year. \u201cEuropa League is not enough,\u201d he said bluntly.",
      "One of the few teams actually below Manchester United in the league table? Tottenham Hotspur, colloquially known as \u201cSpurs.\u201d The London team sits 17th, one position away from relegation to a lower league.",
      "Spurs\u2019 malfunctioning midfield and a slew of injuries haven\u2019t helped their dismal league position. Their captain, Heung-min Son, has underwhelmed. The South Korean star has failed to fill the goal vacuum left by England captain Harry Kane, who departed for German giant Bayern Munich two seasons ago. And Spurs have lost more than half of their games this season.",
      "In contrast to Amorim, who has conceded his coaching hasn\u2019t been up to snuff, Tottenham\u2019s Australian manager, Ange Postecoglou, has talked more glowingly about his performance despite leading Tottenham to its worst Premier League finish in history.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019d be another manager who gets to a European final that\u2019s had their ability to manage questioned as much as I have,\u201d he said defensively in an interview with TNT Sports last week.",
      "Postecoglou said he and Amorim are experiencing similar judgments ahead of the final.",
      "\u201cFor both of us, this is a significant game, because it can really salvage what many will look at as either a disastrous year or, I think, in our perspective, certainly a historic year,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite their poor play in the Premier League, both squads have risen to the occasion in the Europa League. Manchester United hasn\u2019t lost a match on its way to the final, brushing past Spanish club Athletic Bilbao and French club Lyon en route. Tottenham has also been impressive, defeating German outfit Eintracht Frankfurt, Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and the breakout team of the tournament, Norwegian club Bod\u00f8/Glimt.",
      "European soccer elitists turn up their noses at the Europa League because of its second-rate status. The Europa League is considered junior varsity compared with the Champions League. The latter features soccer royalty like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The Europa League tournament\u2019s appeal lies in the fact that the winner automatically qualifies into the Champions League, club soccer\u2019s most prestigious tournament with the highest caliber of play.",

    "story": [
      "Local officials are looking for ways to keep political polarization at bay as it continues to rage around them in the wider world, according to a new survey by the nonprofit research organization CivicPulse.",
      "Just under a third of local government leaders who took part in the survey, which was commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and released Tuesday, said political polarization negatively affects their communities \"a great deal\" or \"a lot\" \u2014 matching the 31% who said the same in an earlier survey by the nonprofit groups before the 2024 election.",
      "While their perceptions have held steady, local officials are seeking new ways to prevent what 83% of them called the substantial harmful impact of polarization on the nation from seeping into their communities.",
      "The survey of nearly 1,300 community leaders from around the country, conducted from January through March, is the second in a three-part series on the local impact of political polarization. The results, drawn from municipalities of a few thousand people to tens of thousands, again suggest local governments \u2014 especially in smaller communities \u2014 are more insulated from the negative effects of polarization than state and national ones.",
      "Still, the responses showed that local leaders believe the negative community impact hasn't subsided even after the conclusion of last year's heated election, driving a variety of mitigation efforts.",
      "They include focusing on hyperlocal policy areas that the public, regardless of party affiliation, can agree on; emphasizing neutral language, evidence and community benefits in communications; hosting community events to raise awareness of what local government is doing; and introducing volunteering opportunities and civics education.",
      "\u201cThe finding that perceptions of political polarization are slow to change confirms the need for sustained commitments,\u201d Louise Richardson, president of the Carnegie Corporation, said in a statement. \u201cEvidently local government leaders are looking for ways to foster more cohesive environments, and in so doing are providing examples for other communities.\u201d",
      "Choosing topics to transcend polarization",
      "Just under half of respondents, or 48%, said they choose to devote their time to policy topics that universally affect the community, like infrastructure, housing and public safety, to avoid potential politicization. Local leaders said that when opinions on topics could fall along national party lines, they try to reframe the issues to lessen any divisiveness, with 57% reporting they considered the challenges of polarization in deciding how to communicate about their work.",
      "James Hely, a Town Council member in Westfield, New Jersey, provided one example. He said that he and the mayor favor building affordable housing in their community but that the term can be politically charged.",
      "\"You have to be very liberal to say I want the town to have a lot of affordable housing,\" said Hely, a Democrat.",
      "Instead, he reframes the issue to focus on local control of zoning. That's because New Jersey enacted a law, known as the \"builder's remedy,\" that allows developers to sue municipalities to build affordable housing when such accommodations are lacking, sometimes overriding local zoning restrictions and the community's wishes.",
      "\"Rather than say we want to make sure we have affordable housing, you turn that around to say, one, we want to stop the builder's remedy; we want to prevent builders from coming in and crashing our zoning code,\" he said.",
      "In addition to reframing potentially polarizing topics, council members typically stick to an agenda that focuses on hyperlocal issues, Hely said.",
      "\u201cI counted up the votes that are put before the Town Council,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 98% to 99% [of the votes] there\u2019s 100% unanimity, because it just involves how much do you pay the police and how many traffic lights we need \u2014 things have nothing to do with ideology.\u201d",
      "Hely, whose Town Council consists of five Democrats and four Republicans, said partisan political rhetoric is seen as counterproductive on the council and is considered off-limits when community issues are discussed.",
      "\u201cOn the formal Town Council meetings, if anyone were to say, you know, \u2018Trump is evil\u2019 or anything critical on the national level, you\u2019d be seen as out of bounds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know \u2014 why are you talking about that? We\u2019re here to solve local problems.\u201d",
      "Zoe Warner, a member of the Malvern Borough Council in Pennsylvania, echoed Hely. She said it\u2019s easier for council members to do their work when their constituents understand \u201cwe don\u2019t have control over those larger issues\u201d that plague discussions of national politics, such as immigration or cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\u201cSo [we\u2019re] trying to work together to find solutions for things that we really do have control over, like a building going up,\u201d despite potential disagreements over things like the potential impact on traffic congestion, said Warner, a Democrat.",
      "The things that help enlist community support are \u201cbeing transparent about it, providing as much information, having the developer meet with these people, trying to find as much common ground as we can,\" she said.",
      "Public engagement is critical, respondents say",
      "Forty-four percent of the survey respondents also cited long-term volunteering opportunities as a way to fight polarization in local communities, while 38% of the school board officials surveyed described civics education as helpful. Still others said staying connected with residents is key.",
      "Forty-six percent of local leaders said hosting community events \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d decreased the negative effects of polarization. A high proportion also pointed to other methods of engagement as effective, such as hosting open meetings, holding informal office and coffee hours (where residents meet with leaders in informal settings) and inviting people to participate in things like budget planning by joining special commissions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite simple,\u201d said Jon Keeney, the mayor of Taylor Lake Village, Texas. \u201cI am and my council are 100% transparent. There\u2019s not anything that\u2019s done behind closed doors in the city.\u201d",
      "Keeney said that while he has been active in the Texas Republican Party for a long time, he has never let those political beliefs affect his agenda for the city.",
      "\u201cI have both Democrats, Republicans and actually independents on my council, and I could care less what their ideology is,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI never tried to influence any of my council members on what I put on the agenda in terms of how they would vote. So there\u2019s no backroom stuff going on in that respect.\u201d",
      "Carleigh Beriont, a Democratic town selectwoman in Hampton, New Hampshire, agreed with the survey\u2019s findings that community engagement is critical.",
      "\u201cListening is just really key,\" Beriont said. \"Like, the more I\u2019ve listened to residents, the more I\u2019ve come to understand that their views are not really represented by partisan ideology, right?",
      "\u201cI really do think that listening and being humble and organizing people in the community can be a great way to get things done,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not making decisions that I think will benefit my Democratic neighbors or my Republican neighbors. I try to make decisions that I know will benefit as many people as possible and be as transparent and accountable and open to exchange as I can be.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former Atlanta mayor who more recently served in top posts at the Democratic National Committee and in former President Joe Biden\u2019s White House and 2024 campaign, is running for governor of Georgia.",
      "She announced her campaign Tuesday morning, releasing a video on social media that recounts her upbringing and tight-knit family and criticizes President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThese days, most Georgians are right to wonder: Who\u2019s looking out for us? Donald Trump is a disaster for our economy and our country. From his failure to address rising prices to giving an unelected billionaire the power to cut Medicare and Social Security \u2014 it\u2019s one terrible thing after another,\u201d Bottoms says in the video.",
      "She criticizes Georgia\u2019s decision under successive Republican governors not to expand Medicaid, promising to do so if she is elected,\u00a0and she highlights support for first responders like firefighters and police officers, as well as teachers; promises to \u201ccrack down on corporate landlords raising prices\u201d; and says her administration would help young people get \u201cbetter pathways to college or career training.\u201d",
      "Speaking Monday with NBC News ahead of her announcement, Bottoms said that \"Trump 2.0 has been even more catastrophic for our state,\" ticking off a laundry list of sectors she said are hurting because of his actions.",
      "\"From the 600,000 people across our state who have jobs that are directly impacted by what's happening in our Port of Savannah and Trump's tariff policies to people being laid off at the CDC, Trump has directly impacted this state, and not in a positive way,\" she said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose headquarters is in Atlanta.",
      "\"Everything that Trump does is impacting us, whether you're looking at your retirement account or you are a CEO who's looking at stock prices fluctuate. He has not been a great president for Georgia,\" she said.",
      "She's now running statewide after Trump carried Georgia by 2 percentage points last year, following an even narrower victory there by Biden in 2020.",
      "Bottoms, who started her political career as a judge and a member of the Atlanta City Council, took office as mayor at the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term. She presided over the city\u2019s response to the Covid pandemic and amid the protests (some of which turned violent) in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody, as well as a fatal police shooting in Atlanta around the same time.",
      "She vocally pushed back against GOP Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s decision to lift Covid restrictions in the state, battling him in court over her decision to keep the city\u2019s mask mandates despite an order from Kemp banning the mandates. Kemp is finishing his second term and isn\u2019t allowed to run again next year.",
      "Asked about the issue of crime in Atlanta during her tenure, Bottoms argued that crime went up across the country in the aftermath of Covid, and she said that during her first meeting in the Oval Office with Biden, she pressed him for flexibility in how to spend Covid relief funding. She said she put that funding toward tangible results like an Office of Violence Prevention and a program to get young people summer jobs, which she said has helped lower crime rates.",
      "\"If it had been Atlanta and Atlanta alone that experienced this uptick, I would have known that it was something that we were not doing during that time. But unfortunately, it was experienced in communities big and small across America, \" she said.",
      "As mayor, Bottoms also signed a measure that barred the city from accepting new detainees from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She said Monday that the decision stemmed from her disagreement with the Trump administration's \"family separation policy\" during his first term.",
      "While she said that \"we can all agree that we don't want violent criminals on our streets\" no matter their citizenship status, she criticized the Trump administration over episodes like an undocumented Georgia college student\u2019s facing deportation after she was pulled over for a minor traffic stop. But Bottoms didn't directly address whether she'd seek similar prohibitions on cooperating with ICE if she's elected governor.",
      "She is the highest-profile Democrat in the race so far. On the Republican side, state Attorney General Chris Carr is running, and more high-profile Republicans could be weighing bids for the open seat.",
      "Bottoms, who is looking to become the first Democratic governor of Georgia in more than two decades, hails from its biggest city \u2014 and also the bluest part of a state that has held some of the nation's closest elections in recent years, from voting for Biden and Trump in back-to-back presidential elections to recently electing two Democratic senators. Bottoms said her pitch to voters across the state is that her platform \"transcends party affiliation\" and \"geographical lines.\"",
      "And as more Democrats raise questions about whether the party should have stuck with Biden last year and some question whether he had experienced cognitive decline in office, Bottoms said she \"didn't have any concerns about the president's cognitive abilities\" during her work with him."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in May 2020 gave momentum to a cross-ideological effort to reform the legal defense known as \"qualified immunity,\" which can protect cops even when they have violated the Constitution.",
      "Bills were introduced in Congress calling to abolish the defense.",
      "Multiple cases piled up at the Supreme Court urging the justices to intervene.",
      "Much ink was spilled.",
      "And then, nothing happened.",
      "With the fifth anniversary of Floyd's death approaching this weekend, Congress still has not passed any legislation seeking to even reform, let alone abolish, qualified immunity. The Supreme Court has rejected dozens of cases asking it to do the same.",
      "What minor changes have occurred, via court rulings or state legislative actions, have had little practical impact on a nationwide basis.",
      "For Karen Blum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston and a long-term critic of qualified immunity, the situation is nothing short of depressing.",
      "\"After George Floyd, it was the first time I was actually optimistic and very positive that something would be done, no matter how little,\" she said. \"But nothing, I mean nothing, has happened.\"",
      "The doctrine, first adopted by the Supreme Court in 1967, gives government officials the benefit of the doubt when they violate the Constitution.",
      "When a plaintiff files a federal civil rights claim, the defendant \u2014 including police officers facing excessive force claims under the Constitution's 4th Amendment \u2014 can get off the hook by arguing that it was not \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violation that its actions were unconstitutional. If qualified immunity is granted, the lawsuit is dismissed and the plaintiffs never get a chance to either negotiate a settlement or go to trial.",
      "In 2020, a Reuters investigation found that judges were increasingly granting qualified immunity at the direction of the Supreme Court.",
      "The law enforcement community strongly defends the concept, saying it is needed to give officers acting in good faith the confidence to make split-second decisions, often in extremely dangerous circumstances.",
      "The Fraternal Order of Police, a national group representing law enforcement officers, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Egregious cases",
      "Floyd's killing by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, triggered an immediate national debate over police violence, especially against Black men.",
      "But there had already been a quiet cross-ideological effort before then to reform qualified immunity, backed by such strange bedfellows as the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union and the libertarian Cato Institute. They had filed briefs at the Supreme Court hoping to persuade the justices to take a new look at the doctrine and consider amending it \u2014 or maybe ditching it altogether.",
      "For a few weeks in the summer of 2020, as racial justice protests raged, both the Supreme Court and Congress considered whether to take action.",
      "The court quickly sidestepped the issue, declining in June 2020 to hear a series of cases asking for reconsideration of qualified immunity.",
      "Ten days later, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, including a number of police reform measures on qualified immunity and other issues. But it ran into headwinds in the Republican-controlled Senate and lost momentum.",
      "\"Republican intransigence was the real explanation there, and I don\u2019t see any reason to think that has changed for the better,\" said Clark Neily, a lawyer at the Cato Institute.",
      "Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who was a co-sponsor of the George Floyd legislation, said that there were plans to reintroduce it during the current Congress but that he has \"no confidence\" it would get any traction with Republicans controlling both chambers.",
      "\"We will get to a time in this country where we will pass that legislation,\" he said.",
      "In the meantime, courts have continued to grant cops and other government officials qualified immunity in cases involving shocking claims:",
      "Police officers assisting a paramedic in Fresno, California, held a man in a prone position until he died, even after he told them he could not breathe. Police officers in Pineville, North Carolina, fired multiple shots at a man who was complying with their orders to drop a firearm. Prison officers at a facility in Columbia, South Carolina, failed to intervene when two men murdered four of their fellow inmates.",

      "Prison officers at a facility in Columbia, South Carolina, failed to intervene when two men murdered four of their fellow inmates.",
      "However, there have been small signs of incremental change.",
      "Some judges have criticized the way qualified immunity has been applied, joining a handful who had done the same before 2020. That approach has seeped into some recent rulings, those following the case law say.",
      "Chris Balch, a lawyer in Georgia who represents police departments in such cases, said the thumb on the scale in favor of officers \"has lessened in the last five years,\" meaning defense lawyers need to be ready to go to trial.",
      "He cited a January 2024 ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that denied qualified immunity to a jail intake officer after a Black inmate who had disclosed he stabbed a white man for racially motivated reasons then murdered his white cellmate.",
      "There was also a glimmer of hope for reform advocates at the Supreme Court, which in November 2020 ruled in favor of a Texas prison inmate who had been held in filthy conditions. The justices overturned a lower court that said qualified immunity protected prison officials.",
      "After reform efforts failed in Congress, there was briefly a concerted effort to enact state-level legislation that would create an alternative way to sue officers under those states' laws, making qualified immunity unavailable as a defense. Although a handful of states enacted such laws, the campaign met with considerable resistance elsewhere.",
      "More recently, President Donald Trump's re-election has in some ways sent the pendulum swinging in the other direction in the national political arena.",

      "\u201cBut I knew I had the rest of the performance to go. So, I was like, \u2018OK, I landed it, I have to put it aside for now and keep going.\u2019 But once the program ended, I was really happy for it.\u201d",
      "In 2024, he took home the men\u2019s singles title at the World Figure Skating Championships and did it yet again in March of this year. Next stop? He\u2019s eyeing the Winter Olympic Games in Milan.",
      "Competing on the world stage is, of course, no easy feat. How does Malinin keep his stress in check?",
      "\u201cFor me, music helps a lot,\u201d he explained. \u201cJust being able to listen to different types of music to either calm myself down or get myself into the right mood and the right mindset is what I use before my competitions.\u201d",

      "Whiskey is the comedian\u2019s latest passion, and during a conversation Monday with TODAY.com, Gaffigan explained why he decided to embark on the venture.",
      "\u201cThe bourbon thing \u2014 that\u2019s just for fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great irony is that people are like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing this to make money.\u2019\u201d But the truth is that he actually just loves American whiskey culture and finds the distilling process fascinating.",
      "\u201cSometimes people on social media are like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re lowering yourself to sell alcohol.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s even worse than that; I\u2019m not doing it for the money,\u2019\u201d he laughed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like gardening,\u201d he said about his other great passion. \u201cAnyone who gardens is losing money.\u201d",

      "Blake Shelton just dropped his 13th studio album, \u201cFor Recreational Use Only,\u201d a project he told TODAY.com was four years in the making. On Tuesday, he hit the plaza for TODAY\u2019s Citi Concert Series and later told us about how this album came together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think of the album as, like, inspired by anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of just approached making an album \u2014 just find the best songs I can possibly get my hands on, you know? I never set out with a direction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s probably why my music\u2019s been all over the map for my entire career,\u201d he added, laughing.",
      "When compiling the myriad of songs for an album, Shelton said he looks for \u201ca great lyric\u201d or \u201csomething that\u2019s challenging as a vocalist.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Shelton noted that he aims to remain true to himself as an artist through the process.",

      "Annie Murphy, who won an Emmy Award for her role as Alexis on the beloved sitcom \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d weighed in on fans never-ending question: Will there be a reboot?",
      "\u201cListen, I want that as badly as other people seem to. I\u2019m not going to stop trying to manifest that,\u201d she told TODAY.com on Tuesday.",
      "Whether another version of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d ever comes to fruition, Murphy said much of the cast has reunions of their own.",
      "\u201cWe all like try to keep in touch as much as we can,\u201d Murphy said, acknowledging their \u201cbeyond busy\u201d schedules. \u201cBecause it was such a special show for all of us. And we all love each other so much.\u201d",
      "Though the comedy, which ran for six seasons, wrapped five years ago, Murphy said she\u2019s still stopped on the street for one of her character\u2019s iconic lines. When Alexis would bicker with her brother (Dan Levy), she was known to memorably yell, \u201cEw, David!\u201d",
      "Murphy only actually said the line three times in the entire series, but her Valley Girl accent was so memorable that any \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d fan would recognize the phrase.",
      "When fans do remember the line, Murphy said it\u2019s sometimes \u201cscreamed in my face,\u201d while others firmly command the actor, \u201c\u2018Do it now.\u2019\u201d But, she told TODAY.com, she found a way out.",
      "\u201cNow I often just start going, like, \u2018No, how about you do it? And I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m just your support animal, and you can go for it.\u2019 And people tend to,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a way out. I\u2019ve planted a little loop for myself.\u201d",
      "Now, Murphy stars in Season 2 of the Hulu drama \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d as Imogen, a character far different from Alexis. But would the two ever be friends?",
      "\u201cThat is a very good question. No, I think Imogen would write Alexis off as a ditz \u2014 even though Alexis is not a ditz,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I think Imogen is a very judgy little minx, and I think she would make a pretty hard judgment and judge a book by its cover and never look back.\u201d"

      "Comparing Israel's actions to those of South Africa\u2019s during the decades of apartheid, the leader of the small Democrats party and longtime critic of Netanyahu, added, \u201cThe Jewish people, who have endured persecution, pogroms, and genocides throughout our history .. are the ones now taking actions that are utterly unconscionable.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders in separate calls Monday, in an attempt to stop the \u201cbloodbath\u201d of the war in Ukraine.",
      "But the president\u2019s outreach was inconclusive, and there was little sign of a breakthrough. Russia and Ukraine would hold direct talks on a ceasefire \u201cimmediately,\u201d Trump said afterward in a post on his social network Truth Social, but it was unclear what form those talks would take or when they would happen. The Vatican, Trump said, has expressed interest in hosting the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin lasted more than two hours and \u201cwas very informative and very open,\u201d Putin told Russian state media.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Monday afternoon, Trump said he had asked Putin to meet with him, but did not say whether Putin had agreed.",
      "Trump said little about his conversation with Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke first, other than to say that he had informed Zelenskyy and the leaders of other NATO countries of the negotiations. White House officials declined to offer any further details.",
      "Trump spoke with Zelenskyy twice on Monday, according to Zelenskyy, once one-on-one, before Trump\u2019s call with Putin, and again during a conference call with the Ukrainian and NATO leaders.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed to President Trump that Ukraine is ready for a full and unconditional ceasefire,\u201d Zelenskyy tweeted. \u201cIf the Russians are not ready to stop the killings, there must be stronger sanctions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPressure on Russia will push it toward real peace \u2014 this is obvious to everyone around the world.\u201d",
      "In a Monday interview with NBC News in Rome, where he was received by Pope Leo XIV, Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWe talked about a couple of what I would call the president\u2019s major peace initiatives with the pope. We talked a lot about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation. It\u2019s hard to predict the future, but I do think that, not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be, you know, really helpful, and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together. Can\u2019t predict the future, but that was very meaningful, and I think will hopefully bear fruit for the country.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said before the call that Russia \u201chighly values\u201d and is \u201cgrateful to the American side.\u201d In a briefing with journalists, he said that if the U.S. can \u201chelp to achieve our goals through peaceful means, then this is indeed preferable.\u201d",
      "Peskov was also asked about the chance of Trump and Putin meeting in person, a possibility the American president floated on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt will largely depend on what they themselves decide,\u201d Peskov said. The meeting \u201cneeds to be worked out\u201d by the two leaders in terms of dates and other details, he added.",
      "Ahead of the much anticipated Trump-Putin call, leaders from Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they spoke Sunday with Trump. The British government said in a statement that it was urging \u201cPutin to take peace talks seriously.\u201d",
      "Those leaders \u201calso discussed the use of sanctions if Russia failed to engage seriously in a ceasefire and peace talks,\u201d the statement said \u2014 something Trump has previously threatened.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, President Putin must show he wants peace by accepting the 30-day unconditional ceasefire proposed by President Trump and backed by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.",
      "Trump has been widely criticized for appearing to offer concessions to Russia while demanding sacrifices from Ukraine. Those voices were joined last week by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who gave details of why she stepped down last month.",
      "\u201cThe policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia,\u201d she wrote in an opinion piece Friday for the Detroit Free Press.",
      "\u201cPeace at any price is not peace at all \u2015 it is appeasement,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe must show leadership in the face of aggression, not weakness or complicity.\u201d",
      "While the diplomatic activity carries on, the violence in Ukraine continues. Russia has continued its near-nightly drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians, more than three years after it launched a full-scale invasion and tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "On Sunday, Russia shelled residential neighborhoods of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing a 75-year-old woman and injuring two other people, the city council posted on the Telegram messaging site.",
      "As well as being widely blamed for launching an unprovoked war, Russia is condemned across the West for the highly repressive and authoritarian state fashioned by Putin's Kremlin.",
      "On Monday, the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office labeled one of those critics, Amnesty International, as an \"undesirable organization\" and effectively banned it. The authority accused the London-based human rights watchdog of being \"Russophobic,\" trying to prolong the war, wanting to \"justify the crimes of Ukrainian neo-Nazis\" and its staffers of supporting \"extremist organizations.\"",
      "Trump, who has often spoken warmly of Putin, rarely if ever mentions these human rights concerns.",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday that he would be speaking with Putin at 10 a.m. Monday with the purpose of \u201cstopping the \u2018bloodbath\u2019 that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week.\u201d NBC News has not independently verified the numbers that Trump cited.",
      "Apparently referring both to his planned call with Putin and his slated talks with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, Trump added that \u201chopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.\u201d",
      "Despite promising on multiple occasions to end the war in 24 hours of taking office, Trump has since found the reality much different since beginning his second term.",
      "U.S.-brokered negotiations saw Russia and Ukrainian delegations meet in person in Istanbul last week for the first time since the early days of the war.",
      "However, the demands of the two sides remain far apart, with Russia saying it will only agree to a truce if Ukraine effectively surrenders. Ukraine has said these demands are unacceptable."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 On Mother\u2019s Day, Yael Alexander got perhaps the best gift: the news that her son Edan Alexander would be released from Hamas captivity the following day.",
      "One week after that life-changing phone call, NBC News spoke to Yael Alexander and her husband, Adi Alexander, about their son\u2019s more than a year in captivity and his eventual release.",
      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",
      "Israel said Sunday it would begin allowing limited resources to flow into the Gaza Strip to avoid a \u201chunger crisis.\u201d Worries of such a crisis aren\u2019t new, with aid groups warning about such conditions for months as a result of Israel\u2019s military operation.",
      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",
      "More than 53,000 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 have been killed in Gaza in the resulting war, according to health officials in the enclave, which Hamas has run since 2007.",
      "Talks to end the war have stalled, even as many Israelis urge their leaders to bring the rest of the hostages home. Adi Alexander expressed reservations about the \u201cmixed messaging.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s just a political posture,\u201d he said of Netanyahu's plan for an expanded military operation. \u201cMy expectation is going back to the bargaining table, rising above politics and prioritizing human life.\u201d",
      "The Alexander family knows all too well the suffering of the hostages.",
      "Yael Alexander recalled how her son said he held on to hope in captivity, thanks in part to seeing glimpses of his family on the news.",
      "\u201cHe saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew we were fighting for him.\u201d",
      "Their fight culminated on Mother\u2019s Day with a call from Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s\u00a0special envoy to the Middle East, who told the Alexanders that Hamas would be announcing the release of their son momentarily.",
      "Yael said she immediately packed her things and got the next flight to Israel. Adi and their other children followed on a later flight.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his country's military was \u201cmoving toward full control\u201d of the Gaza Strip as its intensifying airstrikes and ground operation there killed dozens more people overnight.",
      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is famine,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will lose international support and won\u2019t be able to achieve victory.\u201d",
      "That decision came even as Israel moved ahead with plans for a new ground offensive, dubbed \u201cChariots of Gideon,\u201d after its security Cabinet earlier this month unanimously approved plans to\u00a0seize all of the Gaza Strip.",
      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",
      "Those killed in airstrikes added to what has become one of\u00a0the deadliest weeks\u00a0of the conflict since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March.",
      "In a statement Monday, Hamas said that the Israeli military had launched \u201chundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily, targeting residential neighborhoods and densely populated civilian areas.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The United Nations said Monday that 92% of homes in Gaza have already been destroyed or damaged, in a post on X, adding that \u201ccountless people have been displaced multiple times, and shelter is scarce.\u201d",
      "In footage captured Sunday by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, Israeli missiles struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens of others.",
      "\u201cI brought five charred bodies to Nasser Hospital, but many more are still by the tents \u2014 we couldn\u2019t reach them because of the flames,\u201d Jaafar Ezzedine, a civil defense medic, told NBC News.",
      "Warda Waleed Al-Shaer, a displaced woman from Rafah, told NBC News that her brother, his wife and their children had been killed in the attacks. \u201cWhy? What happened? How can I live with losing all of them at once?\u201d she said.",
      "Following Israel\u2019s announcement to allow humanitarian assistance into Gaza, Reuters reported that aid trucks were seen lining up Monday in Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai city of Arish, apparently waiting to enter Gaza through its southern Rafah crossing."

      "Netanyahu said allowing some aid in would enable Israel to expand its new military operation, which began Saturday.",
      "It was not immediately clear when aid would enter Gaza, or how. Netanyahu said Israel would work to ensure that Hamas will not control aid distribution and ensure the aid does not reach Hamas militants.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Israel launched \u201cextensive\u201d new ground operations in\u00a0Gaza. Airstrikes in its\u00a0new offensive\u00a0killed at least 103 people, including dozens of children, overnight and into Sunday, hospitals and medics said. The bombardment forced northern Gaza\u2019s main hospital to close as it reported direct strikes.",
      "Israel began the offensive \u2014 the largest since it\u00a0shattered a ceasefire\u00a0in March \u2014 with the aim of seizing territory and displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",

Another strike on a residence there killed 10, including seven children and a woman, according to the civil defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government.",
      "Israel\u2019s military had no immediate comment. Its statement announcing the ground operations said preliminary strikes over the past week killed dozens of militants and struck more than 670 targets. Israel blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates from civilian areas.",
      "Shortly afterward, Israel\u2019s military said that it intercepted a projectile from central Gaza and another fell in an open area, with no injuries reported.",
      "Talks in Qatar",
      "Israel had said it would wait until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East before launching its offensive, saying it was giving ceasefire efforts a chance. Trump didn\u2019t visit Israel on his trip that ended Friday.",

      "Hamas has refused to leave Gaza or disarm.",
      "Israel ended the previous eight-week ceasefire in March. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry has said almost 3,000 people have been killed since then.",
      "Days before resuming the war, Israel cut off all food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza. The blockade is now in its third month, with global food security experts warning of famine across the territory of more than 2 million people.",
      "Frustration in Israel has been rising. A small but growing number of Israelis are refusing to show up for military service, even risking imprisonment. Other Israelis have been displaying photos of children killed in Gaza during weekly rallies demanding a deal to free all hostages and end the war.",
      "The war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 others. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.",

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "BASEL, Switzerland \u2014 Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday\u2019s grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest, the world\u2019s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israel and Switzerland to come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour.",
      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",
      "Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results.",
      "Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year\u2019s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points.",
      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn\u2019t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia.",
      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Raphael\u2019s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points.",
      "There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public.",
      "Sweden\u2019s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ\u2019s \u201cBara Bada Bastu,\u201d a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act\u2019s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels \u2014 a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday.",
      "The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties.",
      "Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956 as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action.",
      "The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, \u201cLighter.\u201d",
      "His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland\u2019s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged \u201cIch Komme\u201d ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks.",
      "Poland\u2019s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-old lifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall.",
      "Some 163 million people watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year\u2019s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had 123.4 million viewers last year, according to CBS.",
      "That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits.",
      "Most artists aren\u2019t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of.",

    "summary": "Syrians celebrated after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the U.S. would lift sanctions on the country\u2019s economy after 45 years.",
    "story": [
      "The streets of Syria were a carnival of car horns, fireworks and flags after President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that the United States would lift sanctions that have throttled the country\u2019s economy for more than 45 years.",
      "Trump stunned even close observers on Tuesday by saying he wants to normalize relations after Syria\u2019s longtime president, Bashar al Assad, was toppled in December. Trump met Wednesday with Assad\u2019s successor, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former leader of an al-Qaeda offshoot group, in Saudi Arabia\u00a0after urging him\u00a0late Tuesday to \u201cshow us something special.\u201d",
      "That has delighted Syrians and campaigners, who have been calling for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ruined country \u2014 a reconstruction priced up to $400 billion. When Trump made the announcement \u2014 telling a Saudi audience \u201cwe\u2019re taking them all off\u201d \u2014 Syrian housewife Dalal Qallab took to\u00a0the streets with her children in an outpouring of joy.",
      "\u201cTrump said that he will give us a chance, and we deserve that chance,\u201d Qallab, a mother of four from the port city of Latakia, told NBC News. \u201cAfter 14 years, I felt that the American president cared about us,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a historic moment. It gave us hope for a better life.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a chance at relief after a grim 14 years in a country that until now has been one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned.",
      "\u201cFor years, sanctions have caused severe damage to the Syrian economy, directly impacting citizens\u2019 lives and hindering development and production,\u201d said Syrian economy minister spokesperson Hassan Al-Ahmad in a statement sent to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis decision presents a genuine opportunity to revive the economy, restore national production cycles, and open doors to investments, technology, and markets,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the Syrian government\u2019s perspective, this decision marks a turning point that we aim to leverage wisely and rationally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been very few positive things happening in Syria,\u201d said  Aron Lund, a Syria expert and a fellow at Century International, a progressive think tank based in New York. \u201cAssad going was, of course, positive in the sense that you got rid of this mass murderer,\u201d but the \u201ceconomic morass\u201d has persisted.",
      "Assad\u2019s 2011 crackdown morphed into one of the most devastating and complex civil wars of modern times. Iran, Russia and Hezbollah lined up behind Assad, and the U.S., Turkey and others supported different rebel groups. Amid all of that, the Islamic State terroist organization thrived.",
      "Assad stayed in power by killing his own people, deploying chemical weapons and Russian bombs, and torturing and murdering them in an underground network of gulags. The U.N. estimates more than 300,000 people were killed; another 13 million were forced to flee their homes.",
      "In recent years, however, most international aid has flown into places like Ukraine and Gaza. Now it will be far easier for cash to enter Syria, Lund said. He called Trump\u2019s move \u201ca big, good thing for Syria\u2019s chances of recovering and stabilizing as a functioning nation state.\u201d",
      "Such a development would be welcomed by Syria\u2019s neighbors in the Gulf and Middle East. And indeed, Trump said his decision to lift sanctions came at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. They want to see a stable Syria, one that does not disseminate refugees, instability and terrorism, and acts as an ally against Iran.",
      "\u201cI hope to see Syria like the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Nasser Eido, 49, a lawyer who fled to Norway during the war but has since returned to Damascus since Assad fell. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can achieve this. The old regime stole the country\u2019s resources, kept the people poor and left them hungry.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s move does not come without risk, however.",
      "Questions still hang over al-Sharaa, who led Assad\u2019s overthrow and says he has reformed since his days as the leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the offensive against Assad in early December.",
      "He has given some moderate signals, appointing women and minorities to government positions and saying Sharia, the strict interpretation of Islamic law, will not be imposed. Yet some groups remain uneasy about their place in the new Syria, where there have already been mass killings of Alawites, Assad\u2019s minority Muslim sect.",
      "\u201cThere is the risk that the Syrian government, which is pretty hardcore Islamist, ends up doing horrible things: more massacres, or Christians getting killed, or something else that would not play well in Washington,\u201d Lund said. The White House could be in the position of having to defend itself \u201cagainst the charges that it maybe enabled that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk free decision.\u201d",
      "In 1979, the country was blacklisted on the State Department\u2019s first list of state sponsors of terror, alongside Iraq, Libya and former South Yemen. Today, Syria is the only one left, the others being replaced by North Korea, Cuba and Iran. This classification imposes financial restrictions, as well as banning any American military-related imports or exports.",
      "More U.S. sanctions came in 2004, followed by the first measures from the United Nations and European Union a year later. In 2011, when Assad began brutally suppressing demonstrations, the U.S., U.N. and E.U. imposed further import and export controls.",
      "After rebels toppled Assad in just 11 days with little fightback, the U.S. eased some of these restrictions, granting a six-month license that allowed humanitarian aid to enter the country.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration had shown few signs of offering easy progress. It demanded that Syria fulfill a list of conditions that included protecting minorities before any sanctions could be shifted \u2014 hence the surprise at Trump's announcement.",
      "It could be a game changer for millions.",
      "Jumana Hayek, 23, risked imprisonment and torture for receiving 100 euros (around $115) every month from her brother, who had fled to Germany.",
      "\u201cIt was hard and dangerous because sending money to Syria wasn\u2019t allowed due to American and international sanctions,\u201d said Hayek, a university student from Aleppo studying electrical engineering. \u201cMy brother took risks sending the money, and we took risks receiving it,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cWe suffered a lot, but things will change now.\u201d"

    "summary": "South Africa has a dark history of racism, including confiscating land from Black residents, before and during the anguish of apartheid.",
    "story": [
      "A day after 59 white South Africans were welcomed to America as refugees, more than 86,000 South African farmers \u2014 who are mostly white \u2014 are gathering this week at the NAMPO Harvest Day trade fair, an annual agricultural exhibition considered the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Over four days, the attendees will discuss innovations in technology, collaborations and various other elements of an industry that last year generated nearly $14 billion in revenue.",
      "Notably, according to one participant, there is no planned discussion of violence against white farmers or \u201cAfrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored, race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation\u201d without compensation, as President Donald Trump wrote in a Feb. 7 executive order that opened the way for the 59 South Africans to come to U.S., despite a ban on refugees from other nations.",
      "The executive order referenced South Africa\u2019s Expropriation Act enacted last year, which in some cases allows the government to seize unused land without compensation, something Cyril Ramaphosa, the country\u2019s president, said has not happened.",
      "The act awakened a profoundly troubling argument over land rights. South Africa's dark history of racism includes the confiscation of land from Black residents, both before and during the apartheid. Afrikaners, the minority white descendants of Dutch and French settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 1600s, were leaders of the apartheid regime that ended in 1994.",
      "The purported goal of the Expropriation Act is to shrink the vast land ownership disparity that came with the oppressive rule. According to the organization Action for Southern Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by whites, who make up 7.3% of the population. Black Africans, representing 81.4%, own only 4% of the land.",
      "Trump asserted on Monday, ahead of the refugees\u2019 arrival in the U.S., that \u201cwhite farmers are being brutally killed and the land is being confiscated in South Africa.\u201d",
      "Yet Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, said that the spirit of NAMPO this week reaffirms that \u201cgenocide\u201d of white South African farmers \u201cwas imaginary and not happening in our country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all disturbed that the U.S. side is alleging that there\u2019s genocide and mistreatment of white farmers in South Africa. It is incorrect,\u201d said Sihlobo, who is also co-author of the book \u201cThe Uncomfortable Truth About South Africa\u2019s Agriculture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anything, the sector continues to flourish. [Trump's] comments are misinformed and not mirroring the reality on the ground in the country,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "The New York Times reported 225 people were killed on South African farms over a four-year period ending in 2024. Of those deaths, 101 were Black current or former workers living on farms, and 53 were farmers, who are usually white.",
      "Nico Harris, a farmer of Afrikaans heritage, told Daily Maverick South African newspaper that the problems he sees can be overcome and stem from the government not being \u201cpro-farmer.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the refugees that have gone [to the U.S.] are not well-established family farming businesses like we are,\u201d Harris told the paper. \u201cI think they don\u2019t have an opportunity in the country and they might think that, \u2018This is an opportunity for us.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really fleeing because they are scared or worried, I think they see it as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Harris added, \u201cI think there are racially discriminating laws against white farmers, and I think they have problems and haven\u2019t got sympathy from the government. But there are no real land grabs, and I don\u2019t think there are real threats. There are individual farm attacks, but it\u2019s more related to criminal activity. We just hope our government is going to wake up and realize that they need the farmers, Black and white.\u201d",
      "One of the South Africans who arrived in the U.S. on Monday told The Washington Post that she had been advised not to speak with the media and said it had been a \u201cvery emotional, very rough couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "Theo Boshoff, CEO of AgBiz, which represents companies across the agricultural value chain, including South African and multinational companies, said crime in rural farming areas is high but \u201cnot targeted against any racial or ethnic group.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no genocide in South Africa,\u201d Boshoff added. \u201cPeople who live in rural areas, who are often farmers, are simply more vulnerable to crime and violent crime because they live in remote areas.\u201d",
      "And because they are remote, law enforcement often is not nearby to protect them. \u201cThere is no cultural or racial bias at play. White farmers, Black farmers, white farmworkers, Black farmworkers are\u00a0all equally at risk and united in combatting this challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t agree with insinuations that rural crime is motivated by politics or in any way related to South Africa\u2019s affirmative action efforts to remedy our checkered past.\u201d",
      "Solidarity, a South African trade union that represents 600,000 Afrikaner families, said in a statement in February that it does not agree with the African National Congress, which wants to close the farmland disparity gap. \u201cBut we love our country. As in any community, there are individuals who wish to immigrate, but repatriation of Afrikaners as refugees is not a solution for us,\u201c the group wrote.",
      "President Ramaphosa said on X that the country\u2019s laws \u201cbalance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d He said that a meeting with President Trump about the country\u2019s land reform policy would result in them sharing \u201ca better and common understanding over these matters.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has talked of his home country having \u201cracist ownership laws\u201d in a genocidal effort against white farmers.",
      "Fadial Adams, a member of the National Assembly of South Africa, a political body that passes legislation and analyzes executive action, warned of Musk\u2019s influence on the president. \u201cLet us not forget that Elon Musk is a beneficiary of our suffering and our slavery in South Africa, and it is not something that he hides. He was raised on a system which benefited white South Africans exclusively,\u201d\u00a0Adams said. \u201cElon Musk should stop acting like the minister for foreign affairs for South Africa. He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration and Musk representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Afriforum, a nongovernmental South African agency that supports the interests of white citizens, have called for farm murders to be classified as priority crimes requiring special attention, like gender-based violence or rhino-poaching. It does not support the Expropriation Act.",
      "\u201cMany laws identified by the Afrikaner lobby groups as racist are viewed by the African National Congress as being necessary, intentional measures to redress past wrongs,\u201d said Thula Simpson, an associate professor of history at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. \u201cSo the present developments strike at the heart of the post-apartheid consensus.\u201d",
      "As for the farmers in South Africa as a whole, Sihlobo, the economist from the Agricultural Business Chamber, pointed at how the country's earnings from exporting produce have grown from $2 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $14 billion in 2024.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re self-sufficient,\u201d Sihlobo said. \u201cThat speaks to the progress the sector has been making. You can\u2019t see numbers like that where there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d",
      "Jaco Minnaar, the chairman of AGRI SA, the largest agriculture organization in South Africa, says the larger problem is South Africa\u2019s crime rate.",
      "\u201cWe can see that farm murders in South Africa have a slightly higher rate per capita than murders in general, but it\u2019s farmers and farmworkers, which is not all necessarily white,\u201d Minnaar said.",
      "\u201cOur murder rate is one of the highest per capita in the world, even higher than some of the war-torn countries. That\u2019s something that we need to address,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t specifically see from the statistics that white people or any other demographic group are targeted. Or that there\u2019s a genocide.\u201d"

Last week, the two sides agreed to a 90-day pause for most of the new duties in order to\u00a0discuss a trade deal.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 \u00a0In the latest sign of the growing edge China\u2019s\u00a0clean energy\u00a0companies have on their U.S. competitors, the country\u2019s leading electric vehicle battery maker raised $4.6 billion in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday \u2014 the largest in the world this year.",
      "Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, the largest EV battery maker, traded as much as 18.4% above the listing price of 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.61), raising at least $4.6 billion. At a ceremony at the stock exchange in central Hong Kong, CATL\u2019s billionaire founder Robin Zeng marked the start of trading by banging a bronze \u201cmegagong\u201d reserved for only the biggest listings.",
      "The company, which makes batteries for Tesla and other automakers and has a tech licensing agreement with Ford, controls more than a third of the global market for EV batteries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the 800-pound gorilla in the battery space,\u201d said Lei Xing, an independent analyst of the Chinese auto industry based in Amherst, Mass. \u201cYou could look at it as the Tesla of batteries.\u201d",
      "International investors clamored for CATL stock despite U.S.-China tensions that have effectively kept it and other Chinese EV and battery makers \u2014 and their world-leading technology \u2014 out of the U.S., the second-largest passenger vehicle market in the world after China. U.S. investors were restricted from buying stock unless they had offshore accounts.",
      "Zeng was joined by officials representing the coastal city of Ningde in China\u2019s Fujian province, where CATL is based.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong listing means that we are more deeply integrated into the global capital market, and it marks a new starting point in promoting the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d he said.",
      "The listing is also a boost for the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, an international financial hub where the market has been sluggish in recent years.",
      "One reason Chinese companies are choosing to list in Hong Kong is to mitigate geopolitical risk, Xing said, as it\u2019s \u201ccloser to home, safer.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., CATL is among dozens of companies the Pentagon blacklisted in the final days of the Biden administration over alleged ties to the Chinese military, which CATL denies. The House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party cited that blacklisting last month in letters to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase urging them to withdraw from the deal \u2014 both banks remained involved.",
      "Ford has faced questions from lawmakers over an agreement to license technology from CATL to produce battery cells at a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan.",
      "Chinese EV and battery makers also face a 100% U.S. tariff on EVs and a 25% tariff on lithium-ion EV batteries introduced by the Biden administration, as well as the steep tariffs on all Chinese imports imposed by President Donald Trump, with both presidents citing unfair trade practices by Beijing. CATL says the impact of tariffs is minimal given its limited business in the U.S.",
      "Experts say the trade barriers could slow the development of American EVs, whose high prices have discouraged consumers from buying.",
      "It would take \u201cat least a decade\u201d for the U.S. to develop its own version of CATL, Xing said.",
      "The company, which was founded in 2011 and is already listed in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, made $50 billion in revenue last year, about 70% of it in China. It faces intense competition, however, from Chinese rivals such as BYD \u2014 reporting an almost 10% decrease in revenue last year, the first such drop since CATL began releasing operating figures in 2015.",
      "CATL says it will use almost all of the funds raised in Hong Kong to build a a $7.3 billion factory in Hungary, allowing it to make batteries in Europe for automakers such as \u00a0BMW, Stellantis\u00a0and Volkswagen.",
      "\u201cThey know that in order to continue to grow the way they want to, they really need to establish a presence outside of China,\u201d said Tu Le, the Detroit-based founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights. \u201cAnd the four-and-a-half-billion-dollar IPO is effectively building a war chest for them to do that.\u201d",
      "The \u201cirony,\u201d Le said, is that \u201cit could be the CATLs and the BYDs that provide the jobs for Americans moving forward, because they\u2019re really leading the way.\u201d",
      "CATL said last month that its new battery cell could give a car more than 300 miles of driving range with just five minutes of charging.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the only way to make more affordable electric vehicles is to lower the battery pack price,\u201d Le said. \u201cAnd the only game in town currently able to do that are Chinese players.\u201d"

      "BUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 The pro-European Union candidate in Romania\u2019s tense presidential runoff has taken a lead in the polls, preliminary electoral data shows, in a closely watched vote against a hard-right nationalist that could determine the geopolitical direction of the NATO member country.",
      "The race pitted front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It was held months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.",
      "After 8.5 million of 11.6 million votes had been counted, Dan was ahead with 53.56%, while Simion trailed at 46.44%, according to official data.",
      "Thousands gathered outside Dan\u2019s headquarters near Bucharest City Hall to await the final results, chanting \u201cNicusor!\u201d Each time his lead widened as more results came in, the crowd, many waving the flags of Europe, would erupt in cheers.",
      "Higher voter turnout than in first round",
      "When voting closed at 9 p.m., official electoral data showed a 64% voter turnout. About 1.64 million Romanians abroad, who have been able to vote since Friday at specially set-up polling stations, participated in the vote.",
      "Dan told the media that \u201celections are not about politicians\u201d but about communities and that in Sunday\u2019s vote, \u201ca community of Romanians has won, a community that wants a profound change in Romania.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Romania goes through difficult times, let us remember the strength of this Romanian society,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a community that lost today\u2019s elections. A community that is rightly outraged by the way politics has been conducted in Romania up to now.\u201d",
      "Turnout was significantly higher in Sunday\u2019s runoff and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 53% of eligible voters.",
      "Romania\u2019s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied.",
      "Standing on the steps of Romania\u2019s colossal Communist-era parliament building after polls closed, Simion predicted a significant victory, which he called a \u201cvictory of the Romanian people.\u201d Simion said that Georgescu was \u201csupposed to be the president\u201d before last year\u2019s election was annulled. He also called for vigilance against election fraud, but said that overall he was satisfied with the conduct of the vote.",
      "Shortly after 6 p.m., Romania\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said in a post on X that the election was subject to a \u201cviral campaign of fake news\u201d on the Telegram messaging app and other social media platforms, which tried to influence the electoral process and had \u201cthe hallmarks of Russian interference.\u201d",
      "Networks of coordinated disinformation have emerged as a pervasive force throughout Romania\u2019s entire election cycle. Romanian authorities debunked the deluge of fake news, Tarnea said.",
      "Simion appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the \u201chumiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s going on in Romania?",
      "Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania\u2019s political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania\u2019s old political class.",
      "Most recent local surveys indicated that the runoff would be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects.",
      "After voting in his hometown of Fagaras, Dan told reporters that he voted for Romanians \u201cwho are quiet, honest, and hardworking, and who have not felt represented for a long time,\u201d and \u201cfor strong cooperation with our European partners, not for Romania\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016, but later left, and is running independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform.",
      "Simion\u2019s rhetoric in the lead-up to Sunday had raised some concerns that he wouldn\u2019t respect the outcome if he lost. In the early afternoon, he told reporters that his team was confident in a \u201clandslide victory,\u201d if the election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d",
      "However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said that his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls close. He told The Associated Press that the ballot so far had proceeded properly.",
      "Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said that he chose Simion.",
      "\u201cA part of Romania prefers conservatism,\u201d he said.",
      "Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst, didn\u2019t want to say who she voted for but described the runoff as a geopolitical choice between East and West.",
      "\u201cIt is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope for changes in Romania in good ways.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s ahead?",
      "The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday\u2019s race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition\u2019s candidate to advance to the runoff.",
      "After coming fourth in last year\u2019s canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right.",
      "A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. Still, he insists that restoring democracy is his priority, returning \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d",
      "His AUR party says it stands for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom\u201d and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature.",
      "A stark choice: Russia or the E.U.?",
      "His critics say Simion is a pro-Russia extremist who threatens Romania\u2019s longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO.",
      "In an AP interview, he rejected the accusations, saying that Russia is his country\u2019s biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as \u201cequal partners\u201d in Brussels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don\u2019t think that he\u2019s an anti-Russian candidate,\u201d said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. \u201cI think what is driving him is \u2026 his focus on what I call identity politics.\u201d",
      "In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania\u2019s large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad."
