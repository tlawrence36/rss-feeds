      "PARIS -- Paris men\u2019s Fashion Week ended Sunday with two messages that kept coming up on runways: dress sharply, and build clothes to last.",
      "Japanese powerhouse Sacai pushed new shapes by breaking up the usual top-and-bottom silhouette.",
      "Herm\u00e8s, in an emotional farewell show for longtime designer V\u00e9ronique Nichanian, made a case for simple lines and long life.",
      "Here are five trends that stood out in the final days of shows, with a nod to each of the big collections.",
      "The season\u2019s key item was the coat \u2014 long, tailored and meant to be noticed.",
      "At Herm\u00e8s, Nichanian closed her last men\u2019s show after 37 years with a dark coat in glossy crocodile leather.",
      "Earlier looks included aviator-style pieces like shearling bombers, earflap caps and stand-up buckle collars, plus shearling dyed a coral-pink.",
      "Accessories stayed strong: boxy overnight bags and boots with bright orange soles.",
      "Junya Watanabe also made coats the center of his show, sending out classic camel and navy styles, then mixing them with sportier parts \u2014 like bomber backs, leather jacket fronts and down-jacket quilting \u2014 to make formal outerwear feel tougher and more modern.",
      "Many designers worked with classic suits and jackets, but changed how they sit on the body.",
      "At Sacai, Chitose Abe added new sections to jackets, trousers and outerwear \u2014 extra panels, pockets and quilted inserts \u2014 often built around a triangle theme.",
      "The show moved through tailored looks, workwear and strong denim, including collaborations with Levi\u2019s and A.P.C., but the big idea stayed clear: reshape the silhouette without losing wearability.",
      "Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus did the opposite with more shock.",
      "Rei Kawakubo cut into black suits and coats \u2014 altering lapels and hems \u2014 then later sent out white versions of her shapes as the mood shifted from dark to bright.",

      "Kiko Kostadinov stripped away decoration and focused on construction: clean coats and jackets with folded panels, curved collars and careful drape, often in black and mineral tones.",
      "Even details were hidden \u2014 buttons behind plackets, no obvious hardware \u2014 so the shape and movement did the talking.",

      "Jacquemus took the same \u201cdress up\u201d impulse in a lighter direction, riffing on black-tie codes with playful tuxedo twists and a knowingly retro party mood.",
      "The show, staged at the Picasso Museum, drew a celebrity crowd including Elton John, Sophie Marceau and Josh Hartnett, underlining how much the week now treats men\u2019s tailoring as both product and spectacle.",
      "Louis Gabriel Nouchi pushed the idea further in an underground car park with loud techno and an \u201cAlien\u201d theme.",
      "He mixed sharp coats and dark tailoring with provocative body-hugging pieces and graphic references, aiming for clothes that can pass in daily life while still carrying a charge.",
      "In a fashion world that moves fast, several moments pointed the other way.",
      "At Herm\u00e8s, Nichanian said she included designs she first made decades ago to show they still work \u2014 and she offered a simple goodbye message: \u201cSlow down.\u201d",
      "White Mountaineering\u2019s Aizawa also treated his final show as a long-view statement: technical outerwear, strong color and careful pattern work, framed as the end of a 20-year chapter rather than a quick trend.",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Charli xcx plays herself in \u201cThe Moment,\u201d a meta mockumentary about the end of Brat summer and grappling with otherworldly success.",
      "\u201cI was just really interested in telling this story about expectation,\u201d Charli xcx told The Associated Press the day after \u201cThe Moment\u201d debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "The 33-year-old pop star from Essex has been in the music industry since she was 16, with a career trajectory that she described as anything but straight forward. Then, in 2024, it hit a crescendo with her sixth studio album, \u201cBrat,\u201d which became a pop culture phenomenon. Finally, she said, she felt understood for a moment. And then, just as quickly, it changed.",
      "\u201cThere was this sort of, kind of, you know, persona that people really associated me with and then there were a lot of expectations put on me as a person, as an artist, of who I was then supposed to be. And I didn\u2019t fit into that sort of narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cI had got to this place where I was finally feeling so understood. Then I was like not understood again.\u201d",
      "Making something immensely popular and resonant can be a double-edged sword for an artist working in a business that would sometimes rather milk the \u201csure thing\u201d forever than let someone evolve and move on. She found herself wanting to grapple with that tension, that existential conundrum that she\u2019d experienced.",
      "A straightforward documentary didn\u2019t seem like right approach, so she and Aidan Zamiri, the 30-year-old Scottish photographer and music video director, got to work on something else, something that felt truer to them. \u201cThe Moment\u201d is a little \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d a little \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d a little meta, with the likes of Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott playing themselves, a little funny and a little wild. It\u2019s heightened, but also true.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t lie, there are definitely some crossovers,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the choices that Charli in the film makes, but I\u2019ve definitely, like, come close to it. \u2026 It was a very accurate depiction of what I\u2019ve experienced in the music industry.\u201d",
      "One of the buzziest titles in a starry program, the A24 film will be in theaters faster than most: It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 30 and expands wide on Feb. 6.",
      "In \u201cThe Moment,\u201d Charli xcx is under pressure as Brat summer comes to an end, having to stage a concert film with Amazon, with a sleazy director not of her choosing played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, promote a Brat credit card, and fall in line with what music executives want from her. She\u2019s also not sleeping and getting increasingly frazzled about everything.",
      "Zamiri, who directed her \u201c360\u201d music video and has become one of her best friends, was excited by the challenge and to direct his first feature film. He also understood intrinsically what she was going through.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this battle of expectations and of people wanting one thing from you and you feeling this pressure too, to stick with it, to keep providing that one thing for fear that maybe that attention, that excitement about you will falter if the next thing they don\u2019t love,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI love the process of making stuff. But part of it, which is often really exciting but also weird, is the sharing with the world because then it\u2019s just no longer yours anymore \u2026 it becomes its own thing which I think we saw happen in real-time with Brat.\u201d",

They\u2019re not her first on screen credits, but they do show her range in addition to her ability to carry a film, even if she\u2019s playing a version of herself.",

      "Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office.",
      "NEW YORK -- With a winter storm blanketing a large swath of the country, Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office. The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release. The Shakespeare drama, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been in theaters for two months, steadily increasing its theatrical footprint. It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",
      "But newer releases struggled. \u201cReturn to Silent Hill,\u201d the third installment in a horror series kick-started with 2006's \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d opened with $3.2 million. Though Sony released the 2006 film and Open Road distributed the 2012 follow up, the low-budget \u201cReturn to Silent Hill\u201d was put out by Iconic Events.",
      "In its second week of release, \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d dropped swiftly. The Sony release, directed by Nia DaCosta, opened last week to a disappointing $13.3 million in sales despite good reviews. But its second weekend was even worse, dropping 71% with $3.6 million.",
      "Other new releases flopped. Roadside Attractions' \u201cH Is For Hawk,\u201d starring Claire Foy, took in just $150,000 from 472 theaters. Sony's \u201cClika,\u201d about a migrant worker with music aspirations, managed only $1.2 million in 522 locations.",

      "A common question that has emerged from this year's Sundance Film Festival is: \"\u201cWill you still go to the festival when it moves to Boulder?\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Attendees at this year's Sundance Film Festival could not stand in line, step onto a shuttle bus or walk into a lounge without hearing one common question: \u201cWill you go to the festival when it moves to Boulder?\u201d",
      "Butch Ward has been a Sundance regular since the early '90s, but like many longtime festivalgoers who fell in love with its charming mountain hometown of Park City, he said he won't be following Sundance to its new setting in Colorado next year.",
      "The media professional from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, considers this the last year of the festival in its true form, \u201cbecause a Sundance outside Utah just isn't Sundance.\u201d",
      "That sentiment was shared by many attendees who had found their happy place at the Utah festival.",
      "A group of women walked down Main Street on Saturday wearing yellow scarves that read \u201cOur last Sundance 2026.\u201d Another festivalgoer with a film reel balanced atop her head held a sign dubbing this \u201cthe last Sundance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a resistance to change,\u201d said Suzie Taylor, an actor who has been coming to Sundance on and off since 1997. \"Robert Redford's vision was rooted here. And isn\u2019t it poetic that he passed right before the last one?\u201d",
      "For Julie Nunis, the joy of Sundance is grounded in the tradition Redford created in Park City more than four decades ago. The actor from Los Angeles has come to the festival nearly every year since 2001 and said she doesn\u2019t want to experience it any other way.",
      "Redford, who died in September at age 89, established the festival and development programs for filmmakers in the Utah mountains as a haven for independent storytelling far from the pressures of Hollywood. Before his death, Redford, who attended the University of Colorado Boulder, gave his blessing for the festival to relocate.",
      "Boulder emerged victorious from a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation\u2019s premier independent film festival. Sundance organizers decided to search for a new home because they said the festival had outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map and developed an air of exclusivity that took focus away from the films.",

      "Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 508-meter (1,667-foot) tower about 90 minutes after he started. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head.",
      "\u201cIt was like what a view, it\u2019s incredible, what a beautiful day,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cIt was very windy, so I was like, don\u2019t fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.\u201d",
      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.",
      "Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital city was broadcast live on Netflix with a 10-second delay. The ascent, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed for 24 hours due to rain.",

But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health. Then there were the continuing tensions with his younger son, Prince Harry, and the scandal surrounding his brother Andrew\u2019s links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Among those who is attending a course at Dumfries House is Jennie Regan, 45, who is training to be a stonemason after 15 years as a university administrator.",

      "The Sundance Film Festival is buzzing with excitement as Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde, and Charli XCX movies premiere back-to-back at the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival is in full swing, with Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx movies premiering back-to-back at the storied Eccles Theatre Friday evening in Park City, Utah. Considered some of the hottest tickets at the festival, the waitlists are already long, and the lines will surely be longer.",
      "First up is \u201cJosephine,\u201d writer-director Beth De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s raw drama about an 8-year-old girl (Mason Reeves) whose life and sense of safety is upended after she witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Gemma Chan play the parents who are unsure how to help her navigate these new emotions and fears. The film, which is part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition, is based on De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s own experience of seeing something scarring at that age.",
      "The next film, Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d will bring a distinct change in tone to the Eccles. It\u2019s the story of a college graduate in his early 20s (played by Cooper Hoffman ) who gets his first job as a kind of intern/assistant to a renowned art world provocateur named Erika Tracy (Wilde), who Arkai described as \u201cbold, daring and very controversial,\u201d a cross between Robert Mapplethorpe and Madonna.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the story of their affairs and the impact it has on this kid\u2019s life and how it kind of turns his whole world upside down,\u201d Araki told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it\u2019s sexy. And it\u2019s a ride.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a film that Araki has been working on for over 10 years, as it evolved from a comic \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a female intern to what it is now.",
      "\u201cAfter #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, all the stuff that was going on, it was literally like, I don\u2019t really want to see a woman getting dragged around by the hair,\u201d Araki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seed that kind of patriarchal dynamic, even if it\u2019s consensual.\u201d",
      "Flipping the gender roles and making the young intern a man made the movie more interesting for Araki, \u201cas a filmmaker who has always been heavily influenced by feminist film theory and feminism in general,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, he was absorbing news stories about Gen Z and how they don\u2019t have sex or relationships anymore and a new dynamic emerged.",
      "\u201cWhat I knew as an old person, as an old-timer, in terms of socialization, dating, sex, all of this stuff that seemed to be kind of falling away,\u201d Araki said. \u201cAnd so that kind of became a major theme of the movie.\u201d",
      "Things Wilde\u2019s character says are things he has also said in interviews about sex and sexuality. Her character gets into generational debates about it. And ultimately it's sex positive.",
      "\u201cIt was very important to me to make something sex positive,\u201d Araki said. \u201c\u2019I Want Your Sex\u2019 is like the opposite of \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 which I found to be very sex negative.\u201d",
      "The film also features a supporting turn from Charli xcx, who was a fan of Araki and whose \u201cBrat\u201d album cover was partially inspired by the title credits to his film \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d When she heard about this new movie, he said, she asked if she could be in it. He was interested, but told her agent that she needed to do a self-tape \u201clike everyone else\u201d to play the part of Hoffman\u2019s girlfriend.",

      "Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company countersued Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion. Judge Lewis J. Liman dismissed that suit last June. Liman did not indicate Thursday when he would rule on Lively's case.",
      "At this point, the trial remains scheduled for May 18, and could be star-studded. A document from Lively\u2019s legal team says people likely to have information about the case, besides Swift, include model Gigi Hadid, actors Emily Blunt, Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera and Hugh Jackman, influencer Candace Owens, media personality Perez Hilton and designer Ashley Avignone.",
      "Many of the text messages and emails unsealed Tuesday night were included in filings by Baldoni's lawyers, who argued that they show Lively was strategically manipulating Baldoni\u2019s public image by leveraging connections with her powerful and famous friends.",
      "Swift's messages show that before and after their feud became public, she was advising Lively how to use Hollywood's power dynamics to her advantage.",

      "\u201cWow I love how they use the song,\u201d Swift replied. \u201cWelcome to hollywood Justin.\u201d",

      "After the hearing, Lively's attorney Sigrid McCawley told reporters that the text exchange isn't relevant, and that Lively has done \u201ceverything she can to protect her friends from not being brought into that.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for Baldoni and Swift did not respond Thursday to emailed requests for comment.",
      "In another text exchange, Dec. 4, 2024, Lively checked in with Swift, writing that she felt \u201clike a bad friend lately because I was such a sad sack\u201d who only talked about her own problems \u201cfor months.\u201d",

      "Jennifer Walker Elrod, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said her query \u2014 a reference to the moral panic in the 1960s over the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands \u2014 was \u201cfanciful,\u201d but a government attorney responded that the president did have that power and courts could not stop him.",

      "The act has only been invoked three other times in American history, during the War of 1812 and both world wars. A majority of the three-judge panel agreed in last year's ruling with multiple lower court judges and immigration lawyers who brought the case that it cannot be deployed against a gang rather than a belligerent foreign power.",

      "\u201cA predatory incursion is less than an invasion,\u201d Ensign said, arguing that cases involving other laws have determined it happens when foreign fishing boats enter U.S. waters. He also noted that Trump alleged the gang was acting at the behest of recently ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government \u2014 an assertion that has been challenged by some law enforcement analysts.",
      "It's unclear when the circuit will issue its ruling, and the final decision on the constitutionality of Trump's action will likely be made by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The nation's highest court has already had to wade into the tangled legal saga of Trump's invocation of the act twice before. His administration used the act to fly 252 Venezuelans from the United States to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where it contended that U.S. judges had no authority. The Supreme Court ruled that anyone else the administration tried to remove under the act needed a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to challenge their designation as a gang member in court.",
      "The following month, as the administration hurried to prepare another flight from Texas, the high court issued an unusual midnight ruling halting flights.

      "Ten years after he won best actor for \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d it\u2019s a statistic that puts him in a rarefied group that includes Daniel Day-Lewis. Including his supporting nomination for \u201cWhat\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape,\u201d he\u2019s now among a group of only eight actors, male or female, to have achieved that milestone. Overall, he has eight nominations to his name, including a best picture credit for \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d",
      "But for DiCaprio, a consummate director\u2019s actor who spoke to The Associated Press by phone Thursday morning, the most important thing isn\u2019t even necessarily the accolades but being part of a film that\u2019s as timeless as \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",

      "In Bob Ferguson, DiCaprio got one of his greatest roles in an already illustrious career. It\u2019s a performance that\u2019s not easy to define but that spotlighted his grasp on his craft to maximum effect, allowing him to be funny, emotional, intimate and utterly authentic, whether he\u2019s yelling about not remembering a passcode, reading his daughter\u2019s friend the riot act or even just wordlessly looking at Sean Penn\u2019s antagonist Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw with all the fear in the world for his daughter in his eyes.",
      "It\u2019s not often that Oscar nominated performances also become cultural touchstones, but this Halloween there were more than a few men and women donning Bob\u2019s plaid bathrobe, black beanie and blockers on the streets around the country.",

It's a piece of art that you\u2019re proud of and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be in this film.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s one he hopes audiences revisit time and time again, finding new interpretations, new ways of looking and their characters and their intentions. The film received 13 nominations overall, second only to \u201cSinners,\u201d including best picture, best director and supporting actor nominations for Benicio Del Toro and Penn.",
      "One of the bigger snubs of the day, though, was DiCaprio\u2019s co-star Chase Infiniti, an integral part of the film as his daughter Willa who was not nominated for lead actress. DiCaprio said he\u2019d just spoken to her and that she had \u201can amazing attitude\u201d about it.",

I think there\u2019s this tide of change that is going to happen no matter how we feel about it,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the theatrical experience to immerse you and have the rest of the world disappear and feel part of something else, something bigger, something different. That\u2019s the magic of movies. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s our greatest art form and I hope the theatrical experience remains alive, but that\u2019s up to audiences and their appreciation of that art form.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio might have a tendency to be turned into memes sometimes, whether it\u2019s that image of him walking in \u201cInception\u201d or even animatedly talking to someone at the Golden Globes about \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d (Laughing, he told the AP that he was talking to a friend who will remain anonymous).",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s because he saves it all for the screen and for great filmmakers, whether it\u2019s Anderson, Martin Scorsese or Christopher Nolan. In a dark theater, 30 feet tall and impossible to look away from, all the noise evaporates.",

      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",
      "The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in \"House on Fire,\" his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.",
      "It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Donald Trump announced America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\u201d he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t airborne, a stance it didn\u2019t officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \u201cshortsighted and misguided\u201d and \u201cscientifically reckless.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",

      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",
      "In 2016, the government began allowing two children per couple and raised the limit to three children in 2021. But it has proven more difficult to reverse the mentality of people than the policy.",

      "Now, some from that generation, once dubbed \u201clittle emperors\u201d because they were so fussed over, face the pressure of meeting the expectations, including financial, of being the only child.",
      "As they reach their 30s and 40s, there is only one child to support two parents, and in some cases, up to four grandparents. For some, this can lead to anxiety and depression, Fong said.",
      "\u201cThe little emperor at some point becomes the slave,\u201d she said.",
      "China is an aging society that will likely face a major shortfall in the coming decades: not enough people of working age to support a growing population of retirees. That could burden government finances and pension systems.",
      "The government has launched a slew of polices to try to boost the birth rate, from eliminating a tax exemption for condoms to giving cash subsidies to couples who have children. But the experience of other countries shows that it's difficult to turn around a declining birth rate.",

    "story": [
      "European leaders are finding a way to speak with one voice against President Donald Trump and they're increasingly willing to say \u201cno\u201d to his demands",
      "LONDON -- No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump \u201cdaddy\u201d now.",
      "European leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying \u201cno,\u201d or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible.",
      "\"Red lines\" were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States \u201cabsolutely\u201d must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.",
      "\u201cBritain will not yield\" its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said \u201cEurope will not be blackmailed\u201d over Greenland.",
      "\u201cThreats have no place among allies,\u201d said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "The tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term \u2014 see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "But the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from \u201cappeasing\u201d Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say \u201cno\u201d to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.",
      "\u201cWe want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won\u2019t give it,\u201d Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. \u201cYou can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.\u201d",
      "In recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the \u201cfiction\u201d that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year.",
      "\u201cWhen Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. \u201cI think we have learned something.\u201d",
      "Federiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, \u201cWe are not a bad ally,\u201d after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was \u201cnot being a good ally.\u201d",
      "Trump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no \u201cneed (for) international law,\u201d he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada.",
      "\u201cIn Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,\u201d said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.",
      "\u201cIt's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,\" Shanahan said. \"It is hard for them to change.\u201d",
      "Five months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize.",
      "Secretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's \u201cTrump whisperer,\" likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a \u201cdaddy\u201d intervening in a schoolyard brawl.",

Syrian state media later reported that many were recaptured.",
      "Now, the clashes between the Syrian military and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, sparked fears of IS activating its sleeper cells in those areas and of IS detainees escaping.

      "Tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to control Greenland have caused a rift between MAGA and Europe's far-right",
      "BRUSSELS -- Tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to take control of Greenland have driven a wedge in the once iron-clad link between MAGA and Europe's far-right.",
      "The rift seems to signal that ideological alignment alone may not be enough to temper worries among European nationalists over Trump's interventionism abroad.",
      "Far-right leaders in Germany, Italy and France have strongly criticized Trump's Greenland plans. Even Nigel Farage, a longtime ally of Trump and head of the Reform UK nationalist party, called Trump's Greenland moves \u201ca very hostile act.\u201d",
      "During a debate Tuesday in the European Parliament, far-right lawmakers typically aligned with Trump overwhelmingly supported halting a EU-U.S. trade pact over their uneasiness with his threats, calling them \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cthreats to sovereignty.\"",
      "Such a divergence between Trump and his European acolytes came as some surprise.",
      "Far-right parties surged to power in 2024 across the European Union, rattling the traditional powers across the bloc\u2019s 27 nations from Spain to Sweden. Their political groupings now hold 26% of the seats in the European Parliament, according to the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.",
      "Less than a year ago, Europe's far-right parties gathered in Madrid to applauded Trump's election under the banner \u201cMake Europe Great Again,\u201d while Elon Musk, before his fall from Trump\u2019s graces, had boosted European far-right influencers and figures on X, including Germany\u2019s radical right Alternative for Germany party.",
      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance drew scorn from within Germany and across Europe after he met with AfD leader Alice Weidel during elections in February. The party, with which mainstream parties refuse to work, upset German politics by doubling its presence in the Bundestag to become the nation's second-largest party.",
      "Yet deep divisions within MAGA itself over Trump\u2019s approach to foreign affairs has reverberated in Europe, with his actions over Greenland, Venezuela and Iran forcing his political allies to favor their ideological convictions over their deference to the U.S. president.",
      "France\u2019s far-right National Rally has at times vaunted its ideological closeness to Trump, particularly on immigration.",
      "A year ago, the party sent one of its senior figures, Louis Aliot, to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. In turn, Trump has staunchly defended party leader Marine Le Pen, describing her conviction for embezzling EU funds as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "Jordan Bardella, the 30-year-old National Rally\u2019s president and a MEP, has praised Trump\u2019s nationalist views, saying to the BBC last month that a \u201cwind of freedom, of national pride\u201d was blowing across Western democracies.",
      "In recent days, however, Bardella has appeared to distance himself from the U.S. administration. In his New Year\u2019s address, he criticized U.S. military intervention in Venezuela aimed at capturing then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, calling it \u201cforeign interference\u201d designed to serve \u201cthe economic interests of American oil companies.\u201d",
      "Going further, Bardella on Tuesday denounced Trump\u2019s \u201ccommercial blackmail\u201d over Greenland.",
      "\u201cOur subjugation would be a historic mistake,\u201d Bardella said.",
      "Another Trump ally, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, echoed this sentiment. In an interview on Rai television Wednesday, she said that she told Trump during a call that his tariffs threat over Greenland was \u201ca mistake.\u201d",

      "Facing what is likely to be the toughest election of his 16 years in power in April, Orb\u00e1n has built his political identity around his affinity with Trump, promising voters that his close relationship with the president will pay hefty dividends.",
      "Trump, Orb\u00e1n has insisted, is Europe\u2019s only hope for peace amid the war in Ukraine and a guarantor of national sovereignty.",
      "Orb\u00e1n has sought to cast Trump's threats on Greenland and capture of Maduro either as beneficial for Hungary, or none of its business.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an in-house issue \u2026 It\u2019s a NATO issue,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said of Trump\u2019s plans for Greenland during a news conference earlier this month, adding that any proposed change to Greenland's sovereignty can be discussed within NATO.",
      "Despite his staunch advocacy of national sovereignty, Orb\u00e1n also praised the U.S. action in Venezuela, calling the country a \u201cnarco state\u201d and suggesting Maduro\u2019s ouster could benefit Hungary through future cheaper oil prices on world markets.",
      "Hungary\u2019s reluctance to push back on Trump\u2019s actions reflected similar positions among far-right leaders in the EU\u2019s eastern flank.",

He called on Western European leaders to tone down their objections to Trump\u2019s conduct.",
      "In the neighboring Czech Republic, prime minister and Trump ally Andrej Babis has declined to speak out against the U.S. threats to Greenland, and warned against the EU allowing the issue to cause a conflict with Trump. In Slovakia, Prime Minister Robert Fico has remained silent on Trump\u2019s Greenland designs, even as he met with the president in his Mar-a-Lago resort last week.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s deposing of Maduro led Fico to \u201cunequivocally condemn\u201d the action, calling it a \u201ckidnapping\u201d and the \u201clatest American oil adventure.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this division will stay with us or whether they can again unite forces around issues where they can cooperate. Those issues can be damaging enough for the European Union.\u201d",

      "YANGON, Myanmar -- Voting began on Sunday in Myanmar in the final round of a three-stage general election, capping a nearly monthlong process that has already ensured the country\u2019s military rulers and their allies will command a parliamentary majority to form a new government.",
      "Critics say the polls are neither free not fair, and are designed to legitimize the power of the military after it ousted the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021.",
      "The army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, or USDP, has already won most of the seats contested in the first two rounds of voting. Twenty-five percent of the seats in the upper and lower houses of the national Parliament are reserved for the military, guaranteeing it and its allies control of the legislature.",
      "Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who heads the current military government, is widely expected by both supporters and opponents to assume the presidency when the new Parliament meets.",
      "Critics say the polls, held under strict restrictions on public criticism, are an effort to legitimize the military\u2019s power after Min Aung Hlaing led the 2021 ouster of Suu Kyi\u2019s government.",
      "The takeover triggered widespread opposition that dragged Myanmar into a civil war. Security concerns engendered by the fighting meant voting was not held in more than one-fifth of the country\u2019s 330 townships, another reason the process has been described as neither free nor fair.",
      "Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told Parliament on Tuesday that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, did not send observers and would not certify the election, citing concerns over the lack of inclusive and free participation.",
      "His comments were the first clear statement that the 11-member regional bloc will not recognize the election results.",
      "Observers have been sent from Russia, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Nicaragua, Vietnam and Cambodia, all seen as authoritarian states, as well as India and Japan, regarded as democratic.",
      "Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s 80-year-old former leader, and her party are not participating in the polls. She is serving a 27-year prison term on charges widely viewed as spurious and politically motivated. Her party, the National League for Democracy, was forced to dissolve in 2023 after refusing to register under new military rules.",
      "Other parties also refused to register or declined to run under conditions they deem unfair, while opposition groups called for a voter boycott.",

      "The election is being held in three phases due to the armed conflict. The first two rounds took place on Dec. 28 and Jan. 11 in 202 of the country\u2019s 330 townships.

      "Figures released by the Union Election Commission after the first two rounds showed the USDP won 233 seats in Parliament\u2019s two chambers. That means that along with the military, which is allocated 166 seats, the two already hold just under 400 seats, comfortably surpassing the 294 needed to come to power.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's federal housing finance director, Bill Pulte, quietly granted government-backed lenders the authority to nearly double a $200 billion bond purchase that Trump ordered to try to lower mortgage rates, a move that could introduce a new level of risk for the companies.",
      "An email obtained by The Associated Press that was sent by the Federal Housing Finance Agency to top officials at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac eliminated caps that prohibited the lenders from each holding more than $40 billion in mortgage bonds. The Jan. 12 email says that \u201ceffective immediately\u201d the new amount of mortgage bonds that they could hold in their portfolios was raised to $225 billion apiece.",
      "If the mortgage buyers were to act on the full extent of this new authority, that would amount to a roughly $170 billion increase in bond purchases over what the president instructed them to buy. Neither Pulte nor the FHFA addressed questions about whether Trump or Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was consulted before the increase was enacted.",
      "The changes to the purchasing rules effectively reverse nearly two decades of bipartisan consensus that limits should be imposed after the government had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-09, which led to both being placed into a government conservatorship.",
      "Before this story was published, Pulte took to X, calling it \u201cfake news.\u201d",
      "\u201cFHFA simply gave each entity legal flexibility to go beyond their previous caps,\u201d Pulte wrote Friday, adding that despite the lenders' new bond purchasing authority, they would not \u201cexceed $200 billion.\u201d",
      "The White House, the Treasury Department, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Some members of Congress who were closely involved in the fallout from the financial crisis have raised concerns about Pulte and the Republican administration's new approach. They say any benefit from the mortgage bond purchase will be fleeting unless the tight supply of homes can be increased. Without that, they argue, any decrease in interest rates will only drive up home prices as sellers adapt to the lower cost of borrowing by increasing their asking prices.",
      "\u201cThis is just a smoke screen for Trump and Bill Pulte to tweet about \u2014 it will do little, if anything, to lower mortgage interest rates over the long term and raises questions about increased risks to Fannie and Freddie,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s banking committee.",
      "The episode offers the latest example of Pulte\u2019s turbulent tenure in a typically low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Pulte, who also appointed himself chair of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has used the post to cultivate his own political profile and spearheaded efforts to initiate federal criminal investigations of some of Trump\u2019s chief antagonists.",
      "Pulte was identified as a driving force behind the administration\u2019s decision to criminally investigate Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to Bloomberg News, provoking an outcry from some prominent Republicans in Congress.",
      "Pulte has presided over the firing of executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as ethics officials at Fannie Mae who were investigating him and his allies. He also has pushed Trump to endorse policy ideas that were widely panned. In November, Pulte convinced Trump of the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building \u2014 a proposal that would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.",
      "Fannie Mae was created in 1938 as part of the New Deal to shore up the mortgage industry. Congress created Freddie Mac in 1970 to provide additional liquidity to the housing market. The institutions buy up the vast majority of mortgages that lenders issue to homeowners, which are then packaged into bonds that are sold to investors.",
      "Both now exist as private companies, but due to their government charters, are subject to additional regulation and can borrow money at far lower costs. Because of this government affiliation, markets also broadly recognize the financial products they sell as federally guaranteed.",
      "But there is a tension between the lenders' public mission and their desire to generate earnings, which has at times led both to take on heightened levels of risk, as was the case before the financial crisis. That led to both being placed in a government conservatorship.",

      "As a result, the federal government forced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draw down their mortgage investment portfolios, which the Treasury capped at $450 billion. The FHFA went further, gradually ratcheting down the amount of mortgage bonds they could each retain, which was set as low as $25 billion earlier this year, records show.",
      "Now Pulte is overseeing a reversal of that. Both lenders are still subject to the Treasury's $450 billion cap. But with their newly granted limits, they can adjust their portfolios to take on a far more aggressive \u2014 and riskier \u2014 approach toward buying mortgage bonds.",
      "At first, Pulte took a slow approach. In recent months, the FHFA granted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac small increases in their mortgage bond buying capacities, which essentially served as a test run for Trump's announcement this month, according to housing market analysts.",
      "Now that both lenders have the authority to stake out a larger position, they could use it to boost earnings before an anticipated initial public offering that would allow investors to buy significant stakes in the companies. Neither company, however, seems to have enough cash or liquid assets to make a $225 billion purchase, which could require taking on debt, analysts say.",
      "Though Pulte maintains that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not buy more bonds than Trump ordered, the email that his agency sent to the lenders did not directly address the issue.",
      "The email instructed the companies to increase bond investments to \u201cexert meaningful downward pressure\" on rates. Both companies were directed to submit purchasing plans to the FHFA, but the agency also made clear that the \u201ccommencement of increases\u201d in purchases did not require its approval first.",
      "The moves demonstrate the extent to which mortgage interest rates have become a political liability for Trump before the midterm elections in November, when Republicans\u2019 control of Congress will be on the line.",
      "But the plan, as announced by Trump, has already been criticized by many economists and housing policy experts as a gimmick considering the mammoth size of the $13 trillion U.S. mortgage market.",
      "\u201cIt does raise the question of whether we\u2019re letting the genie back out of the bottle. That wouldn\u2019t be so worrisome if the genie hadn\u2019t done so much damage the last time around,\u201d said Jim Parrott, who served on the National Economic Council during Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and counseled him on housing issues.",
      "Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, likened Trump's initial $200 billion announcement to a \u201csugar high.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may have an effect, but it will be fleeting,\u201d said Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive. He noted that while Trump's announcement briefly drove mortgage rates down, they ticked back up after Trump threatened a takeover of Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt's easy for the federal government to make a mistake here. They've done it in the past,\u201d Pinto said.",

      "DAVOS, Switzerland -- Leading global economic policymakers at the World Economic Forum in Davos urged countries and businesses to filter out the turmoil from a week of clashes with the Trump administration and focus on boosting growth and fighting inequality in a world where trade will continue to flow and international cooperation is still badly needed.",

      "One of the areas targeted by Malawian health officials for the three-day rollout that ended on Friday was the densely populated Chilomoni township in the commercial capital, Blantyre. At least 17 people have been diagnosed with cholera in the city in recent weeks, with one death reported, and authorities warned of \u201ca steady rise\u201d in cases nationally.",
      "Dr. Gift Kawalazira, director of health and social services at the Blantyre District Health Office, said Thursday that officials had identified unsafe water sources as the likely reason for the cholera cases reported in Chilomoni \u2014 underlining how the disease especially impacts impoverished communities with restricted access to clean water.",
      "Residents often pay about 5 U.S. cents for a 20\u2011liter bucket (around 5 gallons) of clean water from private taps in Chilomoni. But when they can't afford that fee, some turn to the nearby Muluda stream, a waterway contaminated with human and animal waste, for drinking, cooking and washing.",
      "\u201cYou can see others bring their kitchen utensils and wash them right here and also wash their clothes,\u201d Kawalazira said. \u201cThis is the water that is causing cholera.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the most vulnerable populations,\" Kawalazira said, calling it \u201ca good number to start with.\u201d Cooperation between health workers and people was key, Kawalazira said, in containing the outbreak.",
      "The global cholera vaccine stockpile was severely depleted by 2022 because of demand and limited suppliers, and that left poorer countries scrambling to contain outbreaks. In Malawi, one of its worst outbreaks killed nearly 2,000 people that year.",
      "Among those seeking protection in Chilomoni this week were 24\u2011year\u2011old Harriet George, who brought her two children to a vaccination point on Thursday.",

      "\u201cWe need to make the Olympics and the CEOs who are gonna make money off the Olympics pay for things that our city and citizens need,\u201d Petersen said.",
      "Los Angeles-area chambers of commerce are also using the fight over the Olympics to target a source of long-standing frustration in the business community \u2014 the gross receipts tax.

      "She was excited when she heard LA would be hosting the 2028 Olympics.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is set to return to court on Friday as a judge weighs whether to allow or exclude certain evidence from his federal death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett wants to hear testimony about procedures that police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, said allowed them to seize and look through Mangione\u2019s backpack when they arrested him on Dec. 9, 2024, five days after Thompson\u2019s death in Manhattan.",
      "Garnett said the hearing will be limited to just one witness: an officer from the Altoona police department. The city is about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan.",
      "That officer called to testify must have \u201csufficient authority and experience to testify about the established or standardized procedures in use\u201d at the time of Mangione\u2019s arrest \u201cfor securing, safeguarding, and, if applicable, inventorying the personal property of a person arrested in a public place,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Because the hearing will focus on procedures, the officer being called as a witness \u201cneed not have had any personal involvement\u201d in Mangione\u2019s arrest, Garnett said.",
      "Mangione is also scheduled to be in court again in the federal case on Jan. 30 for a status conference. Garnett has said jury selection in his trial could begin as early as September.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges, which carry the possibility of life in prison.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers want Garnett to bar prosecutors from using certain items found in the backpack, including a gun police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which Mangione purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive.",
      "Echoing their arguments at a recent state court hearing, they contend the search was illegal because police had not yet obtained a warrant. The judge in the state case said he\u2019ll rule on evidence issues in May.",
      "Thompson was killed on Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind.",
      "Officers began searching the backpack at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant where Mangione was arrested while eating breakfast.",

      "Utility companies and state officials are preparing for a forecasted ice storm that could bring down power lines and cause widespread outages",
      "ATLANTA -- Every morning this week, Newberry Electric Cooperative CEO Keith Avery walks into his office and turns on The Weather Channel. Then he starts making calls, lining up crews and equipment to respond to outages if a forecasted ice storm cripples power across South Carolina.",
      "Avery has dealt with disasters before. Nearly every one of his 14,000 customers lost power when the remnants of Hurricane Helene tore through in 2024.",
      "But the approaching ice storm has him even more worried because ice-coated trees and power lines can keep falling long after the storm itself has passed.",
      "\u201cI hate ice storms,\u201d Avery said. \u201cThey are worse than hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Officials across the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. have been sounding the alarm about the potential for freezing rain to wreak havoc on power systems. In the South, especially, losing electricity doesn\u2019t just mean the lights going out. It means losing heat.",
      "That's because a majority of homes are heated by electricity in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Ice storms, Avery said, are especially punishing because of what happens after they move out: Crews struggle to reach damaged lines on ice-covered roads; cold, wet weather takes a toll on workers; and problems can linger for days as ice-laden branches continue to snap.",
      "\u201cYou get a power line back up and energized, and just as you leave, you hear a loud crack and boom, there\u2019s a tree limb crashing through what you just repaired,\u201d Avery said.",
      "Texas experienced the worst-case scenario in 2021, when Winter Storm Uri's freezing temperatures crippled the state's power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "But experts say Uri\u2019s damage stemmed largely from poorly weatherized power plants and natural gas systems, not downed power lines.",
      "\u201cThe main lesson was to enforce requirements for utilities to be ready for cold weather,\u201d said Georg Rute, CEO of Gridraven, a Texas-based firm that analyzes power system risks for grid operators.",
      "Rute said utilities have applied lessons from Uri, and while he does not expect a repeat of that kind of grid collapse, he warned that other vulnerabilities remain, including transmission lines tripping during extreme cold.",

      "The governor added, though, that residents could lose power as ice weighs down power lines and trees fall onto them. But, he said, energy providers are prepositioned to fix any outages, and there\u2019s been an effort to clear trees and branches near power lines in recent years.",
      "Winter Storm Uri also exposed disparities in how outages affected communities, said Jennifer Laird, a sociology professor at the City University of New York\u2019s Lehman College who studies energy insecurity. Researchers have found that residents in predominantly Hispanic areas experienced more outages, while Black residents were more likely to face outages lasting a day or more.",
      "Laird said outages expose vulnerabilities people don\u2019t anticipate, from medical equipment that requires electricity to families with infants who rely on refrigeration for breast milk. Younger households and those with lower levels of education, in particular, are less likely to have contingency plans in place, she said.",
      "\"There are lots of ways that we\u2019re dependent on energy that we don\u2019t realize until a crisis hits \u2014 and then it really exposes those vulnerabilities,\u201d Laird said.",
      "Even if this weekend\u2019s storm does not produce significant outages, the financial burden on families could linger for months. About 1 in 6 U.S. households are already behind on their energy bills, and with millions expected to turn up their heaters during the cold snap, that number could rise, Laird said.",

      "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The toll in Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has reached at least 5,002 people killed, activists said Friday, warning many more were feared dead as the most comprehensive internet blackout in the country's history crossed the two-week mark.",
      "The challenge in getting information out of Iran persists due to authorities cutting off access to the internet on Jan. 8, even as tensions rise between the United States and Iran as an American aircraft carrier group moves closer to the Middle East \u2014 a force U.S. President Donald Trump likened to an \u201carmada\u201d in comments to journalists late Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the death toll, saying 4,716 were demonstrators, 203 were government-affiliated, 43 were children and 40 were civilians not taking part in the protests. It added that more than 26,800 people had been detained in a widening arrest campaign by authorities.",
      "The group's figures have been accurate in previous unrest in Iran and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Iran\u2019s government offered its first death toll Wednesday, saying 3,117 people were killed. It added that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 were civilians and security forces, with the rest being \u201cterrorists.\u201d Iran\u2019s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, in part due to authorities cutting access to the internet and blocking international calls into the country. Iran also reportedly has limited journalists\u2019 ability locally to report on the aftermath, instead repeatedly airing claims on state television that refer to demonstrators as \u201crioters\u201d motivated by America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the allegation.",
      "The new toll comes as tensions remain high over Trump laying down two red lines over the protests \u2014 the killing of peaceful demonstrators and Tehran conducting mass executions.

      "The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.",
      "The court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "Last year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors.",
      "\u201cWe disagree,\u201d the court said then. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\u201d",
      "That is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.",
      "Allowing Cook\u2019s firing to go forward \u201cwould weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\u201d said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "But the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?",
      "Several legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,\u201d said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. \u201cThe whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven\u2019t explained exactly why.\u201d",
      "Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, \u201cI\u2019ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.\u201d",
      "Just last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the \u201cunitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.",
      "Agency directors, like Slaughter, \u201care exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries\u201d without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.",
      "With the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply \u2014 historically hasn\u2019t been overseen by the executive branch.",

      "Some legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, \u201cWhereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"",
      "The First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both \u201cconducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.",
      "But Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.",
      "There are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.",
      "\u201cThere is no fourth type of government power,\u201d Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.\u201d",
      "Still, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.",
      "And even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook \u201cfor cause,\u201d while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.",
      "\u201cThere is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t dispute that that\u2019s what Congress was doing.\u201d",
      "Paul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, \u201cit\u2019s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it\u2019s not that different. This is just like the FTC.\u201d",
      "Instead, Clement added, \u201cthey come in and say, no, we\u2019re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.",
      "For now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there\u2019s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,\u201d Clement said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- An appeal for bankruptcy protection filing of the operator of Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus has left the luxury department stores' suppliers with unpaid bills and caused a rift with Amazon, one of Saks Global's minority investors.",
      "Saks Global said last week it had secured roughly $1.75 billion to help finance the company toward hoped-for profitability. The company said it would honor all customer loyalty programs, compensate vendors and pay employees while seeking approval for its plan to pay off outstanding liabilities, which range from $1 billion to $10 billion, according to court documents.",
      "While the retailer's stores remain open for now, the bankruptcy and restructuring could likely impact the assortment of designer brands customers find online or in their local Neiman Marcus or Saks, according to industry experts.",
      "Many brands stopped shipping their goods weeks ago as Saks Global's financial distress became more evident and bankruptcy appeared inevitable, experts said. A visit to Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan last week revealed noticeable merchandise gaps, including handbags and shoes spread out along shelves.",
      "Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail, a research firm, noted it's critical for Saks to have a good assortment including trendy items from small niche brands.",
      "\u201cIf Saks or Neiman Marcus are not offering that, those customers will find somewhere else to shop,\" he said.",
      "The bankruptcy occurred a little over a year after the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue agreed to buy the Neiman Marcus Group, its upscale rival, for $2.65 billion. Amazon took a minority stake in the deal, which saddled the new holding company with significant debt at a time of rising competition and a slowdown in luxury spending.",
      "Here's a look at some ripple effects from the bankruptcy filing, including the retailers who potentially could stand to benefit:",
      "Major brands like Chanel and Kering \u2014 the parent of Gucci and Saint Laurent, among others\u2014 top the list of creditors owed the most money. But bankruptcy lawyers and industry executives expect that luxury conglomerates will be fine.",
      "The big worry: the small and medium-size brands that have already been squeezed financially by Saks. Some could shutter their businesses if bills are left unpaid.",
      "\u201cThis is very painful,\" said Joseph Sarachek, a lawyer who represents roughly 30 brands owed money by Saks. \u201dA lot of these guys are going to go out of business.\u201d",
      "Sarachek declined to name his clients for fear of retribution by Saks but said that they're owed anywhere from $600,000 to $10 million. He said his clients don't operate their own stores, and for some, Saks had been their only big retail account.",
      "He said he has recommended to his clients not to ship to Saks unless they get more clarity on payment terms.",
      "Even before the merger with Neiman Marcus, suppliers were grappling with skipped payments from Saks, creating anger and mistrust.",
      "Over the past year, that relationship only worsened, with management changing the payment terms for brands that supplied the stores, according to Gary Wassner, CEO of Hildun Corp. which provides credit guarantees to roughly 120 brands that sell to Saks.",
      "For some, Saks Global accounted for 40% to 50% of their business, he said.",
      "Wassner advised his clients not to ship to Saks starting in Dec. 19. He said Wednesday he's hoping to approve shipping next week once agreeable payment terms are negotiated.",

      "Saunders noted the retailer is hoping to generate buzz and sales, but once the court approves a plan for store closures and vendor payments, it will likely scale back the discounts \u2014 unless that particular store liquidates.",
      "Still, don't expect to grab a Chanel or Louis Vuitton handbag at 75%, Tawil said. Many of the major iconic brands have clauses triggered by a bankruptcy filing that limit discounts.",

      "Venezuela\u2019s legislature is debating a major overhaul of its oil sector, the first since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's era",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s legislature advanced a bill on Thursday to loosen state control over the country's vast oil sector in the first major overhaul since the late socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized parts of the industry in 2007.",
      "The legislation would formally break decades of state command over some of the world's largest oil reserves, create new opportunities for private companies to invest and establish international arbitration for investment disputes.",
      "Following the U.S. capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, the Trump administration has ramped up pressure on acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and other allies of the ousted leader to invite greater investment from U.S. energy companies in Venezuela\u2019s flagging oil industry.",
      "A draft of the proposed legislation, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, represents a stark retreat from the resource nationalism at the heart of Venezuela's socialist-inspired revolution.",
      "Reflecting U.S. demands, the proposed legislation would allow private companies to independently operate oil fields, market their own crude output and collect the cash revenues through contracts with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company and long the cornerstone of Venezuela\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cThe operating company shall assume the comprehensive management of the execution of the activities, at its sole cost, expense and risk,\u201d the draft says, adding that portions of production volumes \u201cmay be directly commercialized by the operating company, once governmental obligations have been fulfilled.\u201d",
      "Crucially, the bill offers companies the option of settling legal disputes through arbitration in international courts rather than just local courts. It also allows the government to cut royalties from the current 30% to as low as 15% and slash extraction taxes to persuade companies to commit to difficult projects in underdeveloped fields.",
      "The president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, told lawmakers at the start of Thursday\u2019s debate that the bill aims to \u201callow an accelerated increase in production\u201d of oil in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cOil under the ground is useless,\u201d he said, referring to the need to boost oil production and open up exploration opportunities.",
      "Pushed by Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the bill is expected to advance swiftly through the ruling party-dominated legislature.",
      "After around two hours of discussion, lawmakers gave initial approval to the bill on Thursday and sent it to a second round of debate, yet to be scheduled.",
      "During the session, Orlando Camacho, a lawmaker and head of Venezuela\u2019s national Fedeindustria business association, said the bill ensures \u201cthat oil continues to be the driving force of our country\u2019s development.\u201d",

      "Figure skating for decades has provided a progressive sort of safe space for those within the LGTBQ+ community, some of whom still may be trying to realize their authentic selves",
      "The moment Amber Glenn stepped onto the ice at figure skating's world championships, fans began to wave American flags, from the lowest rows inside TD Garden to the highest rafters, where the jerseys of Boston's sporting greats hang in honor.",
      "It seemed a fitting backdrop to her program: Glenn is the three-time reigning U.S. champion, one of the current faces of figure skating, and as the daughter of a police officer and a proud native Texan, patriotism flows through her as thick as oil.",
      "Yet the stars-and-stripes weren't the only flags flying high that night.",
      "Scattered throughout the sellout crowd at the last worlds before the Milan Cortina Olympics were the equally conspicuous rainbow flags that for nearly 50 years have signified pride within the LGBTQ+ community. They started popping up at Glenn's competitions a year earlier, when she carried one across her shoulders in celebration of her national championship.",
      "\u201cI saw them,\" Glenn acknowledged later, long after her performance, \u201cand I was proud to see both of those flags flying.\u201d",
      "Glenn, who identifies as pansexual, never sought to be an icon within the queer community.",
      "In fact, she didn't come to grips with her own sexuality until she had been through the wringer, including a stint in a mental health facility spent working through depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. Glenn didn't come out publicly until letting it slip during an interview a half-dozen years ago, and then thought with horror, \u201cI haven't even told my Catholic grandma yet!\u201d",
      "Yet as the 26-year-old Glenn reflected on her journey in an interview with The Associated Press, she expressed a profound sense of gratitude for having experienced it within the tight-knit figure skating world. For decades, the sport has provided a progressive sort of safe space for those within the LGTBQ+ community, some of whom still may be trying to realize their authentic selves.",
      "\u201cI'm so, so grateful that I grew up in skating, because I grew up in Texas, and luckily it was Dallas, which was still a bit more forward,\u201d Glenn said. \"Plus, I was homeschooled. So I had to figure out a lot of things on my own, coming from that background.",
      "\u201cBut as I ventured out to competitions, you know, outside of Texas,\" Glenn continued, \"I ended up seeing this community and these people around me, and they were some of the top coaches and really good skaters. I was like, \u2018Oh, OK. This is OK.' It made me realize, 'OK, there are people who are fans of me that would probably feel even more connected if they saw someone like them.'\u201d",
      "It hasn't always been that way in figure skating, a sport where success and failure is quite literally a judgment call, and looks, attitude and mannerisms all matter in the scores. Throughout the 1900s, and even into the \u201880s and \u201990s, women often were encouraged to be more effeminate, and male counterparts were told to embrace their masculinity.",
      "It wasn't until Rudy Galindo came out in a book released shortly before he was crowned U.S. champion in 1996 that walls began to crumble. Three-time U.S. champion Johnny Weir, now a lead analyst for NBC's coverage of the Olympics, said later that Galindo gave him the confidence to come out in 2011, and ultimately embrace who he was both on the ice and off.",
      "Eventually, other prominent skaters came forward, some of whom had never publicly acknowledged their sexuality. Each had their reasons, whether personal, political or simply the desire to give back to the community.",
      "As the U.S. team was preparing for the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, former Olympic champion Brian Boitano was picked to be a part of the delegation. At the time, the Russian government was under fire for an anti-gay \u201cpropaganda\u201d law passed in June 2013, and Boitano told the AP that he never considered coming out until he was chosen to represent his country again.",
      "\u201cThey know how private a person I am,\u201d Boitano said, \"and that this was a big move for me.\u201d",
      "While LGBTQ+ athletes compete in just about every sport, what might set figure skating apart \u2014 at least, presently \u2014 has been their success on the biggest stages, whether they be international competitions, the world championships or even the Olympics.",

It was the first move made by an administration that has been accused of targeting the rights and recognition of the LGBTQ+ community, such as rolling back protections in education, healthcare and housing.

      "\u201cBoth of my grandpas were in the military. I was raised in Texas, a proud American,\u201d Glenn told AP. \u201cIt was so disheartening. It made me feel even closer to the community around me, because we had to come together to try and protect ourselves.\u201d",
      "Those feelings continue among many in the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "One of the reasons that fan-favorite Jason Brown, a two-time Olympian, came out in an Instagram post five years ago was to provide support to those who may feel uncomfortable \u2014 skaters, of course, but also coaches, choreographers and even fans.",
      "\u201cI hope I can leave the sport a little better for the next athlete, or make someone more comfortable to step up and be who they are,\u201d Brown said. \"There are so many people out there that love and support that community, and they want them to feel safe and seen and accepted.

      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can\u2019t wait ... you need to go out multiple times.

      "\u201cThe key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,\" said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. \u201cWe also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.\"",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",

      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

      "\u201cThe Puerto Rico grid cannot afford to run on more distributed solar power,\u201d the message states. \u201cThe rapid, widespread deployment of rooftop solar has created fluctuations in Puerto Rico\u2019s grid, leading to unacceptable instability and fragility.\u201d",

      "Greenland's strategic location makes it a focal point if there were to be a nuclear conflict involving Russia, China and the United States",
      "PARIS -- In a hypothetical nuclear war involving Russia, China and the United States, the island of Greenland would be in the middle of Armageddon.",
      "The strategic importance of the Arctic territory \u2014 under the flight paths that nuclear-armed missiles from China and Russia could take on their way to incinerating targets in the United States, and vice versa \u2014 is one of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has cited in his disruptive campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, alarming Greenlanders and longtime allies in Europe alike.",
      "Trump has argued that U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for his \u201cGolden Dome\u201d \u2014 a multibillion dollar missile defense system that he says will be operational before his term ends in 2029.",
      "\u201cBecause of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday.",
      "That ushered in another roller-coaster week involving the semiautonomous Danish territory, where Trump again pushed for U.S. ownership before seemingly backing off, announcing Wednesday the \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d on Arctic security that's unlikely to be the final word.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Greenland's position at a crossroads for nuclear defense.",
      "Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, that nuclear adversaries would fire at each other \u2014 if it ever came to that \u2014 tend to take the shortest direct route, on a ballistic trajectory into space and down again, from their silos or launchers to targets. The shortest flight paths from China or Russia to the United States \u2014 and the other way \u2014 would take many of them over the Arctic region.",
      "Russian Topol-M missiles fired, for example, from the Tatishchevo silo complex southeast of Moscow would fly high over Greenland, if targeted at the U.S. ICBM force of 400 Minuteman III missiles, housed at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming.",
      "Chinese Dong Feng-31 missiles, if fired from new silo fields that the U.S. Defense Department says have been built in China, also could overfly Greenland should they be targeted at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.",
      "\u201cIf there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "An array of farseeing early warning radars act as the Pentagon's eyes against any missile attack. The northernmost of them is in Greenland, at the Pituffik Space Base. Pronounced \u201cbee-doo-FEEK,\u201d it used to be called Thule Air Base, but was renamed in 2023 using the remote location's Greenlandic name, recognizing the Indigenous community that was forcibly displaced by the U.S. outpost's construction in 1951.",
      "Its location above the Arctic Circle, and roughly halfway between Washington and Moscow, enables it to peer with its radar over the Arctic region, into Russia and at potential flight paths of U.S.-targeted Chinese missiles.",

      "The two-sided, solid-state AN/FPS-132 radar is designed to quickly detect and track ballistic missile launches, including from submarines, to help inform the U.S. commander in chief's response and provide data for interceptors to try and destroy warheads.",

      "\u201cTrump\u2019s argument that Greenland is vital for the Golden Dome \u2014 and therefore that it has to be invaded, well, acquired \u2014 is false for several reasons,\" Marcuz said.",

      "The \u201chighly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency ... if this Land is included in it,\" Trump wrote in his post last weekend.",
      "But the U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement. Before Trump ratcheted up the heat on the territory and Denmark, its owner, their governments likely would have readily accepted any American military request for an expanded footprint there, experts say. It used to have multiple bases and installations, but later abandoned them, leaving just Pituffik.",
      "\u201cDenmark was the most compliant ally of the United States,\u201d Marcuz said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s very different. I don\u2019t know whether authorization would be granted, but in any case, before, the answer was \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Towering high above Taiwan\u2019s capital city at 1,667 feet (508 meters), Taipei 101 dominates the skyline.",
      "The earthquake-proof skyscraper of steel and glass has captured the imagination of professional rock climber Alex Honnold for more than a decade. On Saturday morning, he will climb it in his signature free solo style \u2014 without ropes or protective equipment. And Netflix will broadcast it \u2014 live.",
      "The event\u2019s announcement has drawn both excitement and trepidation, as well as some concerns over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast. Many have questioned Honnold\u2019s desire to continues his free-solo climbs now that he\u2019s a married father of two young girls.",
      "Known for his legendary ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, documented in \u201cFree Solo,\u201d Honnold is intent on pushing the limits of climbing around the world.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at climbing objectives, you look for things that are singular,\u201d Honnold told The Associated Press late last year. \u201cSomething like El Capitan where it\u2019s way bigger and way prouder than all the things around it.\u201d",
      "Something like Taipei 101.",
      "Honnold won\u2019t be the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he will be the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004, as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building. He took nearly four hours to finish, almost twice as long as what he anticipated, all while nursing an injured elbow and battered by wind and rain.",
      "Honnold, who has been training for months, doesn't think his climb will be hard. He\u2019s practiced the moves on the building and spoke with Robert on his climbing podcast.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that extreme,\u201d Honnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s the perfect sweet spot where it\u2019s hard enough to be engaging for me and obviously an interesting climb.\u201d",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment will have eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by a balcony that Honnold would be able to rest on.",
      "The \u201cSkyscraper Live\u201d broadcast will be on a 10-second delay and begin Friday evening for viewers in the U.S.",
      "James Smith, an executive with event producer Plimsoll Productions, said he consulted safety advisers almost immediately after he first spoke with Honnold about attempting the climb. Smith works with a risk management group for film and TV called Secret Compass, which has supported productions in filming penguins in Antarctica and helping Chris Hemsworth walk across a crane projecting from an Australian skyscraper's roof, alike.",
      "Smith and Honnold will be able to communicate throughout the event. They\u2019ll have cameramen positioned inside the building, various hatches and places to bail during the climb and four high-angle camera operators suspended on ropes.",
      "\u201cThese people all know Alex. They trust Alex. They\u2019re going to be close to him throughout the whole climb,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get us kind of amazing shots, but they\u2019re also there just to keep an eye on him, and if there\u2019s any problems, they can kind of help.\u201d",
      "The production has also commissioned professional weather forecasters to provide updates leading up to climb day. There's currently a small chance of light rain in the morning, Smith said. Ultimately, if conditions are bad, Honnold won\u2019t climb.",
      "At his local gym, Taiwanese rock climber Chin Tzu-hsiang said he\u2019s grown up always looking up at the Taipei 101 and wondering if he could climb it. Honnold is a household name among rock climbers even in Taiwan, and Chin said he has students who have only been climbing for a year or two who are excited to watch. Based on watching Honnold in his other climbs, Chin said he trusts him to prepare for the challenge and not to recklessly take risks.",

A trend called \u201croof-topping\u201d \u2014 where people gain access to the tops of skyscrapers, often illegally, to take photos of themselves dangling from the edge \u2014 has also led to several deaths.",

      "\u201cFrom the public\u2019s perspective, this is thrill-seeking. From the climber\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a meditative art form,\u201d Smoot said.",
      "When he first heard Honnold would be ascending Taipei 101 without ropes, Smoot had questions \u2014 why do it at all, why do it without ropes, why film it live?",

      "This prehistoric art form suggests the Indonesian island was home to a flourishing artistic culture. To figure out how old the paintings were, researchers dated mineral crusts that had formed on top of the art.",

      "Meteorologists warn that a stretched polar vortex could bring severe winter weather to much of the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Warm Arctic waters and cold continental land are combining to stretch the dreaded polar vortex in a way that will send much of the United States a devastating dose of winter later this week with swaths of painful subzero temperatures, heavy snow and powerline-toppling ice.",
      "Meteorologists said the eastern two-thirds of the nation is threatened with a winter storm that could rival the damage of a major hurricane and has some origins in an Arctic that is warming from climate change. They warn that the frigid weather is likely to stick around through the rest of January and into early February, meaning the snow and ice that accumulates will take a long time to melt.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s forecast has the storm stretching from New Mexico to New England, threatening at least 250 million people.",
      "\u201cI think people are underestimating just how bad it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Ryan Maue, now a private meteorologist.",
      "The polar vortex, a patch of bitter cold air that often stays penned up in northern Canada and Alaska, is being elongated by a wave in the upper atmosphere that goes back to a relatively ice-free part of the Arctic and snow-buried Siberia. As the bone-chilling temperatures sweep through the U.S., they'll meet with moisture from off California and the Gulf of Mexico to set up crippling ice and snow in many areas.",
      "The origins of the system begin in the Arctic, where relatively warmer temperatures add energy to the polar vortex and help push its cold air south.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is aligned perfectly that the pattern is locked into this warm Arctic, cold continent,\" Maue said. \"And it\u2019s not just here for us in North America, but the landmass of Eastern Europe to Siberia is also exceptionally cold. The whole hemisphere has gone into the deep freeze.\u201d",
      "As far back as October 2025, changes in the Arctic and low sea ice were setting up conditions for the kind of stretched polar vortex that brings severe winter weather to the U.S., said winter weather expert Judah Cohen, an MIT research scientist. Heavy Siberian snowfall added to the push-and-pull of weather that warps the shape of the normally mostly circular air pattern. Those conditions \u201ckind of loaded the dice a bit'' for a stretching of the polar vortex, he said.",
      "Cohen co-authored a July 2025 study that found more stretched polar vortex events linked to severe winter weather bursts in the central and eastern U.S. over the past decade. Cohen said part of the reason is that dramatically low sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic helps set up a pattern of waves that end up causing U.S. cold bursts. A warmer Arctic is causing sea ice in that region to shrink faster than other places, studies have found.",
      "Arctic sea ice is at a record low extent for this time of year, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "The center of the stretched polar vortex will be somewhere above Duluth, Minnesota, by Friday morning, ushering in \u201clong-lasting brutal cold,\u201d Maue said. Temperatures in the North and Midwest will get about as cold as possible, even down to minus 25 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 32 to minus 34 degrees Celsius), Maue said. The average low temperature for the Lower 48 states will dance around 11 or 12 degrees (minus 12 to minus 11 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Maue said.",

Treacherous freezing rain could stretch from the southern plains through the mid-South and into the Carolinas, he said.",

      "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier and that's a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study said.",
      "With temperatures in the breeding ground increasing 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) from 2012 to 2022, three different penguin species are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study in Tuesday's Journal of Animal Ecology. And that sets up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "\u201cPenguins are changing the time at which they\u2019re breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\u201d said lead author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.''",
      "For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. They say it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

      "\u201cAppellees anticipate that thousands of protesters and observers will continue to take to the streets to exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d the ACLU said in the filing. \"As federal agents deployed to Operation Metro Surge interact with those individuals, it is more essential than ever to reinstate the district court's narrow, considered injunction to prevent violent retaliation.\"",

      "A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis",
      "WASHINGTON -- A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, a sign that the Trump administration's accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.",
      "House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying \u201cmy top priority remains keeping Americans safe.\u201d",
      "A host of other congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflected a party struggling with how to respond to Saturday\u2019s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.",
      "The killing has raised uncomfortable questions about the GOP's core positions on issues ranging from gun ownership to states' rights and trust in the federal government.",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed challenger in his reelection bid, said on social media that the shooting was \u201cincredibly disturbing\u201d and that the \u201ccredibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\u201d He pushed for \u201ca full joint federal and state investigation.\u201d Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, urged a \u201cthorough and impartial investigation\u201d and said \u201cany administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump\u2019s legacy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski called for an investigation and added that \u201cICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\u201d Collins, the only incumbent Republican senator facing reelection in a state Democrat Kamala Harris carried in 2024, said a probe is needed \u201cto determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.\u201d",
      "While calling for protesters to \u201ckeep space\u201d from law enforcement and not interfere, Collins said federal law enforcement must \"recognize both the public\u2019s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.\u201d",
      "Even Sen. Pete Ricketts, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, called for a \u201cprioritized, transparent investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy support for funding ICE remains the same,\u201d the Nebraska Republican, who is up for reelection, said online. \u201cBut we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\u201d",
      "Administration officials remained firm in their defense of the hard-line immigration enforcement tactics in the Minnesota city, blaming Democrats in the state along with local law enforcement for not working with them. Many Republicans either echoed that sentiment or stayed silent.",
      "Trump made no public appearances Sunday, though issued a number of social media posts on topics including the ballroom he is constructing at the White House and further criticism of Canada.",
      "Trump has enjoyed nearly complete loyalty from fellow Republicans during his first year back in the White House. But the positions staked out in the wake of the shooting signal the administration will face at least some pushback within the party in its swift effort to define Pretti, who protested Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, as a violent demonstrator.",
      "Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller issued social media posts referencing an \u201cassassin\u201d and \u201cdomestic terrorist.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti showed up to \u201cimpede a law enforcement operation.\u201d",
      "At a minimum, some Republicans are calling for a de-escalation in Minneapolis.",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the shooting was a \u201creal tragedy\u201d and Trump needs to tell Americans what the \u201cend game\u201d is.",
      "\u201cNobody likes the feds coming to their states,\u201d Stitt said. \u201cAnd so what is the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Americans want.\u201d",

      "Pretti's killing comes at a sensitive moment for the GOP as the party prepares for a challenging midterm election year. Trump has fomented a sense of chaos on the world stage, bringing the NATO alliance to the brink last week as he pushed Denmark to cede control of Greenland to the United States while also intensifying a dispute with Canada's prime minister. Domestically, Trump has struggled to respond to widespread affordability concerns.",
      "Meanwhile, approval of his handling of immigration \u2014 long a political asset for the president and the GOP \u2014 has tumbled in recent months. Just 38% of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling immigration in January, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll.",
      "The killing spurred notable tension with the GOP's long-standing support for gun rights. Officials say Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos that have surfaced so far appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.",
      "Yet administration officials, including Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have questioned why he was armed. Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\" Bessent said that when he has attended protests, \u201cI didn't bring a gun. I brought a billboard.\u201d",
      "Such comments were notable for a party where support for the Second Amendment's protection of gun ownership is foundational. Indeed, many in the GOP, including Trump, lifted Kyle Rittenhouse into prominence when the then-17-year-old former police youth cadet shot three men, killing two of them, during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin against police brutality. He was acquitted of all charges after testifying that he acted in self defense.",
      "In the wake of Pretti's killing, gun rights advocates quickly noted that it is legal to carry firearms during protests.",
      "\u201cEvery peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms \u2014 including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights,\u201d the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement. \u201cThese rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.\u201d",
      "In a social media post, the National Rifle Association said \u201cresponsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is often critical of the White House, said \u201ccarrying a firearm is not a death sentence.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a Constitutionally protected God-given right,\u201d he said, \"and if you don\u2019t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with anybody lawfully carrying firearms,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC. \u201cBut just make no mistake about it, this was an incredibly split-second decision that had to be made by ICE officers.\u201d",

      "In dueling news conferences, federal and state officials offered starkly different messages about the immigration crackdown that has swept across Minneapolis and surrounding cities",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- In dueling news conferences, federal and state officials offered starkly different messages Sunday about the immigration crackdown that has swept across Minneapolis and surrounding cities, with both claiming the moral high ground after another shooting death by federal agents.",
      "\u201cWhich side do you want to be on?\" Gov. Tim Walz asked the public. \"The side of an all-powerful federal government that could kill, injure, menace and kidnap its citizens off the streets, or on the side of a nurse at the VA hospital who died bearing witness to such government?\u201d \u2014 a reference to Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.",
      "In a federal office building about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino, the public face of the crackdown, again blamed the shooting on Pretti.",
      "\u201cWhen someone makes the choice to come into an active law enforcement scene, interfere, obstruct, delay or assault law enforcement officer and \u2014 and they bring a weapon to do that. That is a choice that that individual made,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "The competing comments emerged as local leaders and Democrats across the country demanded federal immigration officers leave Minnesota after Pretti's shooting, which set off clashes with protesters in a city already shaken by another shooting death weeks earlier.",
      "Video shot by bystanders and reviewed by The Associated Press appears to contradict statements by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which said agents fired \u201cdefensively\u201d against Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, as he approached them.",
      "Pretti can be seen with only a phone in his hand as he steps between an immigration agent and a woman on the street. No footage appears to show him with a weapon. During the scuffle, agents appear to disarm him after discovering he is carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and then open fire several times. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon.",
      "In the hours after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti attacked officers, and Bovino said he wanted to \u201cmassacre law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Bovino was more restrained Sunday, saying he would not speculate about the shooting and that he planned to wait for the investigation.",
      "Pretti\u2019s family said they were \u201cheartbroken but also very angry\u201d at authorities. Relatives were furious at federal officials\u2019 description of the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump\u2019s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand, and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,\u201d the family statement said. \u201cPlease get the truth out about our son.\u201d",
      "A 2024 video posted to social media showed Pretti reading a salute for veteran Terrance Lee Randolph, who died at the VA hospital where Pretti worked.",
      "\u201cToday we remember that freedom is not free,\u201d Pretti, wearing navy blue scrubs, says in the video. \u201cWe have to work for it, nurture it, protect it, and even sacrifice for it.\u201d",
      "Walz denounced as \u201cdespicable beyond all description\u201d the comments that federal officials made about Pretti.",
      "\"And I would say, President Trump, you can end this today. Pull these folks back. Do humane, focused, effective immigration control,\u201d he said.",

Here's a look at how the two Pentagon strategies address some of the traditional concerns of U.S. security policy.",

To prevent distant threats from becoming a challenge at home, the Department will continue to partner with countries in the region to build capability and promote security and stability.",

We will guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland. We will provide President Trump with credible military options to use against narco-terrorists wherever they may be. We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests. And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "2022: \u201cThe Department will maintain its bedrock commitment to NATO collective security, working alongside Allies and partners to deter, defend, and build resilience against further Russian military aggression and acute forms of gray zone coercion. As we continue contributing to NATO capabilities and readiness \u2014 including through improvements to our posture in Europe and our extended nuclear deterrence commitments \u2014 the Department will work with Allies bilaterally and through NATO\u2019s established processes to better focus NATO capability development and military modernization to address Russia\u2019s military threat.\u201d",

At the same time, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, NATO allies have committed to raise defense spending to the new global standard of 5% of GDP in total, with 3.5% of GDP invested in hard military capabilities. Our NATO allies are therefore strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe\u2019s conventional defense, with critical but more limited U.S. support.

To the contrary, our goal is far more scoped and reasonable than that: It is simply to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies. This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle. Rather, a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible.\u201d",
      "2022: \u201cThe Department will continue to deter attacks through forward posture; integrated air and missile defense; close coordination and interoperability with our ROK (South Korea) Ally; nuclear deterrence; resilience initiatives; and the potential for direct cost imposition approaches that come from globally deployable Joint Forces.\u201d",
      "2026: \u201cWith its powerful military, supported by high defense spending, a robust defense industry, and mandatory conscription, South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support. South Korea also has the will to do so, given that it faces a direct and clear threat from North Korea.\u201d",
      "2022: \u201cAs the Department continues to right-size its forward military presence in the Middle East following the mission transition in Afghanistan and continuing our \u2018by, with, and through\u2019 approach in Iraq and Syria, we will address major security challenges in the region in effective and sustainable ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Department will prioritize cooperation with our regional and global partners that results in their increased ability to deter and defend against potential aggression from Iran, for example by working to advance integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, and irregular warfare capabilities. Working in concert with global and interagency partners, the Department will redouble efforts to support regional security coalitions within the Gulf Cooperation Council and among states in the region to ensure maritime security and improve collective intelligence and warning.\u201d",
      "2026: \u201cDoW will empower regional allies and partners to take primary responsibility for deterring and defending against Iran and its proxies, including by strongly backing Israel\u2019s efforts to defend itself; deepening cooperation with our Arabian Gulf partners; and enabling integration between Israel and our Arabian Gulf partners, building on President Trump\u2019s historic initiative, the Abraham Accords. As we do, DoW will maintain our ability to take focused, decisive action to defend U.S. interests.\u201d",

      "Bad weather can derail even the best-laid travel plans",
      "Winter weather can upend even the best-laid travel plans, but one less thing to worry about is losing money if your flight is canceled: U.S. airlines are required to provide refunds.",
      "A major, dayslong winter storm is threatening to bring snow, sleet, ice and extensive power outages to about half the U.S. population. Thousands of weekend flights already have been canceled, and forecasters warn that catastrophic damage, especially in areas pounded by ice, could rival that of a hurricane.",
      "Here's a guide for travelers as flight disruptions start stacking up:",
      "When airlines expect bad weather to create problems for flights, they often give travelers a chance to postpone their trips by a few days without having to pay a fee. Search online for your airline\u2019s name and \u201ctravel alerts\u201d or similar phrases to look for possible rescheduling offers.",
      "American Airlines, for example, said it is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm, which brought freezing rain to parts of Texas on Friday. The Texas-based airline has canceled more than 1,200 flights scheduled to depart Saturday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.",
      "American also added extra flights to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport through at least Sunday \u2014 totaling more than 3,200 additional seats.",
      "Use the airline\u2019s app to make sure your flight is still on before heading to the airport. Cancellations can happen hours or even days before departure time.",
      "If you're already at the airport, get in line to speak to a customer service representative. If you're still at home or at your hotel, call or go online to connect to your airline's reservations staff. Either way, it helps to also research alternate flights while you wait to talk to an agent.",
      "Most airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge, but it depends on the availability of open seats.",
      "You can, but airlines aren\u2019t required to put you on another carrier\u2019s flight. Some airlines, including most of the biggest carriers, say they can put you on a partner airline, but even then it can be a hit or miss.",
      "If your flight was canceled and you no longer want to take the trip, or you've found another way to get to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money \u2014 even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. It doesn't matter why the flight was canceled.",

      "The airline might offer you a travel credit, but you are entitled to a full refund. You are also entitled to a refund of any bag fees, seat upgrades or other extras that you didn\u2019t get to use.",
      "If you paid with a credit card, a refund is due within seven business days after you decline an offer from the airline for another flight or a voucher, and within 20 calendar days if you paid for the ticket with a check or cash, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "U.S. airlines aren't required by the Transportation Department to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when an airline cancels or significantly delays a flight during an \u201cuncontrollable\u201d event like bad weather.",
      "Each airline, however, does have its own policies for assisting passengers who are stranded by a so-called \u201ccontrollable\u201d flight cancellation or long delay. These include disruptions caused by maintenance issues, crew shortages or computer outages that halt operations. The Transportation Department can hold airlines accountable for these commitments and maintains a website that lets travelers see what each airline promises if a major disruption is their fault.",
      "If the weather forecast is troubling, Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, suggests looking into booking a backup flight. Some airlines stand out as potential backups, Potter says, because they let customers get a full refund as long as they cancel within 24 hours of booking.",
      "The customer service phone lines will be slammed if flight cancellations and delays start stacking up during a bad storm. If you're traveling with someone who has a higher frequent-flyer status, call the airline using their priority number. Another trick: Look up the airline\u2019s international support number. Those agents can often rebook you just the same.",

      "Federal immigration officials say more than 100 people have been detained in Maine this week as part of an enforcement surge targeting what ICE calls \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement has highlighted the detention of people whom it called some of Maine\u2019s most dangerous criminals during operations this past week, but court records paint a more complicated picture.",
      "Federal officials say more than 100 people have been detained statewide in what ICE dubbed \u201cOperation Catch of the Day,\u201d a reference to the fishing industry. ICE said in a statement that it was arresting the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d including \u201cchild abusers and hostage takers.\u201d",
      "Court records show some were violent felons. But they also show other detainees with unresolved immigration proceedings or who were arrested but never convicted of a crime.",
      "Immigration attorneys and local officials say similar concerns have surfaced in other cities where ICE has conducted enforcement surges and many of those targeted lacked criminal records.",
      "One case highlighted by ICE that involves serious felony offenses and criminal convictions is that of Sudan native Dominic Ali. ICE said Ali was convicted of false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice and violating a protective order.",
      "Court records show Ali was convicted in 2004 of violating a protective order and in 2008 of second-degree assault, false imprisonment and obstructing the reporting of a crime. In the latter case, prosecutors said he threw his girlfriend to the floor of her New Hampshire apartment, kicked her and broke her collarbone.",
      "\u201cHis conduct amounted to nothing less than torture,\u201d Judge James Barry said in 2009 before sentencing Ali to five to 10 years in prison.",
      "Ali was later paroled to ICE custody, and in 2013 an immigration judge ordered his removal. No further information was available from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, and it remains unclear what happened after that order.",
      "Other cases were more nuanced, like that of Elmara Correia, an Angola native whom ICE highlighted in its public promotion of the operation, saying she was \u201carrested previously for endangering the welfare of a child.\u201d",
      "Maine court records show someone with that name was charged in 2023 with violating a law related to learner\u2019s permits for new drivers, a case that was later dismissed.",
      "Correia filed a petition Wednesday challenging her detention, and a judge issued a temporary emergency order barring authorities from transferring her from Massachusetts, where she is being held. Her attorney said she entered the United States legally on a student visa about eight years ago and has never been subject to expedited removal proceedings.",
      "\u201cWas she found not guilty, or are we just going to be satisfied that she was arrested?\u201d Portland Mayor Mark Dion said during a news conference in which he raised concerns that ICE failed to distinguish between arrests and convictions or explain whether sentences were served.",
      "Dion also pointed to another person named in the release: Dany Lopez-Cortez, whom ICE said is a \u201ccriminal illegal alien\u201d from Guatemala who was convicted of operating under the influence.",
      "ICE highlighted Lopez-Cortez\u2019s case among a small group of examples it said reflected the types of arrests made during the operation. Dion questioned whether an operating-under-the-influence conviction, a serious offense but one commonly seen in Maine, should rise to the level of ICE\u2019s \u201cworst of the worst\u201d public narrative.",

      "HONOLULU -- U.S. officials have granted a request to extend housing assistance for survivors of catastrophic 2023 wildfires, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said Friday.",
      "Nearly 1,000 households displaced by fire were anxiously awaiting word on whether federal assistance helping them stay housed will be left to expire, forcing them to find new housing or pay more for it in one of the tightest and most expensive rental environments in the country.",

      "The Pentagon has released a National Defense Strategy that chastises U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserts the Trump administration\u2019s focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere over a longtime goal of countering China",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon released a priority-shifting National Defense Strategy late Friday that chastised U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserted the Trump administration\u2019s focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere above a longtime goal of countering China.",
      "The 34-page document, the first since 2022, was highly political for a military blueprint, criticizing partners from Europe to Asia for relying on previous U.S. administrations to subsidize their defense. It called for \u201ca sharp shift \u2014 in approach, focus, and tone.\u201d That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first,\u201d read the opening sentence.",
      "It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature.",
      "As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s department will provide \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,\u201d especially Greenland and the Panama Canal.",
      "Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning.",
      "\u201cWe will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests,\u201d the document says. \u201cAnd where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Much like the White House\u2019s National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America\u2019s \u201cpacing challenge.\u201d",
      "The strategy simultaneously courts help from partners in America\u2019s backyard, while warning them that the U.S. will \u201cactively and fearlessly defend America\u2019s interests throughout the Western Hemisphere.\u201d",
      "It specifically points to access to the Panama Canal and Greenland. It comes just days after Trump said he reached a \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d on Arctic security with NATO leader Mark Rutte that would offer the U.S. \u201ctotal access\u201d to Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.",
      "Danish officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, say formal negotiations have yet to begin.",
      "Trump previously suggested that the U.S. should potentially consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accused Panama of ceding influence to China. Asked this week if the U.S. reclaiming the canal was still on the table, Trump demurred.",

      "The goal \u201cis not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them,\u201d the document says. It later adds, \u201cThis does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,\u201d it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration\u2019s sky-high tariffs. It says it will \u201copen a wider range of military-to-military communications\u201d with China\u2019s army.",
      "The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America\u2019s divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.",

      "\u201cI would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,\u201d Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.",
      "Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said \u201cthere was no help from the outside world\u201d and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.",
      "He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,\u201d said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are rules and I know them,\u201d said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.",
      "Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government\u2019s forced entry into someone\u2019s home.",

      "It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations.

      "ICE has tried what the agency called \u201cknock and talks\u201d to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.",

      "With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.",
      "Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.",

      "The cold punch coming after means it will take a while to thaw out, an especially dangerous prospect in places where ice and snow weighs down tree branches and power lines and cuts electricity, perhaps for days. Roads and sidewalks could remain icy well into next week.",

      "Michael David McKee, 39, is scheduled to be arraigned in Franklin County on four aggravated murder counts and one count of aggravated burglary while using a firearm suppressor in connection with the Dec. 30 shooting deaths of Monique Tepe, 39, and Dr. Spencer Tepe, 37.",
      "The mystery that first surrounded the case \u2014 which featured no forced entry, no weapon and no obvious signs of theft, additional violence or a motive \u2014 drew national attention. McKee, of Chicago, was arrested 11 days later near his workplace in Rockford, Illinois. He was returned to Ohio on Tuesday to face the charges against him.",
      "McKee attended Catholic high school in Zanesville, a historic Ohio city about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) east of the capital, according to the Diocese of Columbus. He enrolled at Ohio State University in September 2005 \u2014 the same semester that his future wife, then Monique Sabaturski, enrolled, university records show. Both graduated with bachelor's degrees in June 2009. Sabaturski earned a master of education degree from Ohio State in 2011 and McKee earned his medical degree there in 2014.",
      "Sabaturski and McKee married in Columbus in August 2015 but were living apart by the time Monique filed to end in the marriage in May 2017, court records show.

He completed a two-year fellowship in vascular surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center in October 2022, according to the school.",
      "McKee also lived in and was licensed to practice medicine in both California and in Nevada, where he was among doctors named in a personal injury lawsuit in a Las Vegas court in 2023. OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center in Rockford, Illinois, where McKee was working at the time of his arrest, declined to provide specific information on the dates of his employment. His Illinois medical license became active in October 2024.",
      "An Ohio grand jury indicted McKee in the double homicide last week.",
      "McKee is accused of illegally entering the Tepes\u2019 home with a firearm equipped with a silencer, shooting the Tepes \u2014 whose bodies were found in a second-floor bedroom \u2014 and leaving the property along a dark alley alongside the house.",
      "Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant has said that McKee was the person seen walking down that alley in video footage captured the night of the murders. She also said a gun found in his Chicago apartment was a ballistic match to evidence at the scene and that his vehicle's movements were tracked from Columbus back to Illinois.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with McKee's attorney.",
      "McKee is charged with two aggravated murder counts for each homicide, one for prior calculation and design and one for committing the crime, as well as facing the aggravated burglary count. If convicted, he faces a minimum of life in prison with parole eligibility after 32 years and a maximum term of life in prison without parole.",

    "summary": "As the face of Revlon, Lauren Hutton \u2013 called a \"believable beauty\" \u2013 became the highest-paid model in history, and still holds the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue. She talks about her adventurous life of no regrets.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",
      "\"But she could get away with it,\" Addie said. \"She could do this with total strangers.\"",
      "While her works fetch millions at auction now, Asawa didn't find much commercial success during her lifetime. But that wasn't her purpose, say her children.",
      "Asked what she hopes people discover from her mother's work, Addie replied, \"I think people breathe. I think people take a big, deep breath and go, 'Oh my God.' I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth. Do something with your life, you know? Learn a technique, do something, pass it on, right?\"",

    "summary": "Sales of tickets to NHL games jumped more than 20% after the hit HBO show debuted in the fall, according to ticket vendor.",
    "story": [
      "The National Hockey League has a new fan base: Enthusiasts of \"Heated Rivalry,\" the hit HBO show that debuted on the streaming platform in November.",
      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice. Yet SeatGeek data suggests that Heated Rivalry, which stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, has driven a \"noticeable spike\" in demand for NHL tickets and revenue for the league, according to the ticket seller.",
      "The mobile ticketing company said it saw weekly hockey ticket sales rise more than 20% after the show first aired.",
      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",
      "There was no similar surge in demand during the same period a year ago.",
      "\"In short, the strong lift seen so far this year did not exist during the same stretch last season, which could suggest that something beyond normal NHL demand patterns may be at play,\" SeatGeek added.",
      "SeatGeek also saw a rise in both single-ticket sales among fans attending games on their own, plus stronger demand from first-time game attendees.",
      "\"'Heated Rivalry' has certainly piqued interest in hockey and the NHL,\" SeatGeek marketing director Chris Leyden said in a statement. \"We are seeing it both in terms of more people on SeatGeek shopping for NHL tickets, as well as a pretty notable increase in single ticket buyers as more people check out a game, often for the first time ever.\"",

      "George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Paul Mescal,\u00a0  Amanda Seyfried, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis and Brad Pitt are some of Hollywood's biggest names who failed to receive an Oscar nomination in acting categories when the nominees for the 98th Academy Awards were announced in Hollywood on Thursday.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, both nominees last year for their performances in \"Wicked,\" were not similarly nominated for the sequel. In fact, \"Wicked: For Good,\" was shut out of all categories.",
      "On the opposite end, \"Sinners\" broke the record for Oscar nominations, with 16, including one in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' newest category, best casting. \"One Battle After Another\" followed with 13 nominations, while \"Frankenstein,\" \"Marty Supreme\" and \"Sentimental Value\" each earned nine.",
      "Best actor",
      "Clooney, who played a Hollywood star much like himself in \"Jay Kelly,\" was left off the best actor list, as were Jesse Plemons (\"Bugonia\"), Oscar Isaac (\"Frankenstein\"), Jeremy Allen White (\"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\"), Daniel Day-Lewis (\"Anemone\"), Joaquin Phoenix (\"Eddington\"), and Denzel Washington (\"Highest 2 Lowest\"). Hugh Jackman was not nominated for \"Song Sung Blue,\" though his partner in the film, Kate Hudson, was. Joel Edgerton, the central pillar of the film \"Train Dreams,\" was not nominated, though the picture earned four nominations, including best picture.

      "Michael B. Jordan received his first nomination for playing two characters in \"Sinners,\" while Leonardo DiCaprio earned his eighth for \"One Battle After Another.\" \"Marty Supreme\" star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, at age 30, became the youngest  male to earn three best actor nominations (after \"Call Me By Your Name\"  and \"A Complete Unknown\"), taking that title from Marlon Brando.",

It was just as shocking to find the Formula One racing film \"F1\" in the running, as it only earned nominations in the editing, sound and visual effects categories.

      "It's been common practice that when Hollywood adapts a Broadway musical, a new song is created in the hopes that it will earn a best original song nomination.

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",
      "\"One Battle After Another\" didn't do too terribly for itself, racking up 13 nominations total, including a double-dip in best supporting actor between Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn.",
      "\"Frankenstein,\" \"Sentimental Value\" and \"Marty Supreme\" earned nine nominations each, and \"Hamnet\" landed eight.",
      "What were the biggest snubs of the Oscar nominations?",
      "Among acting snubs, Chase Infiniti (\"One Battle After Another\") was tipped to be nominated for best actress, and Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet\") was expected in best supporting actor, however some noted that there may have been category confusion over whether the two were leading or supporting performances.",

      "Many expected Iranian director Jafar Panahi to make the best director shortlist for his Palme d'Or-winning feature \"It Was Just an Accident.\" He did secure a nomination for best original screenplay, and the film itself landed in a very competitive best international feature race, but many thought it would also factor into the best picture category.",
      "The best director race was always going to boast a few high-profile snubs, but most expected Guillermo Del Toro (\"Frankenstein\") to factor in, given his nomination at the Directors Guild Awards.",
      "After \"Wicked\" earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, many thought its sequel would factor into at least a few races, despite more tepid critical notices. In the end, the film was blanked entirely. Not quite as stark a departure from earlier heats, but James Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" also earned just two nominations, a franchise low.",

    "story": [
      "The Sundance Film Festival, America's leading showcase for independent narrative and documentary films from the United States and around the world, opens its 2026 edition on Thursday. This year's festival presents nearly 100 features through Feb. 1, in-person\u00a0in Utah and online.",
      "This year's program includes dramatic films with stars including Natalie Portman, Channing Tatum, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Ethan Hawke, Keegan Michael-Key, and Charli XCX. There's also a lineup of documentaries whose subjects include singers Courtney Love and Marianne Faithfull, tennis legend Billie Jean King, author Salman Rushdie, and topics like artificial intelligence, summitting K2, and children competing to sell the most Girl Scout cookies.",
      "The festival's screenings will be held in-person in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, while online screenings will be accessible for audiences across the country beginning Jan. 29. There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",

      "Among the nonfiction offerings at Sundance this year are profiles of author Salman Rushdie, and how he survived a 2022 assassination attempt (\"Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie\"); singer, songwriter and actress Courtney Love, who prepares for her first new music release in a decade, in \"Antiheroine\"; chess prodigy Judit Polg\u00e1r (\"Queen of Chess\"); and centenarians and the always-changing titleholder of \"The Oldest Person in the World.\"",
      "\"Broken English\" is a genre-twisting tribute to Marianne Faithfull, who died a year ago, and features Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Nick Cave, Suki Waterhouse and others painting a portrait of the singer-songwriter.",

Shot over 10 years, Itab Azzam and Jack MacInnes' \"One in a Million\" follows a girl navigating war and heartbreak as she travels from Syria to Germany, and later returns to Aleppo.",
      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

      "And under less-deadly circumstances, John Wilson (the dryly satirical voice behind HBO's \"How To with John Wilson\") goes through the process of trying to sell a documentary about building materials in \"The History of Concrete.\"",
      "Narrative features",
      "Pixar veteran Andrew Stanton (\"WALL-E\") directs the live-action \"In The Blink of an Eye,\" a trilogy of stories spanning thousands of years, from the lives of cave dwellers, to an astronaut light-years from Earth.

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "Leading the class of 2026 is Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, who came together in 1973 to form the unlikely creative partnership that became KISS.",
      "\"No, I didn't like [Simmons] at all. There's days he annoys me now,\" joked Stanley in a 2014 interview with CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason.",
      "But the two Jewish New Yorkers bonded over their backgrounds and shared work ethic. With Stanley, Simmons said, \"One and one is three.\"",
      "Next is Christopher \"Tricky Stewart,\" who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonc\u00e9's blockbuster hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" Raised in a musical family in Markham, Illinois, Stewart was writing songs by age 12.",
      "His big break came in 2007, with what he calls the \"single most important song\" he's ever written: Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He once told MTV about the song's success, \"When she recorded the 'ellas,' you knew your life was about to change if you had anything to do with that record.\"",
      "You oughta know the next artist on the list: Alanis Morissette.",
      "Morissette's breakup anthem, \"You Oughta Know,\" was written from what she described as fractured devastation. With her blistering lyrics, the Canadian singer set off a cultural earthquake. Her 1995 album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" sold 33 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"When I write songs, everything that jumps to the fore \u2013 lyrically and musically \u2013 is that which I have sublimated or repressed. So, it's all my unconscious writing,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers in November.",
      "Other Hall of Famers, Terry Britten and Graham Lyle helped lift Tina Turner from soul singer to superstar, writing many of Turner's greatest hits, including \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" and \"We Don't Need Another Hero.\"",
      "Britten also wrote many hits for Cliff Richard, like \"Devil Woman.\" Meanwhile, Lyle \u2013 and his bandmate Benny Gallagher \u2013 wrote \"A Heart in New York,\" famously performed at Simon & Garfunkel's 1981 concert in Central Park.",

      "\"There's just a part of my brain that's kind of scoring everything,\" Loggins said in a 2022 PBS interview.",
      "Then there's Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote and co-produced Mariah Carey's No. 1 smash, \"Hero.\" And then again, for the holiday classic, \"All I Want For Christmas is You.\"",
      "\"We'd play musical ping pong,\" he's said of his more than 11-year collaboration with Carey.",

      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Busfield was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail uniform in a New Mexico state district court, while wife and actor Melissa Gilbert watched from the court gallery.",
      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

      "Roughly an hour before the interview, Brown's assistant informed \"CBS Mornings\" that the cast member wouldn't be joining the on-set interview due to mental health concerns and, in part, because he was worried about being bullied.",

      "Bank of America already offers credit cards with initial average percentage rates below 10%. For example, its no-frills BankAmericard offers consumers a 0% introductory APR for 18 months. Once that period ends, however, the APR rises to between 14.5% and 24%, depending on the cardholder's credit score.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump earlier this month called for a 10% cap on credit card rates for one year, accusing credit card issuers of having \"ripped off\" consumers for years by charging interest rates of up to 30% for customers carrying balances.",
      "But the Trump administration has yet to provide more details on the proposal, including how it would be enforced, leaving banking executives unclear on what compliance with such an interest rate limit would entail.",
      "Credit card debt has been rising for decades, ebbing after the 2008 financial crisis and later during the COVID-19 pandemic, only to swell to a record high last year. As of the third quarter of 2025, Americans had outstanding credit card balances of $1.2 trillion, up nearly 6% from a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",

    "summary": "Only one in four Americans has a credit score above 800, which is considered exceptional, according to industry data.",
    "story": [
      "Achieving a credit score of 800 or higher can help unlock the lowest interest rates for products ranging from auto loans to credit cards, but only one in four Americans has managed to reach that level, according to credit bureau Experian.",
      "Lenders typically view scores above 800 as \"exceptional,\" a signal that a borrower consistently pays bills on time and manages debt responsibly. Most banks rely on the FICO score, developed by Fair Isaac Corp., which ranges from 300 to a maximum of 850, to assess a consumer's creditworthiness.",
      "Hitting that 800-point milestone may be more critical in 2026 than ever before.",
      "The new urgency stems from President Trump's recent push for a 10%\u00a0cap on credit card interest rates. While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",

      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",
      "Mix up your credit types",
      "Managing a variety of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, can help boost your credit score.",
      "\"Credit mix is important because a lender wants to know how you do with different types of credit, and not just a personal loan or a credit card,\" Chen of Kikoff said. \"If you have a mortgage or an auto loan, the credit scoring model gives you points for that.\"",

But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

      "Other Tesla models also struggled to entice buyers, with sales of the automaker's X, S and Y vehicles all falling year-over-year. Tesla's Model 3 was the only vehicle in its lineup to see stronger demand, with sales rising to 192,440, up 1.3% from 2024, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Tesla cited \"uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy\" as some of the headwinds it was facing in a presentation\u00a0last year. The company remains the dominant seller of electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for around 46% in 2025.",
      "\"It's been an uphill battle for sales, but a long demand curve ahead,\" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In January, the company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Tesla has been eclipsed by China's BYD as the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla isn't the only EV maker to see weaker sales. Across the auto industry, electric vehicle sales last year totaled roughly 1.3 million, a 2% drop from 2024.",
      "One obstacle is affordability, given that electric cars remain generally pricier than gas-powered vehicles. As of November, the average price of a new EV was $58,638, versus less than $50,000 for conventional cars,\u00a0according to Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax and spending bill passed by Congress last year also eliminated tax credits for both new and used EVs, which critics warned could make the cars unaffordable for many people.",
      "Multiple recalls",
      "Tesla launched the futuristic-looking steel Cybertruck in 2023 at a starting price of $60,990. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk touted them as the strongest pickup truck on the road, able to tow 11,000 pounds.",
      "However, the trucks have faced a rash of mechanical and other problems. Last year, Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks over an issue with the trim panel, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said could detach from the vehicle and pose a risk to other drivers.",
      "The vehicle has also faced recalls for issues with its rearview camera, windshield wipers and\u00a0accelerator pedals.",
      "Cybertrucks also became a flashpoint in the debate over Musk's role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. In a sign of protest,\u00a0some people vandalized Cybertrucks at Tesla dealerships.",
      "Catalysts for growth",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock price has performed well, rising rougly 9% to $450.39 over the last 12 months. Ives expects the carmaker's strength in self-driving technology and so-called robotaxis to drive growth.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts also have high hopes for a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, that Tesla is developing and expects to roll out commercially over the next year. Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, Musk said Thursday that Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks\" at Tesla plants.",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" he said.",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",

    "story": [
      "With temperatures plunging in some states as a\u00a0massive winter storm bears down across the U.S., some electric vehicle owners could face a cold, hard truth: EVs can lose efficiency in low temperatures, curtailing their driving ranges.",
      "The issue drew widespread attention in January 2024, when some Chicago-area Tesla owners found their EVs' batteries had died in subzero temperatures. Other EV owners have posted online about their vehicles' shorter ranges in winter.",
      "Cold weather can slow an EV battery's chemical and physical reactions, reducing vehicle power. And unlike conventional cars with an internal combustion engine, an EV can't tap its motor's heat to warm the interior. Instead, EVs must tap their batteries to provide cabin heat, which can sap their range, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "At 16 degrees Fahrenheit, EVs lose about 25% of their range when driving at about 70 mph, versus their range when driving at the same speed in mid-60-degree temperatures, Consumer Reports found in road testing.",
      "EV owners could be tested this weekend as extreme cold temperatures spread across the U.S., along with freezing rain, snow and rain. Thermometers in the\u00a0Minneapolis area\u00a0plunged to 21 degrees below zero on Friday morning, with wind chills making it feel even colder.",
      "Temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic states.",
      "Are newer EVs better at handling the cold?",
      "Car manufacturers have made some changes that mean newer EVs perform better in cold temperatures, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, an industry trade group.",
      "Newer EVs have heat pumps and better battery encasements that can help improve battery efficiency, ZETA noted. South Korean automaker Kia says that its new EV models include advanced heat pumps, which extract heat from the outside air, even in cold weather, and transfer it to the cabin, leaving the EV with more energy available for driving.",
      "Other EVs with heat pumps include the Acura ZDX and Volvo EX40, according to a list\u00a0published by electric-vehicle research firm Recurrent.",
      "How do EV owners in cold-weather places cope?",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

    "summary": "JPMorgan Chase says President Trump's lawsuit \"has no merit.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sued JPMorgan Chase Bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon for $5 billion in Florida, Thursday, alleging that the bank had closed his accounts in 2021 \"as a result of political and social motivations.\"",
      "The suit, filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County, claims that Mr. Trump and his hospitality companies \"suffered considerable financial harm and losses\" in early 2021 when he and his companies were debanked, because of what the suit called JPMorgan Chase's \"woke beliefs.\" Debanking occurs when financial institutions refuse to work with individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, Alejandro Brito, alleged the debanking had a \"devastating impact\" on the ability of Mr. Trump and his businesses to transact and access assets, and caused \"extensive reputational harm by being forced to reach out to other financial institutions in an effort to move their funds and accounts, making it clear that they had been debanked by JPMC.\" The president's companies were given notice in February 2021 they should take their business elsewhere, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit also alleges that Mr. Trump, his family, and businesses were blacklisted by the bank. It claims JPMorgan Chase urged other financial institutions \"to not carry on business relationships,\" with them, forcing the Trumps and their businesses to accept a \"limited menu of options and less advantageous terms\" at other banks.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said the suit is meritless.",
      "\"While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,\" a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. \"We respect the president's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves \u2014 that's what courts are for.\"",
      "\"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons,\" the bank added. \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking sector.\"",
      "The suit was filed the same day the president left the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Dimon also spoke.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the threat of a lawsuit over the weekend. On Saturday, he said in a post on Truth Social, \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"",
      "Debanking has been a focus for the administration for months. In August, the president signed an executive order that alleged that \"financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals' and businesses' access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\" It also directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate the matter.",
      "The OCC's preliminary report, issued in December, said it had found early evidence that nine of the biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 had improperly refused to do business with a range of industries. The six-page report did not identify clients who had been debanked or the institutions alleged to have engaged in the practice.",
      "\"While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy,\" the comptroller of the currency said in a statement. \"The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.\"",

    "summary": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicts that first-quarter economic growth will heat up to 5%. But sustaining that pace won't be easy, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Trump administration officials are forecasting a boom for the U.S. economy in 2026, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and historically large tax refunds.",
      "\"This quarter \u2014 the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 the United States of America's $30 trillion economy will exceed 5% growth,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox Business on Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By the end of 2026, he added, \"You're going to see 6% growth from the United States of America.\"",
      "That would mark the fastest economic growth since late 2021, when the economy grew at a blistering 7% annual pace after many businesses started reopening during the pandemic. Outside of a few post-pandemic statistical outliers, economic activity in the U.S. has historically moved at a far more measured pace, typically averaging between 2% and 3% per quarter on an annualized basis.",
      "As outlined by Lutnick, the U.S. economy could get a lift this year if President Trump appoints a new Federal Reserve chair more inclined to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate, a move that could spur growth. Consumers could also have more money in their pockets from larger tax refunds under the Republicans' tax and spending law, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's possible \u2014 I would say it's even likely on a one-off basis,\" Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at financial services company Truist, told CBS News of Mr. Lutnick's forecast. But he added that maintaining that growth for a full year is \"a really tough hill to climb.\"",
      "That's because a number of economic headwinds are likely to persist into 2026 and could blunt any lift from lower borrowing costs and larger tax refunds, Skordeles said. Those include trade tensions stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, as well as business uncertainty driven by the administration's shifting economic policies.",
      "\"Those are not positives for the economy,\" Skordeles told CBS News. \"One of those reasons why we're not growing faster is uncertainty.\"",
      "Truist forecasts 2.3% economic growth for all of 2026, while projections by other Wall Street economists range from 2% to 2.5%.",
      "A White House official pointed out that Lutnick's forecast is in line with the Atlanta Fed's forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%.",
      "Risk of overheating",
      "The latest readings on the U.S. economy show a jump in growth, with third-quarter GDP expanding at a 4.3% annualized rate, according to recent government data.",
      "On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is \"likely accelerating,\" citing an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tool that pegs fourth-quarter GDP growth at 5.4%. The Commerce Department will announce fourth-quarter growth data on Feb. 20.",
      "Yet there are risks to boosting the economy through interest-rate cuts and bigger tax refunds. Those same catalysts contributed to the searing inflation that drove the Consumer Price Index to a 40-year high in 2022.",
      "\"What the secretary was intimating earlier today, to me, that doesn't unlock a bunch of growth \u2014 it unlocks a bunch of inflation,\" Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundworks, a liberal-leaning think tank.",
      "Inflation still isn't down to the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate, with the December CPI showing that prices rose at a 2.7% annualized rate. Food prices remain elevated, rising at an annual pace of 3.1% last month due to sharply higher costs of staples like beef and coffee.",
      "\"It's not a single silver bullet that if we just lowered the [Fed's interest] rate, it would make everything magically better,\" Skordeles said. \"You start giving these tax incentives, and you put more money in people's pockets \u2014 it's the classic 'too many dollars chasing too few goods'.\"",
      "Would workers benefit?",
      "Consumers remain generally dour about the U.S. economy, with recent CBS News polling finding that Americans want Mr. Trump to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "\"Lower-income households have experienced weaker wage growth in 2025, while inflation has steadily eroded their checking and savings balances,\" analysts with PNC Economics Research said in a report this week.",
      "While a stronger economy can translate into higher wages in many industries, workers are taking home a smaller slice of the economic pie. The labor share of the nation's GDP slid to its lowest point since 1947, dropping to 53.8% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Even sharply higher economic growth might not do much to assuage public frustration with the cost of food, rent and other affordability issues, Pancotti said, pointing to the example of the strong post-pandemic growth under President Joe Biden. While GDP grew at a 7% pace for two quarters in 2021, Americans were more focused on pocketbook issues such as higher grocery and housing costs, she added.",
      "\"Joe Biden had [strong GDP growth], and yet his marks on the economy were low, given that people want lower prices,\" she added. \"They want to be able to afford their grocery bills and send their kids to summer camp.\"",

      "Consumer spending patterns underscore those disparities. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for nearly half of all U.S. consumer spending, according to Zandi's analysis of Federal Reserve data.",
      "The growing divide is being driven in part by surging stock prices, Zandi said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:34:55 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",
      "The banking industry has opposed the cap, saying it would limit consumers' access to credit and steer them toward riskier lending products.",

      "The two have publicly sparred after O'Leary said he would not install WiFi gear from Starlink, the Musk-owned maker of satellite internet gear, on Ryanair planes out of concern that the extra weight from the system's antennas would drive up fuel costs.",
      "\"It is a terrific system. It works very well,\" O'Leary said.\u00a0 \"The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost of that of about $200 million, $250 million a year, including the cost of installation and then the fuel drag.\"",
      "Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's SpaceX company developed Starlink to provide internet connectivity, launching its first batch of satellites in 2019.",

      "O'Leary said Wednesday that Ryanair had explored equipping its jets with Starlink's service, including meeting with executives from the telecom company, but ultimately rejected the idea.",
      "After O'Leary relayed that decision last week, Musk said on social media that the airline leader was \"misinformed.\" O'Leary subsequently told an Irish radio station that \"I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk, he's an idiot.\"",

    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "For a worker earning $65,000, a 3.5% annual raise would amount to an additional $2,275 a year.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-10-percent-credit-card-rate-cap-banks-january-20/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:01:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "By contrast, financial pros predicted the 10% cap would have little effect on higher-income bank customers.",
      "\"Americans who have investments and stable jobs aren't the ones with credit card debt. If you make $100,000, plus you're saving with a 401k, those clients will be largely unimpacted by this,\" Nick Holeman, director of financial planning at wealth advisor firm Betterment.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

      "Indianapolis-based Crew Carwash scored the top spot on Glassdoor's 100 Best Places to Work in 2026. Crew, a family-owned business that last year earned the second spot on the list, employs about 1,000 part- and full-time workers across its 55 locations in the Midwest.",
      "Glassdoor bases its rankings on insiders' takes on criteria that can determine a\u00a0good job, ranging from opportunities for career growth to satisfaction with compensation and benefits. Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",
      "Tech companies losing dominance",
      "Although tech companies remain the best-represented industry on the list, taking 24 spots, they appear to be losing their luster among workers. That number is down from 26 spots in 2025 and 31 in 2024.",
      "\"This is part of an ongoing trend where many tech employers are trimming some of the things that made the job so appealing over the last year,\" Zhao said. \"They are pushing harder and harder on efficiency and productivity.\"",
      "To be sure, \"there is still an enormous career and income upside, and you see that reflected in chipmaker Nvidia ranking third,\" he said.",
      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",
      "Only two companies have made the list for each of the 18 years Glassdoor has released the rankings: Bain & Company, which ranked No. 8 in 2026, and Google, which stands at No. 11 this year.",
      "Some white-collar employers are also dropping off the list, as some workers start to view blue-collar work as less likely to be supplanted by AI, Zhao said.",
      "\"There is still a balance with many industries represented,\" Zhao said. \"But it is reflective of the overall trend in the job market where we are seeing hiring freeze up in white-collar industries.\"",

Tim Walz spoke to the press Sunday afternoon, one day after 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis \u2014 the third shooting this month amid Operation Metro Surge, and the second fatality carried out by federal immigration enforcement forces.",

If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation. We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget.

      "Opening remarks",
      "I had the privilege of talking with Michael and Susan, Alex's parents, yesterday and the heartache in the hours after your son's murdered in front of the world is one thing, but what stood out to me was a parent's desire and their passion to make sure that the story of Alex was told.",
      "Someone who went to work to care for veterans, someone who was a valued co-worker, someone who relished and lived in this state in a big way whether it was outdoor activities or being down there on the street as a First Amendment witness to what ICE is doing to this, to this state.",
      "So, once again to Michael and Susan, when I talk to these parents, it's always in deep confidential conversation. In this one, though, Michael was very clear to me. He said, \"Don't let them forget Alex's story.\"",
      "The world knows how he died. He died at the hands of ICE agents on the streets of Minneapolis. They want us to make sure we said how he lived. So to Michael and Susan, our deepest sympathies, but you have my commitment to continue to tell that story.",
      "So now we've got two Minnesotans dead, we didn't have time to start telling [Renee Good's] story of a poet and a mother and a bright spirit, and now we're telling Alex's story.",
      "So my question is, what's the plan, Donald Trump? What is the plan? What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state? If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation.",
      "We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget. We're angry, but we won't give up hope. And above all else, we are clearly unified. If it was the intention of Donald Trump to make an example of Minnesota, then I'm damn proud of the example that the world's seeing.",

We believe in peace, and we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person, and we're up here telling another story of a Minnesotan just trying to live their life without the interference.",
      "To Americans who are watching this right now, and I don't know, maybe you're watching it with curiosity, bewilderment, horror, scorn or sympathy. I've got a question for all of you: What side do you wanna be on?",
      "The side of an all-powerful federal government that can kill, injure, menace and kidnap its citizens off the streets? On the side of a nurse at the VA hospital who died bearing witness to such a government? Or the side of a mother whose last words were, \"I'm not mad at you\"?",
      "The sight of tens of thousands of peaceful citizens who showed up to march when the wind chill was 40 below because they love this state and they love this country.",
      "You're allowed to decide at any point that you're not with us anymore. If you voted for this administration, heck, even if you thought Operation Metro Surge was a good idea, sounded like the thing to do a month ago, you're still allowed to look at what's happening here in Minnesota and say, \"This isn't what I voted for, and this isn't what I want.\"",
      "I ask you not to stand by idly. Speak out, share what you're seeing to others and urge others to put politics aside. We're no longer having a political debate. We're having a moral debate.",

This isn't about how many people I can put on the street; it's about how many of these people, these ICE agents and whoever else was thrown into this unholy mess, how many Donald Trump can get out of here?",
      "Minnesotans, you've won the hearts and minds of people across this country, and you've done it through your peaceful, resolved defense of your neighbors and the Constitution.",

      "And you know what you saw, and then you heard the most powerful people in the world, certainly in this country \u2014 the president, vice president, Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem \u2014 narrate to you what you were looking at that this was a domestic terrorist, crazed, running at law enforcement with the intent to kill massive numbers of them, sullying his name within minutes of this event happening. And then closing the crime scene, sweeping away the evidence, defying a court order and not allowing anyone to look at it.",
      "I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America. If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.",
      "This has to be the moment.",
      "Your government here in Minnesota, I've made it clear I'm accountable for things that happen here, and I will take responsibility for that. Someone has to be accountable. Someone has to hold the final decision on this. And sitting behind a keyboard at 2 a.m. and besmirching a VA nurse and a son and a co-worker and a friend is despicable beyond all description.",
      "This is not \"we need to see both sides.\" This is not \"we need to wait for this.\" This is basic human decency. And at this point in time, I'm just asking try, for a moment, to set aside the political side of it and go back and ground in the humanity of this. This family has gone through enough, and to have the most powerful man in the world drag their dead son with absolutely no evidence and gaslight the entire country? This is enough.",
      "And I would say, President Trump, you can end this today. Pull these folks back. Do humane, focused, effective immigration control. You've got the support of all of us to do that, let our law enforcement continue to do what they do, making Minnesota one of the safest states in the country, one of the best places to live. Allow our children to go back to school. We have got children in Minnesota hiding in their houses, afraid to go outside.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that Democrats will not put up the necessary votes to advance a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of immigration agents shooting and killing a man in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling \u2014and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"I will vote no. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"",
      "The House on Thursday passed a funding package, along with a separate measure to fund DHS, sending the bills to the Senate for approval, along with two other funding measures that passed the House last week.",
      "In the Senate, the DHS funding measure was expected to be packaged with the other legislation that funds key federal departments in hopes the Senate passes the measures together before the Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government.",
      "To advance the legislation, Republicans will likely need eight Democrats to vote for the legislation, since Sen. Rand Paul has generally voted against appropriations bills. If the funding package does not pass the Senate, there will be another partial government shutdown.",
      "But on Sunday, Schumer called for the six-bill funding package to be broken up, allowing the Senate to pass the non-DHS portions \"while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.\"",
      "Schumer's comments come after a Border Patrol agent\u00a0shot and killed a 37-year-old man in south Minneapolis Saturday morning. Saturday's shooting comes after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7 in South Minneapolis as well. Both victims are American citizens, and video of both incidents have spread quickly online.",
      "Family identified the victim in Saturday's shooting as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care nurse living in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference that the man who was killed \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers while they were conducting \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operations, with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Noem said officers attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.\"",
      "Nevada Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were two of the eight Democrats\u00a0who voted against their party to end the 43-day government shutdown last year, both said Saturday that they will not support the measure funding DHS. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, another one of those eight Democrats, already said Friday he would not support funding DHS.",
      "Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and had consistently voted to keep the government open during the last shutdown, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he would not vote to fund DHS.",
      "\"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances \u2014 what they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis,\" he said.",
      "King suggested separating out DHS funding from the rest of the appropriations package to avoid a shutdown. \"If those bills passed, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King added.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Saturday evening she \"will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.\"",
      "Several other Democratic senators on Saturday did not support funding DHS, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Mark Warner of Virginia, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Andy Kim of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Murphy and Padilla, along with a small group of Democratic senators, have spent the past two days calling colleagues to whip opposition to the DHS funding bill, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.",
      "Senate Democrats are expected to hold a caucus call on the issue Sunday evening, a source told CBS News.",
      "Although several House Democrats supported the bills to fund the government, prominent House Democrats on Saturday called on the upper chamber to reject the bill.",
      "\"DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York posted on social media Saturday.\u00a0 \"They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO.\"",
      "And Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, in a debate Saturday in the race for the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, reasserted that she \"absolutely voted against\" funding DHS.",
      "\"There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization that is going out and is violating people's rights every single day on American cities,\" Crockett said.",
      "A handful of Republicans in Congress also spoke out following the shooting.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington likewise said he's \"disturbed\" by what he's seen in Minnesota, while lauding the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee for seeking testimony from ICE leaders and other officials.",
      "The deadly Minneapolis shootings have occurred amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city in recent weeks. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday that the state \"has had it,\" and he called on the Trump administration to pull ICE agents from Minneapolis, characterizing their efforts an \"absolute abomination.\"",
      "The Trump administration has deployed 3,000 federal agents from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection throughout Minnesota as part of \"Operation Metro Surge.\" Tensions between the federal agents and residents are high, especially after the Jan. 7 shooting and an altercation after an ICE officer shot a Venezuelan migrant in the leg last week.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Thursday in Minneapolis that many of those officers are not even doing targeted immigration enforcement, but instead are stepping in to protect ICE officers from clashes with protesters. He blamed a \"failure of cooperation\" by local and state authorities for the rising tensions.",
      "On Friday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of the Twin Cities to protest Operation Metro Surge, and hundreds of businesses closed in solidarity.",

      "Washington \u2014 Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said Sunday that he won't vote for a package to fund the government if it includes funding for ICE, as lawmakers scramble to pass a slate of funding bills to stave off a partial government shutdown by Friday \u2014  but he argued that \"we don't have to have a shutdown.\"",

      "So far, six of the 12 appropriations bills have been passed by Congress and signed into law. The Senate has until Friday, Jan. 30 to approve the final six bills, which have been packaged together, after they passed the House in recent weeks. That package includes a bill that would fund DHS until the end of the fiscal year. If those final six bills aren't passed by the Senate and signed by President Trump by Friday, the agencies that they cover will begin to shut down.",

      "\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"",
      "Schumer urged Republicans to \"work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.\"",
      "King, who caucuses with Democrats, was among a trio of senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year.

      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened.",
      "Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened.",
      "Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a \u2013 in a law enforcement-involved shooting just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims.",
      "Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are \u2013 are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that, while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That is the state agency that investigates use-of-force incidents.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are separate from your police force.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves.",
      "I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.",
      "So I think, very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that, at the time of the shooting, it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just \u2013 there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already \u2013 the impression is left?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: People have had enough.",
      "This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone.",
      "And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: We understand that, for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him.",
      "You said that Pretti \u2013 you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any \u2013 any evidence that I have seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we checked. The Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun.",
      "\"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"",
      "The FBI director said: \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\"",
      "Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm. And there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions.",
      "He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, that \u2013 what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police-involved shootings, from the scene.",
      "So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines. But \u2013 but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance. If someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry, the only question would be if they were using the weapon in a \u2013 for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities.",
      "The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job.",
      "About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there.",
      "We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3,000, as we understand it.",
      "The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that, if those policies weren't in place \u2013 these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations \u2013 that none of this would really be happening.",
      "How do you respond to that claim that, because of these sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades.",
      "And it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail. That's at the county level. And the prisons are at the state level.",
      "So we are complying with the law, as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the Guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes, I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard.",
      "As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin-stretched as it is, and we have a job to do trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. attorney's office who had resigned.",
      "We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is local law enforcement experiencing, beyond your officers, but in the U.S. attorney's office, in your local FBI?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I mean, the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city.",
      "We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so \u2013 it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away, because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-Louisiana): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself.",
      "You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours. And your fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy said: \"The events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job.",
      "They're \u2013 look, we are all \u2013 just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago.",
      "They have chaos, it seems like, all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And so I wish yesterday didn't happen.",
      "What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "When we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans, I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis \u2013 and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting \u2013 four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin.",
      "And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leaders' fault. But, at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so they have made a decision not to assist ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was talking about the federal response. He was talking to dealing with the federal issues, because, when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76 percent, homicides down 67 percent, burglary down 39 percent year to date, sex offenses down, robberies down.",
      "Motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response \u2013 the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, but, remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down.",
      "And we're seeing that across the country. ICE \u2013 look, again, any time something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret.",
      "The law says you can't be here illegally. And, if you're committing violent crimes \u2013 the president made it clear \u2013 in fact, he was elected, President Trump was elected\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 to get rid of criminals in our communities; 416,000\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because, undoubtedly, the president was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it.",
      "But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe. Almost two-thirds of Americans say they dislike the president's approach to his deportation program.",
      "There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community, yes or no, what do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out.",
      "And, in fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see, by the way, people going in the streets, breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment.",
      "When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign,\" do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a conceal-carry permit. It's worked very well there.",
      "I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know, in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime. And interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities.",
      "You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting that they were unlawful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents, throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. He wasn't talking about the victim, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: So, let's tone this down.",
      "And leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz, said they're Gestapo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to \u2013 yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. And Maine Independent Senator Angus King is standing by.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION,\" and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.",
      "Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things. Among them, giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs.",
      "What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistleblowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota. And these are stealing programs from learning center, from disabled students programs that are being stolen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And the governor did nothing about it. And obviously we're investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But voter registration logs? As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand over voter registration logs? Like, what's the purpose of that? To end ICE enforcement?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know \u2013 I know we're trying, in Congress, to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standards, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show picture I.D. Those are things we're pushing for. That's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, non-citizens cannot vote.",
      "But I want to ask you, ICE \u2013 about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said its officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, let's \u2013 let's keep in mind that the five-year-old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually protected the child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which the family and \u2013 the family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum. That's \u2013 they don't like the app he used to file for asylum. And they dispute that he fled.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, Joe Biden \u2013 Joe Biden allowed millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret. People from prisons in other countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're retroactively trying to change the legality of his status.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: President Trump was elected \u2013 the number one issue last year was President Trump saying I'm going to secure the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. And 416,000 criminals have \u2013 illegals have been arrested by ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By \u2013 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Forty-seven percent of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions, 47 percent.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By the way, ICE just put up a website \u2013 not ICE, Homeland Security, Worst of the Worst DHS. Go Google Worst of the Worst DHS. State by state they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state. You can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam, or the two-year-old who was separated from her mother.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: That father was here illegally and abandoned his child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up, 416,000 people with violent, criminal records.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: These are people \u2013 and, by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: In part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. And 416,000 of them removed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And I don't think \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They do indeed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And local law enforcement \u2013 local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. It's a felony to interfere with law enforcement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot. And that's why we are asking the questions about taxpayer funded federal \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Yes. And we don't have that chaos in other cities. Minneapolis has its own problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Failed leadership that has led to a lot of this. And it's unfortunate it happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I wish it didn't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're \u2013 we're talk \u2013 we're talking \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next \u2013 to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",
      "We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING (I-ME): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state ICE just launched this operation, Catch of the Day, which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants among others, targeting 1,400 criminal aliens who have, quote/unquote, terrorized communities in Maine.",
      "What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us.",
      "And by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established, they list 13 people in Maine. They concede that \u2013 or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are. I'm sorry, 87. My math is off.",
      "But the point is, this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the \u2013 and the \u2013 at the county jail. So, this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the president. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me I have to submit my questions in writing and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be \u2013 I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers.",
      "But this \u2013 here's the real problem, Margaret. The people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking \u2013 we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their \u2013 to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this. And it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these \u2013 by these heavy-handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of get to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully. One of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it \u2013 a job at the border.",
      "But they also point to sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like your \u2013 like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, you put your finger on it, Margaret, in the last interview. The question is not, should we enforce the law, should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals. The question is, how is it done.",
      "I did a little research this morning. Obama, during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals. But you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I have never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy-handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and we're having these incidents all over the country. So, it's not necessarily \u2013 you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last \u2013 the end of the last shutdown. But I can't vote for a bill that clues ICE funding under these circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. I \u2013 there's an easy way out, by the way. Leader Thune could separate \u2013 which is what they did in the House, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS.",
      "And, by the way, if those bills pass, 96 percent of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability. And that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's your path to avoid a shutdown.",
      "But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric. In Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement. They're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: I guess I technically would, but I \u2013 I don't \u2013 again \u2013 well, let me \u2013 let me put it in the words of the sheriff in Cumberland County, Maine, when they took one of his recruits. He called it \"bush league policing.\" And I think that sort of summarizes it. And there's no need for this overwhelming show of force.",
      "I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Again, armed people with masks and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: And intimidating protesters. That's not America.",
      "And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the \u2013 going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: These people are acting outside the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: They're ignoring our laws. And we just can't keep supporting that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right, Senator King, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In a speech at Davos last week, Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, never mentioned President Trump by name, but he rebuked his trade wars as coercion, and he suggested the U.S. has created a rupture in the world order.",
      "We spoke with the outgoing Canadian ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, on Friday.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): I \u2013 we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time that, you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is \u2013 are important, that looking out in \u2013 for each other in important ways is a number one priority. I think in some quarters Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through. I have no doubt about that. But it \u2013 yes, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have had a long career here in the United States deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump was asked about it January 13th. He said, \"I really don't care,\" in terms of renewing it. \"There's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here.\"",
      "Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, did broad consultations, national consultations with their business communities in particular on what \u2013 how that agreement works for them and really without exception the American comments back were, sure, we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit. But job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world.",
      "So, I think there \u2013 I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people and the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up. And they are saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago your prime minister was in Beijing and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented. And it's very difficult. So, that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values and stand up to China. That seems dead if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think \u2013 I think we have to put this in perspective. The agreement that we did with China a few ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely or almost exclusively designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So, over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products, and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from their \u2013 one of their primary markets, if not for some of them their primary market.",
      "And so we went to Beijing to reestablish market access for our farmers and our fisheries. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they reestablished market access for U.S. soy farmers and in exchange roll back some tariffs and fees. So, this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He got a standing ovation for this speech.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes, he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new, brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "MARK CARNEY, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Stop invoking rules based international order as through it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is, a system of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, that's a good question. I mean I think he laid out in his discussion, his speech his view of what is happening in our world. And it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stably and maximize economic reality. So, we're moving away \u2013 or economic benefits. And we're moving away from that and we have to \u2013 countries like ours have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles, we can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by, by everyone, if they commit to them.",
      "But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic. And we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies. And part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world in trade agreements, in investment relationships, and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump posted on social media that \"Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China.\"",
      "Yet, President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built but it's supposed to be missile, layered missile defense as I understand it.",
      "Do you know what he's talking about that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't. But what I can say about the Golden Dome is this. Canada is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defense systems. And a big part of that is arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over the horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive.",
      "So, that is part \u2013 and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug into the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems where we're interoperable, we work together. We make our investments that make sense or Canada in defending our territory and defending our sovereignty. But we work with the Americans and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense but you're on board to help do that?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO because you're also a partner at NATO.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The only time that NATO's Article V was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan.",
      "Here's what President Trump said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did. They stayed a little back. A little off the front lines.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check, and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014, 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action.",
      "What does a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done. And I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true. And that's what matters.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi is pushing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to let the federal government access the state's voter rolls and public assistance data, as tensions flare in Minneapolis after a second person was shot Saturday by federal immigration agents assigned to a weekslong crackdown in the city.",
      "In a three-page letter obtained by CBS News, Bondi also urged the state of Minnesota to scrap all \"sanctuary\" policies and \"cooperate fully\" with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including giving the agency access to all local jails and honoring federal agents' requests to detain people.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon responded with a statement Sunday saying: \"The answer to Attorney General Bondi's request is no.\"",
      "Simon called Bondi's letter \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,\" and said it followed \"repeated and failed attempts by the DOJ to pressure my office into providing the same data.\"",
      "The Trump administration has pressed for greater access to Minnesota jails and prisons for weeks, suggesting it may roll back immigration operations in the state if it had more power to go into detention facilities to pursue people accused of being in the U.S. illegally. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "Bondi said the federal government needs access to state voter roll data to \"confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.\" The Justice Department has pushed Minnesota and other states to provide voter registration data for months, suing Minnesota for access to the data last year \u2014 but the department typically hasn't tied that push to immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota in the past.",
      "And Bondi demanded that the state share records on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, so the federal government can \"efficiently investigate fraud,\" as the Trump administration focuses on alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota public assistance programs.",
      "In his response, Simon noted: \"Attorney General Bondi knows full well that the Governor has no formal role in managing our elections or maintaining our voter registration system. She is also well aware that this specific request is the subject of active litigation with our office.\"",
      "\"It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security,\" Simon added. \"More broadly, the federal government must end the unprecedented and deadly occupation of our state immediately.\"",
      "The governor's office reacted to the letter by urging the Trump administration to \"engage in a serious conversation about ending this federal occupation.\" In a statement Sunday, Walz's office sharply criticized the conduct of federal immigration agents, including Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and another shooting by a federal officer that killed Renee Good earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on Sunday that \"people have had enough\" after this weekend's fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by federal agents.",
      "Federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, on Saturday morning. The shooting came as protests have continued in Minnesota's largest city over a federal immigration enforcement surge. Earlier this month, Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, and a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg by ICE while allegedly trying to flee.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said agents were acting in self-defense while trying to disarm Pretti, while local officials have pushed back on the account.",
      "O'Hara said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that it's \"deeply concerning the things that are being said.\"",
      "\"This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city,\" O'Hara said. \"So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised.\"",
      "O'Hara added that \"the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks,\" O'Hara said.",
      "O'Hara added, \"People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again, and I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable,\" he said. \"This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Asked whether he is calling on ICE to leave Minneapolis, O'Hara said the problem isn't that \"enforcement is happening, it's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" O'Hara said.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference Saturday that Pretti was in possession of a gun and ammunition and alleged he assaulted officers. Asked whether he knows if the weapon was concealed or was brandished, O'Hara said, \"I don't have any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to help ICE officers. O'Hara called those claims \"deeply disappointing.\" He argued that local police are \"doing everything that we can to manage this chaos,\" but are vastly outnumbered by the thousands of immigration agents deployed to the city.",
      "Amid the conflicting narratives and tension between local and federal officials, O'Hara said the police department doesn't have \"any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened,\" adding that when officers responded to the scene of Saturday's shooting, \"our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting.\"",
      "\"I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us,\" O'Hara said.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and pointed to \"some failed local leadership,\" saying, \"you don't have these kinds of incidents in any other city\" with federal immigration enforcement operations.",
      "\"Look, we are all just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis, and this has happened over and over again,\" Scalise said. \"They let their city burn down years ago, they have chaos it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't.\"",

And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago. They have chaos, it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You don't- don't see these numbers either?-- .",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- and so, I wish yesterday didn't happen. What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though, when we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans. I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis, and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin. And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leader's fault. But at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so he- was made a decision not to assist ICE-- .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He was talking- he was talking to- dealing with the federal issues. Because when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76%, homicides down 67%, burglary down 39% year-to-date, sex offenses down, robberies down, motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response- the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, but remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down, and we're seeing that across the country. ICE- look again, anytime something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret. The law says you can't be here illegally and if you're committing violent crimes. The President made it clear, in fact, he was elected. President Trump was elected to get rid of criminals in our communities. 416,000 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because undoubtedly, the President was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it. But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe, almost two thirds of Americans say they dislike the President's approach to his deportation program. There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community? Yes or no? What do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out. In fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment. When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign.\" Do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a concealed carry permit. It's worked very well there. I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime and interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities. You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting, that they were unlawful. Yes, he actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents. Throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah, he wasn't talking about the victim --",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- So, let's tone this down. And-and leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric. I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz said they're Gestapo. He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota, offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things, among them giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs. What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor, but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistle blowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota, and these are stealing programs from learning centers, from disabled students, programs that are being stolen, and the Governor did nothing about it. Congress is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But voter registration logs?--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- Investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand- hand over voter registration logs like, what's the purpose of that to end ICE enforcement?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know- I know we're trying in Congress to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standard, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show a picture ID. Those are things we're pushing for that's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-citizens cannot vote. But I want to ask you ICE- about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said his officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Let's keep in mind that the five year old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --the family--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --protected the child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum, that's- they don't like the app he used to file for asylum.",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, Joe- Joe Biden allowed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And they dispute that he fled--.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But they are retroactively trying to change the legality of the status--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --people from prisons in other countries. President Trump was elected. The number one issue last year was President Trump saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Absolutely--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- I'm going to secure the border, and he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. 416,000--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --criminals- illegals have been arrested by ICE. 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people, by the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 47% of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions. 47%.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --ICE just put up a website. Not ICE, Homeland Security, worst of the worst DHS. Go Google worst of the worst DHS. State by state, they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state, you can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --or the two year old who was separated from her mother.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --that father was here illegally and abandoned his child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "LEADER SCALISE:\u00a0 --Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: 416,000 people with violent criminal records. These are people- and by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 in part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. 416,000 have been removed. Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No and I don't think--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They do, indeed--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: And local law enforcement, local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. That's a felony to interfere with law enforcement--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot, and that's why we are asking the questions--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Yeah, and we don't have that chaos in other cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -about the tax payer funded federal--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --Minneapolis has its own problems--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --failed leadership that has led to a lot of this, and it's unfortunate it happened. I wish it didn't happen. Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "This interview was recorded on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So a lot is going on in the relationship between our two countries. We are so deeply integrated here on trade, you buy more from the U.S. than any other country. We have the world's longest land border. We have shared defense interests through NATO, shared air defense with NORAD. Are we like in the middle of a divorce? Like, how do you describe the relationship?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- I- we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in- in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time, that you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is- are important, that looking out for each other in important ways is- is a number one priority. I think in some quarters, Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through, I have no doubt about that, but it's yeah, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, you know, Canada had agreed to join this Board of Peace that President Trump announced out at Davos, and then overnight Thursday, the president disinvited Canada. Is this kind of public snub interfering in the relationship, and- and what does that indicate to you about what this Board of Peace is that Canada had said it did want to be a part of?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "So we had expressed an interest in the Board of Peace a number of weeks ago, and essentially, a Board of Peace that is seeking to find peace, in particular, in Gaza and stability, is something that Canada was very much supportive of. The- the parameters of that Board of Peace had just really started to come out and- and our government was considering it, but hadn't- hadn't really made a decision. But I think that- that honestly, I think that the most important thing to say here, from the perspective of Canada, is that we have always and will always be promoting peace and stability and human rights around the world. We'll do it with our allies in various fora, at NATO, at the U.N. bilaterally with like minded countries. So we're not going to change that and- and we will give it our all in- in any fora that- that is available to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It- It's kind of now described as an alternative to the United Nations. Is that something you're comfortable with?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, we are deep supporters of the United Nations. We feel that it's, you know, it's not perfect, no large institution is, but having a place where the whole world can get together and express their views on issues that are important to the globe is vital. And as I say, NATO is vital, and we work with our EU counterparts and EU-Canada, you know, security discussions and in- in various other configurations. So probably all of these different fora are- are essential. The Board of Peace has yet to be fully, I think, understood, and we'll see- we'll- we'll see where that goes, but the outcomes are what matter to Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So your prime minister gave a national address on Thursday, and I understand he denounced authoritarianism and exclusion. He did not mention President Trump by name, but he did rebuke the claim that Trump made at Davos, that Canada lives because of the United States. You're talking about what people receive at home, everyone has local politics, so when something like that is said, do you fear that this is starting not just a spat, but this is like a generational split between our two countries, like, how are people receiving this at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, I think Canadians- Canadians know that Canada lives because of Canadians, because what Canadians do for Canada, and right now, that's where we're trying to focus our attention. By doing what- you know, focusing our attention on what we can control as a nation for ourselves and our own economy and our own security and our own relationships around the world. The United States is always going to be a vital partner. Geography, as you said in your opener, 5,500 miles of border, deep ties, millions of Canadians and Americans that work together every day, that- that you know, do research and study and have families across the border so that- that is there, and that is something that I actually think brings strength to the relationship at times where, you know, in other- at other levels, and maybe at the political level, it- it's more complicated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It's very complicated. I mean, it- it's almost unthinkable that a phrase like authoritarianism and exclusion that that could be thought to be referring to the leader of the president of the United States?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, I think that there are concerns globally for- by our government, that we have institutions and norms, rules that have governed our countries, yours, mine, and all like minded countries for generations that are really being tested, really being tested. And- and I think what matters is how we react in the face of these tests, and for us, for our country, for our prime minister, you know, there are important implications for our country. And he's- he's trying to articulate a vision. And I think he is articulating a very strong vision for how we must adapt. And again, it's- it's about being pragmatic and principled, and that's- that's what we're going to continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You have had a long career here in the United States, deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration. President Trump was asked about it, January 13. He said, I really don't care in terms of renewing it, there's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here. Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico did broad consultations, national consultations, with their business communities in particular, on what- how that agreement works for them. And really without exception, the American comments back were sure we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit, but job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world. So I think there's- I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people in the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up, and they're saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So do you think there's a bilateral trade deal here? Is that what the Trump administration is going for, rather than the three way deal or--",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- you know, I think- I- I- we hear- we hear that sometimes, we hear different things. It is important to remember that even within that agreement, there are a lot of bilateral elements, but there is- there are advantages to doing things trilaterally. There's a lot of supply chain movement that happens between our three countries. And if you, if you break it into two, you could have different rules and disconnects there that are inefficient for business. So we're driven- look, Canada will be driven by what the best thing to do is, as I say, for the companies and constituencies that are relying on that agreement to create jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean, these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago, your prime minister was in Beijing, and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented, and it's very difficult. So that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean, the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values, and stand up to China. That seems dead, if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well, I think- I think we have to put this in perspective. The- the agreement that we did with China a few weeks ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely, or almost exclusively, designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from one of their primary markets, if not for some of them, their primary market. And so we went to Beijing to re-establish market access for our farmers and our fishers. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they re-established market access for U.S. soy farmers, and in exchange, rolled back some tariffs and fees. So this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But even Ontario's premier said this is letting Chinese \"spy cars\" into your country. I think he means electric vehicles that will be cheaply made in China. Are you worried about becoming too beholden to China and its cheap manufacturing?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, we're not, because, we- the- the auto side of this agreement was again to take us back to 2023, we had the importation of vehicles made in China. Many of those were Teslas, as a matter of fact, and we've gone back and stuck to the level of 2023 for those imports. So this isn't a revolutionary new thing. This is really just trying to roll back or de-escalate what had been escalated over the past year and a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, the treasury secretary is saying that Albertans are going to have a referendum on succeeding from Canada. He seems to be urging that. What do you make of this--",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and comments like that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: I think it's important to let Albertans and Canadians manage their own very delicate domestic, you know, politics themselves. I think that that's probably wise counsel. Having grown up in Alberta, you know, it's a- it's a- it's a province that has lots of strong views about the way in which it interacts with the rest of the country, as do other parts of our nation. And those are important debates to be had, but they're debates for our country to have within its own citizenry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems to be stirring the pot there a bit, but I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos. He got a standing ovation for this speech. He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "MARK CARNEY, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think he laid out in his- his discussion, his speech, his- his view of what is happening in our world. And it's- it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stability and- and maximize economic reality. So we're moving away our economic benefits, and we're moving away from that, and we have to- countries like ours, have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles. We can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by by everyone if they commit to them. But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic and we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies, and part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world, in trade agreements, in investment relationships and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sounds like Canada is picking off our friends.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I- no, I think Canada is trying to make sure that it is the most resilient it can be for our own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that President Trump posted on social media just a few moments ago that Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China. That's how it was described to me. Yet President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built, but it's supposed to be missile- layered missile defense, as I understand it. Do you know what he's talking about, that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't, but what I can say about the Golden Dome is this, Canada is- is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defens-, in our defense systems, and a big part of that is Arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over-the-horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive. So that is part- and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug in to the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Right. Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems, where we're interoperable. We- we work together. We make our investments that make sense for Canada and defending our territory and defending our sovereignty, but we work with the Americans and- and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in- in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense, but you're on board to help do that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO, because you're also a partner at NATO. The only time that NATO's Article 5 was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Here's what President Trump said.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.",

      "He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action. What is a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done, and I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true, and that's what matters.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara. Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF, BRIAN O'HARA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened. Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened. Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a, in a law enforcement involved shooting, just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims. Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are, are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is",
      "this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that is the state agency that investigates use of force incidents--",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They are separate from your police force.",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves. I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city. So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just- there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already- the impression is left?",
      "O'HARA: People have had enough. This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out. This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "O'HARA: We understand that for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening. It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening. These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him. You said that Pretti- you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any, any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we checked the Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "O'HARA: Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun. \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\" The FBI director said, \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\" Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm, and there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of, shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions. He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly. He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "O'HARA: Well, that- what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police involved shootings from the scene. So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines, but- but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance if someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry. The only question would be if they were using the weapon in a- for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities. The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job. About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there. We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3000 as we understand it. The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that if those policies weren't in place, these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations, that none of this would really be happening. How do you respond to that claim that because of the sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades, and it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail that's at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "O'HARA: Yeah. I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard. As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis Police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin stretched as it is, and we have a job to do, trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office who had resigned. We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good. What is local law enforcement experiencing beyond your officers, but in the U.S. Attorney's Office, in your local FBI?",
      "O'HARA: I mean the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city. We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so- it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.\u00a0 Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. ANGUS KING: Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state, ICE just launched this operation \"Catch of the Day,\" which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants, among others, targeting 1400 criminal aliens who have quote, unquote, terrorized communities in Maine. What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SEN. KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us- and by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established. They list 13 people in Maine. They concede that- or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are- I'm sorry, 87. My math is off. But the point is this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record, including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the at the- at the county jail. So this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the President. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me, I have to submit my questions in writing, and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be- I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers. But this- here's the real problem, Margaret, the people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking we're- we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets. Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their- to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this, and it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these- by these heavy handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of getting to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully, one of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it- job at the border. But they also point to Sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, you put your finger on it. Margaret in the last interview, the question is not, should we enforce the law? Should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals? The question is, how is it done? I did a little research this morning. Obama during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals, but you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I've never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from, the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and and we're having these incidents all over the country, so it's not necessary- you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and- and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SEN. KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last- the end of the last shutdown, but I can't vote for a bill that includes ace funding under the circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. There's an easy way out, by the way, Leader Thune could separate, which is what they did in the house, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS. And by the way, if those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's your path to avoid a shutdown. But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric in Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement, they're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: I guess I technically would, but I don't- again- well, let me, let me put it in the words of the sheriff in- in Cumberland County, Maine when they took one of his recruits, he called it 'bush league policing.' And I think that sort of summarizes it and- and there's no need for this overwhelming show of force. I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people. Again, armed people with masks and- and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing, and intimidating protesters. That's- that's not America. And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment. These people are acting outside the Constitution. They're ignoring our laws, and we just can't keep- keep supporting that.",

      "In his new memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light\" (to be published Tuesday by HarperCollins), Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro writes of his lifetime of public service, as well as the aftermath of the April 2025 arson attack on his home, and of the character of ordinary Americans \u2013 determined to build and strengthen community \u2013 who represent \"the bonds that lead to a more perfect union.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Josh Shapiro on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 25!",
      "\"Where We Keep the Light\" by Josh Shapiro",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Five months later, in the weeks following the arson attack on the Residence, as I sat in a pew at Salem Baptist Church, I felt a tap on my arm. It was a woman from the congregation who had been sitting in the pew across from me. She was in a baby-pink T-shirt and sweatpants and a matching baseball cap, suited up to join the other church ladies on a fitness walk after the service. She was in her seventies, at least, and greeted me with a smile. \"Governor, I've been praying for you,\" she said. I was touched, of course. \"We will take care of you like you took care of me all those years ago and lifted me up.\"",
      "She had tears in her eyes as she told me that seventeen years ago, when I'd served this district in the state House, we had met at a local event. Her husband had been sick, and she'd been having a hard time. They'd needed help with their medical benefits. I'd heard her, she said. I could see how down and out they had been. I'd told my team that they needed to figure out a way to get them what they needed, and we had. And now, here she was, in this church, at a difficult point in my life and for my family. She was here praying for me, lifting me up. I could feel the power of her prayers. The sense of connectedness to someone I hadn't really seen in many years.",
      "Those days after the attack on the Governor's Residence felt, at times, heavy and unrelenting, like we were wandering through the dark. And yet, as we navigated the challenges and shouldered the weight, what we remember most is not the hardness and the weight. What we carry forward are the moments like this. Because this light, it was all around us. We were overwhelmed by the outpouring from people all across this country whose shared humanity, shared sense of decency, shared agreement of what is right and what is wrong and of what our country should be and who Americans are at our core, overrides all of that.",
      "In days like that morning at Salem, or when I am in a synagogue or any place of worship, which is often in the course of my work, I find myself thinking more and more about William Penn. That he arrived on our shores in October 1682 aboard a ship named Welcome. His Pennsylvania would be a place that would be open to all people, grounded in free expression, freedom of religion, free elections, and respect for others. I think about my responsibility to carry this forward\u2014to go a few more miles in the journey Penn began, to build a place that remains warm and welcoming for everyone\u2014no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to.",
      "Now, I assume Penn could have never imagined a Governor who prays like me or a Lieutenant Governor who looks like Austin [Davius] in the land he once led. Or that he ever would have envisioned a world in which a Jewish Governor would host a giant iftar during Ramadan, obsess about needing more and bigger Christmas trees at the Governor's Residence in December, or host his son's bar mitzvah in the same spot where both of those expressions of other people's faiths took place. Though I do bet he'd be proud of how far we've come.",
      "His ideas of faith and his acceptance of others set in motion something that we need to find our way back to today. It's a foundational principle of this great nation. A band of patriots gathered at Independence Hall in 1776 to declare our independence from a king and set ourselves on a path of self-determination. Those patriots plotted, planned, and organized in taverns and town squares and decided that they wanted to live in a place grounded in the notion of real freedom and self-determination. And over the last two and half centuries, our American story has been defined by people from all walks of life who have followed that lead and done their part. Ordinary Americans rising up, demanding more, seeking justice, and working to build a better life for their children. The story of our nation has not been written just by people with titles next to their names or by people in government offices but by everyday folks believing in each other, standing up, raising their voices, and using their power.",
      "I've been privileged in my life to know those people\u2014the ones who will be in the history books and the ones I've written about in this book. The ones I feel blessed to know because they taught me something and helped me grow as a public servant, as a father, a husband, and a person, and brought me closer to my own faith.",
      "That is the American way. Those are the bonds that lead to a more perfect union. Those people, those bonds, that deeper connection to my faith are how I have learned to fish differently. To show up, to listen, to leave this place better than we found it. That's the cornerstone of my faith\u2014of all faiths, really. It's elemental, even as it is sometimes hard to see and feel today.",
      "This has been true at all the most significant moments in American history\u2014the commitment to doing the hard work required to have faith in these ideals and the people to perfect them. That is our shared story. It was true for our Founders at Independence Hall. It offered courage to the brave souls who wore our uniform and landed on foreign beaches to protect our freedoms here at home and defeat fascism abroad. It was on display when our neighbors, who sought a more perfect union, sat down at the lunch counter so the next generation could stand taller.",
      "I've witnessed this in the many millions of quieter moments of goodness, too. The way my father showed faith that new moms could tell him what they needed for their babies, not the other way around. The way my mother taught me to care about the world around me. In how the survivors of abuse found the courage to expose the truth. I've seen this with the dedication and bravery of the Hawbaker workers who were unafraid of corporate power. And with the law enforcement officers who care so deeply about their neighbors that they're willing to give their lives for the rest of us. I witnessed the fortitude of moms who lost their kids to fentanyl, who turn their pain into help for others; the craftsmen who wouldn't let an arsonist's crimes keep the people's home closed; the brave couples who pushed for marriage equality and moved the needle; the lady at Sheetz who got her husband the care he needed, along with thousands of others in dire straits; a community ravaged by an attack on their neighbors determined to show a capacity to love rather than succumb to hate.",
      "All those people and their actions and their belief in common good have propelled us forward, just like our Founders intended, and helped us find our faith in a brighter, better day. Ordinary folks doing extraordinary things each day to build a more just and connected nation. To not be consumed by darkness or chaos.",
      "Now more than ever, we yearn for and need a world defined by faith. It's universal, this belief in others to help us through what feels unsettled, uncivil, un-American. It's a guidepost, a path through the woods. When the dark feels like it could consume us whole and churn us up and lose us, it is where we keep the light.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:02:14 -0500",
    "summary": "In his memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" Pennsylvania's governor writes about how his childhood helped shape his lifetime of public service. He talks about the challenges he faced while growing up; the rise in political violence in America; and his future in the Democratic Party.",
    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says it's special to visit his longtime congregation, Beth Sholom Synagogue, in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park, which he's attended since he was young. He grew up coming here with his parents. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, a teacher and activist, inspired him into a life of service.",
      "But we learned it was also his mom's struggles with mental health that may have had the most impact on Shapiro. \"There were moments where a switch could be flipped, and there'd be a lot of yelling and a lot of chaos and a lot of tumult in the house,\" he said. \"And you would just want to retreat to your room and try and escape it all.\"",
      "In his new memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service\" (to be published Tuesday by HarperCollins), the 52-year-old governor details his childhood and his decades-long career.",
      "Shapiro writes that he had a happy childhood, and at points an unhappy childhood home \u2013 something he's never spoken about publicly. \"I wanted to share that, in part, because I know there's a lot of other families out there that go through this kind of stuff,\" he said. \"But in part, I want my mom to know that for as difficult as our childhood was at times, for as difficult as I imagine hers was, you know, she really set me on this path of service in a way that, you know, I hope she sees some of herself in, and I hope she takes pride in.\"",
      "Hard conversations",
      "The memoir begins with a deeply personal recounting of the arson attack on the governor's official residence in April 2025, while Shapiro and his family slept upstairs, hours after conducting a Passover seder.",
      "His son, Ruben, asked if someone tried to kill their family because they were Jewish.",
      "Shapiro said that conversation was really hard: \"We had to have some honest, tough conversations with our kids about what political violence is all about, and how it's designed to maybe target one person, but affect a broader swath of people based on a particular characteristic, perhaps in this case, our faith. And look, it's a hard thing for a parent to have that kind of conversation with their kids when they know in this business, they can't necessarily guarantee that level of safety.",
      "\"What I really hope for every day is that kids stop having to worry about that \u2014 not just my kids, but all people have to stop worrying that violence is gonna come to their community because of something they believe, or who they voted for, how they pray, who they love,\" he said.",
      "The arson attack occurred less than a year after Donald Trump, campaigning for president in Shapiro's state, had nearly been assassinated. I asked if political violence has changed how he carries out his work.",
      "\"I think political violence has gotten worse in this country since Butler,\" Shapiro replied. \"And I think it is only gonna get better when all politicians, all people condemn it universally, no matter who's the target of it, and no matter who carries it out. I don't care if you're a left-wing ideology, right-wing ideology; it should not be hard for us to say that it is all wrong.\"",
      "A new generation of the Democratic Party",
      "This year, Shapiro is in the middle of a re-election campaign, but he's also considered a top contender to represent the Democratic Party in 2028.",
      "We asked if the Democratic Party today has a clear set of ideals. \"I think the Democratic Party has a lot of clear ideals and wonderful values,\" Shapiro said. \"Otherwise I wouldn't be a member of this party.\"",
      "\"Are they articulating in a way, in a national message, that will win elections?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. I think folks are hoping that there will be one person every day, who's gonna go out and be the alternative to Donald Trump, or be the voice of the Democratic Party. And that one person certainly does not exist right now,\" Shapiro said. \"And that's okay, because there are wonderful Democrats who are governors, who are mayors, who are members of Congress, who are doing really good work every single day. And that work they're doing, I think, is helping shape and define the new generation of the Democratic Party.\"",
      "Right now, Shapiro is watching closely what's happening in Minneapolis with the president's immigration crackdown.",
      "\"The President claims it's all about safety,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"I think what the president's trying to do is show that he can be the dominant figure, that he can dictate behavior. Whether we're talking about Minneapolis or Greenland or Venezuela, this president wants to try and show what he believes to be strength that I think is a facade of strength and ultimately a veneer of strength. And ultimately what he's doing is making people worse off, less safe.\"",
      "What Governor Shapiro won't say is whether he will ultimately run for president himself. \"Here's what I can tell you with absolute certainty: I want to be a part of the dialog that helps shape us going forward into a party that can be one that helps people get a great education, that creates safer communities. I want to help build a Democratic Party that sees us as part of a world order, not going it alone. So yeah, I wanna be a part of shaping that dialog. And then ultimately from that dialogue that we have, there will be people who emerge, who ultimately want to lead that party. And that's a conversation for another day down the road.\"",

      "The 5-year-old immigrant boy taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement alongside his father in the Minneapolis area earlier this week has an active and pending case in immigration court and cannot be legally deported yet, according to government records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The ICE operation that led Liam Adrian Conejo Ramos and his father to be taken into government custody, captured on videos and photos that have gone viral, has garnered national attention and raised questions about who exactly the Trump administration is targeting in its mass deportation campaign.",
      "Justice Department records reviewed by CBS News indicate Liam and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, have immigration court cases listed as \"pending.\" The records by the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review do not list any deportation orders in either case, indicating that an immigration judge still must consider Liam and his father's claims before any deportation attempt. The information says the family's immigration court case was docketed on Dec. 17, 2024.",
      "CBS News was able to review the government information after obtaining the \"alien\" numbers issued to Liam and his father. Those \"A numbers\" are issued by the U.S. government to immigrants, illegal and legal alike, to internally track their deportation cases or immigration applications.",
      "Liam and his father are now being held at the Dilley detention center in Texas, ICE's long-term holding site for families with underage children, according to officials and the agency's detainee tracking system.",
      "Families at the Texas detention center held a protest there on Saturday, an attorney representing migrant children in federal immigration custody confirmed to CBS News. The attorney said the protest was peaceful in nature and involved some of the children holding signs.",
      "Representatives for Liam and his father say the family is from Ecuador and that they entered the U.S. in 2024 to request asylum. The family's lawyer said they were able to get an appointment to enter the U.S. at an official crossing site along the southern border, with the government's permission, through a Biden administration system that relied on a phone app called CBP One. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Friday the agency has \"no record\" of the family using CBP One.",
      "The Trump administration shut down the CBP One process immediately after taking office, and converted it into a self-deportation app now known as CBP Home. It also revoked the legal protections the Biden administration offered those who entered under the program, targeting some of them for arrest and deportation, including during immigration court appointments in cities across the U.S.",
      "The family's lawyer has said Liam's father does not appear to have a criminal record. DHS has called Liam's father an \"illegal alien\" and accused him of attempting to flee ICE officers, abandoning his son in the process. McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said Liam's father \"committed a federal crime by evading arrest.\"",
      "And while immigrants with pending claims cannot be legally deported, immigration officials do have the authority to detain them, if they're in the U.S. illegally or without a valid legal status, pending the adjudication of those cases.",
      "Prokosh Law LLC, the law firm representing Liam and his father, did not provide further information when asked about the family's immigration case.",
      "\"As their attorney of record, our primary concern at this time is Liam and Adrian's safety, well-being, and the work that is involved in getting them released from detention,\" the law firm told CBS News. \"While we do the relevant work to secure their release, we are unable to provide further information to the press.\"",
      "Dueling narratives about the arrest",
      "During a press conference in Minneapolis on Friday, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said his officers targeted Liam's father \u2014 not the child \u2014 during an arrest operation on Jan. 20. Charles said Liam was with his father inside a vehicle when ICE officers approached them.",
      "Charles said Liam's father tried to escape on foot, \"abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.\" He said an officer stayed with Liam, while others arrested his father. ICE officers \"cared for\" Liam and took him to a drive-through restaurant, Charles added.",
      "ICE officers tried to get Liam's family to take the child but the \"people inside refused to take him in and open the door,\" according to Charles. He noted his officers were \"heartbroken\" by the incident.",
      "Sergio Amezcua, a pastor who said he's spoken to Liam's mother, noted she \"was terrified\" during the incident.",
      "\"ICE agents were trying to use the baby for her to come out of her house,\" Amezcua said on CNN. \"But the neighbors step[ped] up. Neighbors advised her not to do it.\"",
      "On Friday, Charles said families held by ICE get \"top-notch care\" at facilities like the Dilley center in Texas, calling their treatment \"better than social services.\"",
      "\"They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation,\" Charles said.",
      "But advocates for immigrants have raised concerns about conditions at the Dilley facility. Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law, which represents migrant children in U.S. custody, said minors held at Dilley have experienced \"a dramatic decline in their physical and mental health.\"",
      "\"The current conditions at Dilley are fundamentally unsafe for anyone, let alone young children,\" Desai said. \"Since the re-opening of family detention, hundreds of families \u2014 including babies and toddlers \u2014 have been subjected to substandard medical care, degrading and harsh treatment and extremely prolonged times in custody.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America's northern neighbor went ahead with its trade deal with China.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a social media post that if Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"",
      "\"If Canada makes a  deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "While Mr. Trump has waged a trade war over the past year, Canada this month negotiated a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower import taxes on Canadian farm products.",
      "Mr. Trump initially had said that agreement was what Carney \"should be doing and it's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"",
      "Carney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president's push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance. Mr. Trump had commented while in Davos, Switzerland, this week that \"Canada lives because of the United States.\" Carney shot back that his nation can be an example that the world does not have to bend toward autocratic tendencies.",
      "Mr. Trump later revoked his invitation to Carney to join the president's Board of Peace that he is forming to try to resolve global conflicts. The president announced the move in a message to Carney on\u00a0Truth Social, saying the Board of Peace \"is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed the United States as a 51st state.",
      "He resumed that this week, posting an altered image on social media showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",
      "In his message Saturday, Mr. Trump continued his provocations by calling Canada's leader \"Governor Carney.\" Mr. Trump had used the same nickname for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and his use of it toward Carney was the latest mark of their soured relationship.",
      "Carney has not yet reached a deal with Mr. Trump to reduce some of the tariffs that he has imposed on key sectors of the Canadian economy. But Canada has been protected by the heaviest impact of Trump's tariffs by the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. That trade agreement is up for a review this year.",

    "summary": "The image, which an expert said was likely altered with AI, sparked backlash online. The White House doubled down, saying, \"The memes will continue.\"",
    "story": [
      "The White House posted a photo on social media that was digitally altered to make it look like a protester was sobbing as she was arrested in connection with a protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Minnesota church.",
      "A photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong's arrest \u2014 showing Armstrong with a neutral expression \u2014 was first posted on X by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday morning. The image the White House posted appears the same except Armstrong's altered facial expression shows her distressed, with tears running down her face.",
      "The White House posted the image of Armstrong seemingly crying with a caption calling her \"a far-left agitator,\" roughly 30 minutes after Noem posted the initial image. The altered version was also reposted on X by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The White House's post drew a flood of comments from X users, with many saying the image appeared to have been manipulated.",
      "In response to CBS News' request for comment on whether the photo was altered, the White House press office sent a link to an X post by White House spokesman Kaelan Dorr referring to the post as a \"meme.\"",
      "\"Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,\" Dorr said on X.",
      "Jordan Kushner, an attorney for Armstrong, called the image \"extremely offensive.\"",
      "\"It's a huge insult to try to make her out to be behaving in a way she didn't behave,\" he told CBS News. \"It's a huge injustice to her outside of the absurd changes they leveled in the first place. This whole prosecution is politically motivated. By posting a fictitious picture they are prejudicing the potential jury pool.\"",
      "Digital forensics expert Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California Berkeley and co-founder and chief science officer at GetReal Security, told CBS News that while it's not clear how the image was altered, it was likely edited with AI.",
      "\"This is not the first time that the White House has shared AI-manipulated or AI-generated content. This trend is troubling on several levels. Not only are they sharing deceptive content, they are making it increasingly more difficult for the public to trust anything they share with us,\" Farid said.",
      "The arrest of Armstrong and several fellow protesters came amid a wave of protests across the Twin Cities following the fatal shooting of\u00a0 Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month.",
      "Armstrong is a civil rights attorney and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP who helped lead a demonstration during a Sunday service at Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local ICE officer apparently serves as a pastor. Noem said Armstrong is being charged under 18 USC 241, a statute that prohibits the intimidation of someone exercising a Constitutional right.",
      "She is expected to be released after a judge rejected a request for a detention hearing.",
      "Two others, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly, were also arrested Thursday in connection to the Cities Church demonstration, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. But a magistrate judge refused to sign a complaint charging independent journalist Don Lemon in connection with that protest, multiple sources familiar with the proceedings told CBS News. Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was there \"engaging in constitutionally protected activity as a journalist,\" his attorney said in a statement.",

      "Jeffrey Epstein's inner circle, Les Wexner, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, were formally issued subpoenas Friday to testify before the House Oversight Committee, as key associates of the convicted sex offender.",
      "\"Oversight Democrats fought hard to get these subpoenas and forced the vote on Republicans. Now, the Committee will hear directly from the individuals most closely involved in Epstein's inner circle. We will not stop until we get answers,\" Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement.",
      "Indyke, Epstein's lawyer; Khan, his accountant; and Wexner, his billionaire financial client and longtime benefactor, were identified as critical to the investigation by Epstein survivors. Documents released in earlier lawsuits and among the recent U.S. Department of Justice trove show a complex and tangled relationship between Epstein and the three men.",
      "Daniel H. Weiner, an attorney for Indyke and Kahn, said in a statement to CBS News that the two accepted the subpoenas and intend to cooperate with the committee, but added that the allegations in the subpoena are \"false.\"",
      "\"It is worth emphasizing that not a single woman has ever accused either Mr. Indyke or Mr. Kahn of committing sexual abuse or witnessing sexual abuse, nor claimed at any time that she reported to them any allegation of Mr. Epstein's abuse,\" Weiner said in the statement. \"Indyke and Kahn did not socialize with Mr. Epstein, and they have always rejected as categorically false any suggestion that they knowingly facilitated or assisted Mr. Epstein in his sexual abuse or trafficking of women, or that they were aware of Mr. Epstein's actions while they provided legal and accounting services to Mr. Epstein.\"",
      "Indyke first began working with Epstein in 1986 at a small boutique law firm in New York City that handled Epstein's real estate deals. He later claimed Epstein as a mentor and was exclusively employed by Epstein by the 1990s. Indyke helped establish Epstein's corporate and personal base of operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands. He was involved in almost every aspect of Epstein's business and personal affairs and was paid millions of dollars for his services, according to court documents.",
      "Kahn also worked closely with Epstein, managing his finances and investments. He managed other minutiae for Epstein, such as renovations on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Indyke and Kahn recently settled a lawsuit alleging they facilitated Epstein's trafficking network. Court documents show they were accused of facilitating sham marriages between women Epstein was abusing for immigration purposes.",
      "Epstein worked with Wexner, a billionaire who founded The Limited clothing company, from the mid-1980s as his financial manager and had broad control over Wexner's fortune. They parted ways after Epstein's 2006 arrest but stayed in touch, documents show.",
      "Attorney Brad Edwards, who has represented many of Epstein's victims, told CBS News: \"Epstein is dead. If anyone has questions they would ask of Epstein on any topic, those questions should either be directed to Darren, Rich or Leslie [Wexner].\"",
      "Epstein appointed Indyke and Kahn as executors of his will. They now control the estate.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Wexner for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",
      "The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed several figures in the convicted sex offender's network since last August, when former U.S. Attorney General William Barr testified about his pledge to personally lead the investigation into Epstein's death in a Manhattan detention center.",
      "In the months since then, various people have testified \u2014 while the panel has accepted written statements from others \u2014 with scant new information on Epstein released. On Wednesday, the committee recommended holding former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt after the pair refused to appear\u00a0in person before the Republican-led panel. The Clintons submitted sworn declarations to the committee last week.",

    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

School officials claimed the child was used by agents to knock on the door and ask to be let in, letting officers see if anyone else was home.",
      "As community outrage grew, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed that \"ICE did NOT target a child,\" and said he was instead abandoned by his father. They say his father fled federal agents as they approached his vehicle, leaving the child.",

      "\"For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended (the father),\" DHS officials said.",
      "School officials say a nearby adult on the scene offered to take the child, but ICE agents did not allow that.",
      "Later Thursday, McLaughlin went further, calling the framing of the incident as ICE using the child as \"bait,\" claims made earlier by the child's school district, were \"a horrific smear.\"",
      "\"Our officer's made multiple attempts to get the alleged mother who was inside the house to take custody of her child. Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody. The alleged mother refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him,\" McLaughlin said. \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement.\"",
      "An attorney for the Ramos family said they had entered the U.S. through a port of entry in 2024 using the CPB app and had requested asylum.",
      "\"Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they've been asked to do,\" Marc Prokosch, the family's lawyer, said of the family's asylum claim. \"So this is just cruelty.\"",

It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",

      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump stepped back on Wednesday from his insistence that the United States needs to \"own\" Greenland to ensure U.S. national security.",
      "After talks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he dropped his threat to impose tariffs against eight of America's closest allies and then said the framework of a plan to resolve his administration's standoff with Europe had been reached.",
      "Mr. Trump called it an \"ultimate long-term deal\" on Greenland, saying it's \"really fantastic for the USA, gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security.\"",
      "But he offered few details. Here's what we know about where negotiations stand:",
      "In his speech at the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump took U.S. military intervention to seize control of Greenland off the table.Mr. Trump then met with Rutte and, afterward, said they had come up with \"the framework of a future deal.\"Mr. Trump took his threat to impose 10% tariffs on all imports from eight European allies off the table.Rutte told Reuters the framework deal agreed with Mr. Trump would require NATO to step up on Arctic security, but that Greenland's mineral resources had not been discussed.A NATO spokesperson said Rutte's meeting with Mr. Trump was \"very productive,\" and the framework the president referred to would focus on collective allied efforts to ensure Arctic security.The NATO spokesperson also said negotiations between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland would continue, to ensure that neither Russia or China get a military or economic foothold in Greenland.U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new framework could include a new NATO \"Arctic Sentry\" security partnership.",

      "U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new framework could include a new NATO \"Arctic Sentry\" security partnership.",
      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said, \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.",
      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "Would Trump use military force to take Greenland?",

      "\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But, I won't do that. Okay?\" he said in his address on Jan. 21. \"Now everyone's saying 'oh, good.' That's probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke to the press Sunday afternoon, one day after 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis \u2014 the third shooting this month amid Operation Metro Surge, and the second fatality carried out by federal immigration enforcement forces.",
      "\"What's the plan, Donald Trump? What is the plan?\" Walz said. \"What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state? If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation. We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget. We're angry, but we won't give up hope. And above all else, we are clearly unified.\"",
      "Walz said if President Trump's intention was to \"make an example of Minnesota,\" it backfired.",
      "\"We believe in law and order in this state. We believe in peace, and we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person, and we're up here telling another story of a Minnesotan just trying to live their life without the interference,\" Walz said. \"To Americans who are watching this right now, and I don't know, maybe you're watching it with curiosity, bewilderment, horror, scorn or sympathy. I've got a question for all of you. What side do you wanna be on?\"",
      "Full transcripts of Gov. Walz's opening and closing remarks",
      "Opening remarks",
      "I had the privilege of talking with Michael and Susan, Alex's parents, yesterday and the heartache in the hours after your son's murdered in front of the world is one thing, but what stood out to me was a parent's desire and their passion to make sure that the story of Alex was told.",
      "Someone who went to work to care for veterans, someone who was a valued co-worker, someone who relished and lived in this state in a big way whether it was outdoor activities or being down there on the street as a First Amendment witness to what ICE is doing to this, to this state.",
      "So, once again to Michael and Susan, when I talk to these parents, it's always in deep confidential conversation. In this one, though, Michael was very clear to me. He said, \"Don't let them forget Alex's story.\"",
      "The world knows how he died. He died at the hands of ICE agents on the streets of Minneapolis. They want us to make sure we said how he lived. So to Michael and Susan, our deepest sympathies, but you have my commitment to continue to tell that story.",
      "So now we've got two Minnesotans dead, we didn't have time to start telling [Renee Good's] story of a poet and a mother and a bright spirit, and now we're telling Alex's story.",
      "So my question is, what's the plan, Donald Trump? What is the plan? What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state? If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation.",
      "We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget. We're angry, but we won't give up hope. And above all else, we are clearly unified. If it was the intention of Donald Trump to make an example of Minnesota, then I'm damn proud of the example that the world's seeing.",
      "We believe in law and order in this state. We believe in peace, and we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person, and we're up here telling another story of a Minnesotan just trying to live their life without the interference.",
      "To Americans who are watching this right now, and I don't know, maybe you're watching it with curiosity, bewilderment, horror, scorn or sympathy. I've got a question for all of you: What side do you wanna be on?",
      "The side of an all-powerful federal government that can kill, injure, menace and kidnap its citizens off the streets? On the side of a nurse at the VA hospital who died bearing witness to such a government? Or the side of a mother whose last words were, \"I'm not mad at you\"?",
      "The sight of tens of thousands of peaceful citizens who showed up to march when the wind chill was 40 below because they love this state and they love this country.",
      "You're allowed to decide at any point that you're not with us anymore. If you voted for this administration, heck, even if you thought Operation Metro Surge was a good idea, sounded like the thing to do a month ago, you're still allowed to look at what's happening here in Minnesota and say, \"This isn't what I voted for, and this isn't what I want.\"",
      "I ask you not to stand by idly. Speak out, share what you're seeing to others and urge others to put politics aside. We're no longer having a political debate. We're having a moral debate.",
      "We all want secure borders and immigration enforcement that prioritizes criminals, and I want to thank the press, especially the local press, who has done a deep dive to show that's exactly what Minnesota does.",
      "But what you're seeing is not common sense, lawful or humane enforcement. That's not what this occupation is about.",
      "Let me say our conversation should not be about, and I know we get asked of what we're doing out there, how many state patrol or police or national guard I can put on the street. This isn't about how many people I can put on the street; it's about how many of these people, these ICE agents and whoever else was thrown into this unholy mess, how many Donald Trump can get out of here?",
      "Minnesotans, you've won the hearts and minds of people across this country, and you've done it through your peaceful, resolved defense of your neighbors and the Constitution.",
      "So once again, Minnesotans, stay peaceful, stay safe. Change is coming and we can feel it. But this fight still goes on.",
      "Closing remarks",
      "I'm going to close with one thing that I promised the parents, with Michael and Susan, and I speak to all Americans on this over these last 24 hours, what you saw, you're now knowing more about this young man, beloved by his family, accomplished ICU nurse, skillful ability to work with veterans, someone who is beloved by community, no criminal record, lawful firearms owner.",
      "And you know what you saw, and then you heard the most powerful people in the world, certainly in this country \u2014 the president, vice president, Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem \u2014 narrate to you what you were looking at that this was a domestic terrorist, crazed, running at law enforcement with the intent to kill massive numbers of them, sullying his name within minutes of this event happening. And then closing the crime scene, sweeping away the evidence, defying a court order and not allowing anyone to look at it.",
      "I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America. If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.",
      "This has to be the moment.",
      "Your government here in Minnesota, I've made it clear I'm accountable for things that happen here, and I will take responsibility for that. Someone has to be accountable. Someone has to hold the final decision on this. And sitting behind a keyboard at 2 a.m. and besmirching a VA nurse and a son and a co-worker and a friend is despicable beyond all description.",
      "This is not \"we need to see both sides.\" This is not \"we need to wait for this.\" This is basic human decency. And at this point in time, I'm just asking try, for a moment, to set aside the political side of it and go back and ground in the humanity of this. This family has gone through enough, and to have the most powerful man in the world drag their dead son with absolutely no evidence and gaslight the entire country? This is enough.",
      "And I would say, President Trump, you can end this today. Pull these folks back. Do humane, focused, effective immigration control. You've got the support of all of us to do that, let our law enforcement continue to do what they do, making Minnesota one of the safest states in the country, one of the best places to live. Allow our children to go back to school. We have got children in Minnesota hiding in their houses, afraid to go outside.",
      "Many of us grew up reading that story of Anne Frank. Somebody is going to write that children's story about Minnesota. And there's one person who can end this now.",
      "And I'll go back to it again. Please show some decency, pull these folks out, reset this situation and allow us to do the job that the attorney general and myself were elected to do: protect the people of Minnesota and carry out the laws of Minnesota.",

    "summary": "Sens. Chris Murphy and Alex Padilla have spent the past two days calling colleagues to whip opposition to the DHS funding bill, according to a source familiar with the process.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that Democrats will not put up the necessary votes to advance a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of immigration agents shooting and killing a man in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling \u2014and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"I will vote no. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"",
      "The House on Thursday passed a funding package, along with a separate measure to fund DHS, sending the bills to the Senate for approval, along with two other funding measures that passed the House last week.",
      "In the Senate, the DHS funding measure was expected to be packaged with the other legislation that funds key federal departments in hopes the Senate passes the measures together before the Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government.",
      "To advance the legislation, Republicans will likely need eight Democrats to vote for the legislation, since Sen. Rand Paul has generally voted against appropriations bills. If the funding package does not pass the Senate, there will be another partial government shutdown.",
      "But on Sunday, Schumer called for the six-bill funding package to be broken up, allowing the Senate to pass the non-DHS portions \"while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.\"",
      "Schumer's comments come after a Border Patrol agent\u00a0shot and killed a 37-year-old man in south Minneapolis Saturday morning. Saturday's shooting comes after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7 in South Minneapolis as well. Both victims are American citizens, and video of both incidents have spread quickly online.",
      "Family identified the victim in Saturday's shooting as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care nurse living in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference that the man who was killed \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers while they were conducting \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operations, with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Noem said officers attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.\"",
      "Nevada Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were two of the eight Democrats\u00a0who voted against their party to end the 43-day government shutdown last year, both said Saturday that they will not support the measure funding DHS. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, another one of those eight Democrats, already said Friday he would not support funding DHS.",
      "Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and had consistently voted to keep the government open during the last shutdown, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he would not vote to fund DHS.",
      "\"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances \u2014 what they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis,\" he said.",
      "King suggested separating out DHS funding from the rest of the appropriations package to avoid a shutdown. \"If those bills passed, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King added.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Saturday evening she \"will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.\"",
      "Several other Democratic senators on Saturday did not support funding DHS, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Mark Warner of Virginia, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Andy Kim of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California.",

    "summary": "A man is dead after a shooting in Minneapolis on Saturday involving federal immigration agents from Customs and Border Protection. Here's what we know so far.",
    "story": [
      "A 37-year-old man was\u00a0shot and killed in Minneapolis\u00a0by a Border Patrol agent Saturday morning, less than three weeks after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0in the city by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent.",
      "Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was killed Saturday around 9 a.m. local time in south Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the agent acted in self-defense while trying to disarm Pretti, but local officials pushed back on the account and condemned the ongoing federal immigration surge in their city. Bystander video showed Pretti holding a cellphone, not a gun, ahead of the shooting.",
      "Here's what we know about the shooting:",
      "Conflicting narratives emerge of what led up to the shooting",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun  while they were conducting \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operations. Noem said officers attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.\"",
      "Bystander videos reviewed and verified by CBS News shows Pretti was holding a phone in his right hand and nothing in his left before the shooting. Footage shows an altercation between several officers and a person on the ground before shots are heard.",
      "Multiple videos\u00a0show\u00a0a federal agent in a gray jacket reaching into the scuffle empty-handed and emerging with a gun in his right hand, then turning away from the man when the first shot is fired. That agent is then seen running across the street as numerous shots are fired.",
      "Noem said Pretti was carrying two magazines that each held dozens of rounds, and had no identification on him. When asked by CBS News whether Pretti \"brandished\" a firearm, Noem didn't address that, but alleged that he \"showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers.\" She said: \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"",
      "Local officials said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, and that his only previous interaction with law enforcement was for traffic violations. Under Minnesota law, it's legal to carry a handgun in public if you have a valid permit.",
      "Witnesses who said they were at the scene of the shooting contradicted the accounts by federal officials in sworn declarations submitted in federal court, court documents show. One witness, a Minneapolis resident, said Pretti was directing traffic before the altercation with agents began.",
      "\"The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera,\" the witness said. He also said \"agents pulled the man on the ground.\" The witness added: \"I didn't see him touch any of them.\"",
      "What we know about Alex Pretti",
      "Born in Illinois, Pretti was a U.S. citizen and worked as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS Minnesota, his family described him as a \"kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.\"",
      "His family told the AP that he had participated in protests following the\u00a0Good's killing\u00a0on Jan. 7.",
      "A neighbor described him to CBS Minnesota as someone who \"would always be willing to help others.\"",
      "Local leaders react with anger, frustration",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for an end to the federal operation in Minnesota. He said: \"I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans, need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?\"",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had reviewed several videos of the shooting, and he called the Trump administration's account of events \"nonsense\" and \"lies.\"",
      "\"What I see with my eyes and what you're going to see with your eyes makes that pretty hard to believe,\" he said.",
      "In a news conference Sunday, Walz said President Trump needs to pull federal agents out of the state \"before they kill another person.\"",
      "\"I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America,\" Walz said. \"This is an inflection point, America.\"",
      "\"This is not 'we need to see both sides.' This is not 'we need to wait for this.' This is basic human decency. And at this point in time, I'm just asking try, for a moment, to set aside the political side of it and go back and ground in the humanity of this.\"",
      "Lawyers for the city filed a declaration\u00a0based on witness accounts\u00a0of Saturday's shooting that seeks to encourage a judge to put a temporary restraining order on the surge of federal troops in Minneapolis.",
      "Federal probe underway, but unclear if state agencies will be involved",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud granted a temporary restraining order barring the Department of Homeland Security from altering or destroying evidence related to the shooting. The order, which was requested by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, was set to remain effective through Monday afternoon, at which point Tostrud could issue a ruling to potentially extend it.",
      "The judge's order came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the BCA, alleging that DHS mishandled evidence at the scene of the shooting and blocked them from accessing it, even through the bureau had obtained a judge's signed search warrant. In the lawsuit, the BCA wrote that \"contrary to long-standing procedures and accepted norms of state and federal cooperation, it appears federal authorities have taken exclusive possession of evidence from the scene.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the BCA said it\u00a0had withdrawn from the Good case\u00a0because federal authorities had restricted its access to evidence.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that a \"federal investigation is ongoing.\" Like other Trump administration officials, he blamed Democratic leaders for \"this avoidable tragedy,\" claiming they \"have resisted federal law enforcement and created this escalation.\"",
      "\"Federal officers are tasked with the difficult jobs of removing criminal illegal aliens from American communities,\" he said, adding that the Justice Department \"will continue to hold those breaking federal law accountable, including those who harass and violently attack law enforcement in the name of protest.\"",
      "Walz\u00a0posted to social media\u00a0that he \"told the White House the state must lead the investigation. Let state investigators secure justice.\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said that police have not been provided with \"any public safety statement around the incident, what happened,\" by federal agents.",
      "Protesters demonstrate at scene of shooting",
      "A group of protesters descended on the scene following the shooting, Noem said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin referred to protesters as \"rioters.\" Local law enforcement declared an unlawful assembly.",
      "Noem said protesters threw objects, \"and a rampant assault began, and even an HSI officer agent's finger was bitten off.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi later said a person had been arrested in the biting incident.",
      "Video footage from CBS Minnesota showed standoffs between protesters and federal officers. Airborne chemical irritants were discharged by officers, and whistling and shouting were audible on the video. Protesters were also seen setting up barricades of trash cans.",
      "Despite earlier chaos, O'Hara said at a late afternoon news conference that demonstrations throughout the city were currently peaceful and that his officers \"intend to keep it that way.\"",

      "\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public.

      "The southern part of the country will see accumulations of both ice and snow. Ice accumulations can be more dangerous than snow, officials warned. The weight of ice on power lines is more likely to cause outages. It is also harder to clear than snow and can make for dangerous driving conditions.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: As a paralyzing winter storm barrels through a vast part of the country, the standoff between federal law enforcement agencies and the Minneapolis community explodes following yet another deadly shooting of a protester.",
      "It's happened again. Minneapolis is the scene of the violent death of a protester at the hands of federal immigration agents. In this case, 37- year-old Alex Pretti was shot and killed Saturday morning outside a donut shop amid what federal officials say was an unrelated immigration operation led by Customs and Border Protection agents.",
      "Interpretations of the extensive videos of the shooting are mixed. And much like the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis just over two weeks ago, federal and state officials are at odds over what happened and why and who should investigate.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): They killed a man, created chaos, pushed down protesters, threw gas indiscriminately, and then left the scene, and then we're left to clean up.",
      "GREGORY BOVINO (Border Patrol Commander): This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will have a report from the scene and talk exclusively to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, then turn to the bigger picture, as Senate Democrats threaten to block funding for ICE and DHS agencies, while the public increasingly is wary of ICE actions and the subsequent pushback.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Maine independent Senator Angus King, whose home state is the site of ICE's new deportation operation called Catch of the Day. We will also talk with the outgoing Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman about the growing divide between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we come on the air, over 200 million Americans in 35 states from New Mexico to Maine are dealing with or preparing for the massive winter storm that is now moving across the country. There are already at least 700,000 people without power. Thousands of flights have either been canceled or are delayed.",
      "And there is a cold front moving in behind that storm, which will likely make the situation facing most Americans as this workweek begins even more treacherous.",
      "We turn now to the volatile situation in Minneapolis and the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen.",
      "CBS News correspondent Lana Zak reports.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "LANA ZAK (voice-over): Multiple cell phone videos captured the moments before 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed. In the footage, Pretti is seen wearing a baseball cap and holding a cell phone. Moments later, after a federal agent shoved and sprayed another person, several officers tackle Pretti.",
      "One appears to retrieve a gun and turn away. Then at least one other agent fires multiple shots, killing him.",
      "Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino defended the shooting, saying that CBP agents were conducting an operation involving a different man in the country illegally.",
      "GREGORY BOVINO (Border Patrol Commander): An individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a Border Patrol agent fired defensive shots.",
      "LANA ZAK: Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara says he sent local officers to the scene.",
      "BRIAN O'HARA (Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Chief): We believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "LANA ZAK: DHS officials released a photo of what they say is Pretti's gun.",
      "Did the 37-year-old who had a license to carry, did he brandish a gun? And at what point did law enforcement retrieve the gun and also the magazines from him? Can you offer clarity on where those were found?",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): This individual showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. They responded according to their training and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him.",
      "And I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition, rather than a sign. This is a violent riot when you have someone showing up with weapons and are using them to assault law enforcement officers.",
      "LANA ZAK: Several eyewitnesses dispute those claims. In a court affidavit, one resident testified \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I have read the statement from DHS about what happened and it is wrong. The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera. He was just trying to help a woman get up. And they took him to the ground.\"",
      "Another witness who self-identified as a pediatrician and after asking several times was permitted to perform CPR testified that \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I saw that the victim was lying on his side and was surrounded by several ICE agents. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice. Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.\"",
      "Alex Pretti was an ICU nurse with the Veterans Affairs' health system.",
      "In a statement, Pretti's parents say: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.\"",
      "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the video sickening.",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): This federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. It's a campaign of organized brutality.",
      "LANA ZAK: Pretti is the second U.S. citizen killed in Minneapolis this month in Operation Metro Surge. And the city of Minneapolis erupted in protests.",
      "We hear bottles being thrown. Some people have been taken away. We see somebody right over there now being apprehended.",
      "Throughout the day, protesters gathered even after it was declared an unlawful assembly\u2026",
      "(SHOUTING)",
      "LANA ZAK: \u2026 demonstrating their anger and grief.",
      "(End VT)",
      "LANA ZAK: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension say they have been locked out of this investigation.",
      "And, overnight, a Trump-appointed judge issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to preserve all evidence. That hearing is scheduled for Monday \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Lana Zak reporting from Minneapolis.",
      "We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara.",
      "Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "BRIAN O'HARA (Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Chief): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened.",
      "Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened.",
      "Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a \u2013 in a law enforcement-involved shooting just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims.",
      "Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are \u2013 are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that, while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That is the state agency that investigates use-of-force incidents.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are separate from your police force.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves.",
      "I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.",
      "So I think, very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that, at the time of the shooting, it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just \u2013 there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already \u2013 the impression is left?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: People have had enough.",
      "This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone.",
      "And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: We understand that, for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him.",
      "You said that Pretti \u2013 you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any \u2013 any evidence that I have seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we checked. The Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun.",
      "\"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"",
      "The FBI director said: \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\"",
      "Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm. And there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions.",
      "He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, that \u2013 what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police-involved shootings, from the scene.",
      "So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines. But \u2013 but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance. If someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry, the only question would be if they were using the weapon in a \u2013 for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities.",
      "The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job.",
      "About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there.",
      "We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3,000, as we understand it.",
      "The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that, if those policies weren't in place \u2013 these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations \u2013 that none of this would really be happening.",
      "How do you respond to that claim that, because of these sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades.",
      "And it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail. That's at the county level. And the prisons are at the state level.",
      "So we are complying with the law, as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the Guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes, I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard.",
      "As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin-stretched as it is, and we have a job to do trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. attorney's office who had resigned.",
      "We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is local law enforcement experiencing, beyond your officers, but in the U.S. attorney's office, in your local FBI?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I mean, the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city.",
      "We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so \u2013 it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away, because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-Louisiana): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself.",
      "You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours. And your fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy said: \"The events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job.",
      "They're \u2013 look, we are all \u2013 just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago.",
      "They have chaos, it seems like, all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And so I wish yesterday didn't happen.",
      "What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "When we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans, I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis \u2013 and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting \u2013 four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin.",
      "And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leaders' fault. But, at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so they have made a decision not to assist ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was talking about the federal response. He was talking to dealing with the federal issues, because, when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76 percent, homicides down 67 percent, burglary down 39 percent year to date, sex offenses down, robberies down.",
      "Motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response \u2013 the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, but, remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down.",
      "And we're seeing that across the country. ICE \u2013 look, again, any time something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret.",
      "The law says you can't be here illegally. And, if you're committing violent crimes \u2013 the president made it clear \u2013 in fact, he was elected, President Trump was elected\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 to get rid of criminals in our communities; 416,000\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because, undoubtedly, the president was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it.",
      "But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe. Almost two-thirds of Americans say they dislike the president's approach to his deportation program.",
      "There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community, yes or no, what do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out.",
      "And, in fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see, by the way, people going in the streets, breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment.",
      "When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign,\" do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a conceal-carry permit. It's worked very well there.",
      "I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know, in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime. And interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities.",
      "You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting that they were unlawful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents, throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. He wasn't talking about the victim, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: So, let's tone this down.",
      "And leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz, said they're Gestapo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to \u2013 yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. And Maine Independent Senator Angus King is standing by.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION,\" and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.",
      "Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things. Among them, giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs.",
      "What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistleblowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota. And these are stealing programs from learning center, from disabled students programs that are being stolen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And the governor did nothing about it. And obviously we're investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But voter registration logs? As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand over voter registration logs? Like, what's the purpose of that? To end ICE enforcement?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know \u2013 I know we're trying, in Congress, to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standards, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show picture I.D. Those are things we're pushing for. That's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, non-citizens cannot vote.",
      "But I want to ask you, ICE \u2013 about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said its officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, let's \u2013 let's keep in mind that the five-year-old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually protected the child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which the family and \u2013 the family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum. That's \u2013 they don't like the app he used to file for asylum. And they dispute that he fled.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, Joe Biden \u2013 Joe Biden allowed millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret. People from prisons in other countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're retroactively trying to change the legality of his status.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: President Trump was elected \u2013 the number one issue last year was President Trump saying I'm going to secure the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. And 416,000 criminals have \u2013 illegals have been arrested by ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By \u2013 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Forty-seven percent of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions, 47 percent.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By the way, ICE just put up a website \u2013 not ICE, Homeland Security, Worst of the Worst DHS. Go Google Worst of the Worst DHS. State by state they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state. You can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam, or the two-year-old who was separated from her mother.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: That father was here illegally and abandoned his child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up, 416,000 people with violent, criminal records.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: These are people \u2013 and, by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: In part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. And 416,000 of them removed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And I don't think \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They do indeed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And local law enforcement \u2013 local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. It's a felony to interfere with law enforcement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot. And that's why we are asking the questions about taxpayer funded federal \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Yes. And we don't have that chaos in other cities. Minneapolis has its own problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Failed leadership that has led to a lot of this. And it's unfortunate it happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I wish it didn't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're \u2013 we're talk \u2013 we're talking \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next \u2013 to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",
      "We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING (I-ME): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state ICE just launched this operation, Catch of the Day, which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants among others, targeting 1,400 criminal aliens who have, quote/unquote, terrorized communities in Maine.",
      "What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us.",
      "And by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established, they list 13 people in Maine. They concede that \u2013 or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are. I'm sorry, 87. My math is off.",
      "But the point is, this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the \u2013 and the \u2013 at the county jail. So, this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the president. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me I have to submit my questions in writing and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be \u2013 I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers.",
      "But this \u2013 here's the real problem, Margaret. The people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking \u2013 we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their \u2013 to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this. And it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these \u2013 by these heavy-handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of get to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully. One of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it \u2013 a job at the border.",
      "But they also point to sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like your \u2013 like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, you put your finger on it, Margaret, in the last interview. The question is not, should we enforce the law, should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals. The question is, how is it done.",
      "I did a little research this morning. Obama, during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals. But you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I have never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy-handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and we're having these incidents all over the country. So, it's not necessarily \u2013 you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last \u2013 the end of the last shutdown. But I can't vote for a bill that clues ICE funding under these circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. I \u2013 there's an easy way out, by the way. Leader Thune could separate \u2013 which is what they did in the House, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS.",
      "And, by the way, if those bills pass, 96 percent of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability. And that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's your path to avoid a shutdown.",
      "But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric. In Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement. They're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: I guess I technically would, but I \u2013 I don't \u2013 again \u2013 well, let me \u2013 let me put it in the words of the sheriff in Cumberland County, Maine, when they took one of his recruits. He called it \"bush league policing.\" And I think that sort of summarizes it. And there's no need for this overwhelming show of force.",
      "I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Again, armed people with masks and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: And intimidating protesters. That's not America.",
      "And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the \u2013 going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: These people are acting outside the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: They're ignoring our laws. And we just can't keep supporting that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right, Senator King, thank you for joining us today.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In a speech at Davos last week, Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, never mentioned President Trump by name, but he rebuked his trade wars as coercion, and he suggested the U.S. has created a rupture in the world order.",
      "We spoke with the outgoing Canadian ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, on Friday.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): I \u2013 we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time that, you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is \u2013 are important, that looking out in \u2013 for each other in important ways is a number one priority. I think in some quarters Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through. I have no doubt about that. But it \u2013 yes, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have had a long career here in the United States deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump was asked about it January 13th. He said, \"I really don't care,\" in terms of renewing it. \"There's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here.\"",
      "Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, did broad consultations, national consultations with their business communities in particular on what \u2013 how that agreement works for them and really without exception the American comments back were, sure, we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit. But job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world.",
      "So, I think there \u2013 I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people and the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up. And they are saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago your prime minister was in Beijing and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented. And it's very difficult. So, that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values and stand up to China. That seems dead if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think \u2013 I think we have to put this in perspective. The agreement that we did with China a few ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely or almost exclusively designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So, over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products, and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from their \u2013 one of their primary markets, if not for some of them their primary market.",
      "And so we went to Beijing to reestablish market access for our farmers and our fisheries. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they reestablished market access for U.S. soy farmers and in exchange roll back some tariffs and fees. So, this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He got a standing ovation for this speech.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes, he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new, brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "MARK CARNEY, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Stop invoking rules based international order as through it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is, a system of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, that's a good question. I mean I think he laid out in his discussion, his speech his view of what is happening in our world. And it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stably and maximize economic reality. So, we're moving away \u2013 or economic benefits. And we're moving away from that and we have to \u2013 countries like ours have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles, we can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by, by everyone, if they commit to them.",
      "But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic. And we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies. And part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world in trade agreements, in investment relationships, and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump posted on social media that \"Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China.\"",
      "Yet, President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built but it's supposed to be missile, layered missile defense as I understand it.",
      "Do you know what he's talking about that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't. But what I can say about the Golden Dome is this. Canada is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defense systems. And a big part of that is arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over the horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive.",
      "So, that is part \u2013 and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug into the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems where we're interoperable, we work together. We make our investments that make sense or Canada in defending our territory and defending our sovereignty. But we work with the Americans and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense but you're on board to help do that?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO because you're also a partner at NATO.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The only time that NATO's Article V was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan.",
      "Here's what President Trump said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did. They stayed a little back. A little off the front lines.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check, and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014, 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action.",
      "What does a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done. And I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true. And that's what matters.",

    "summary": "The police chief said federal immigration enforcement \"tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on Sunday that \"people have had enough\" after this weekend's fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by federal agents.",
      "Federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, on Saturday morning. The shooting came as protests have continued in Minnesota's largest city over a federal immigration enforcement surge. Earlier this month, Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, and a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg by ICE while allegedly trying to flee.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said agents were acting in self-defense while trying to disarm Pretti, while local officials have pushed back on the account.",
      "O'Hara said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that it's \"deeply concerning the things that are being said.\"",
      "\"This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city,\" O'Hara said. \"So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised.\"",
      "O'Hara added that \"the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks,\" O'Hara said.",
      "O'Hara added, \"People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again, and I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable,\" he said. \"This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Asked whether he is calling on ICE to leave Minneapolis, O'Hara said the problem isn't that \"enforcement is happening, it's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" O'Hara said.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference Saturday that Pretti was in possession of a gun and ammunition and alleged he assaulted officers. Asked whether he knows if the weapon was concealed or was brandished, O'Hara said, \"I don't have any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to help ICE officers. O'Hara called those claims \"deeply disappointing.\" He argued that local police are \"doing everything that we can to manage this chaos,\" but are vastly outnumbered by the thousands of immigration agents deployed to the city.",
      "Amid the conflicting narratives and tension between local and federal officials, O'Hara said the police department doesn't have \"any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened,\" adding that when officers responded to the scene of Saturday's shooting, \"our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting.\"",
      "\"I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us,\" O'Hara said.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and pointed to \"some failed local leadership,\" saying, \"you don't have these kinds of incidents in any other city\" with federal immigration enforcement operations.",
      "\"Look, we are all just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis, and this has happened over and over again,\" Scalise said. \"They let their city burn down years ago, they have chaos it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kevin Jiang was a 26-year-old Yale graduate student, an Army veteran, and, his friends say, a man of faith who volunteered with the homeless. He seemed to have no enemies, and no one could figure out why someone may have targeted him on Feb. 6, 2021, when he was shot in the street not far from his fianc\u00e9e's apartment in New Haven, Connecticut. Jiang had been driving down the street when his car was struck from behind, and when he got out, possibly to exchange information with the other driver police say, that driver opened fire, shooting him eight times.",
      "At first, it seemed like the murder may have been a random shooting -- possibly an act of road rage. But as detectives looked into the case, they began to unravel the truth -- unbeknownst to Jiang, someone had meticulously planned his death. Who would want to kill Kevin Jiang? And how would detectives track down the killer?",
      "The story begins with another shooting in December 2020, nearly two months before Jiang's murder.",
      "Dec. 11, 2020 \u2013 Feb. 6, 2021: A string of shootings in New Haven",
      "Beginning on Dec. 11, 2020, a seemingly random shooter fired bullets into four different homes in a couple of New Haven neighborhoods. One home was fired into in December, two in January 2021, and one in February 2021. These shootings had a few key things in common: homes were fired upon and no one was harmed, In two cases a dark-colored SUV was seen fleeing, and .45 caliber fired cartridge casings were found at all four scenes.",
      "Apart from these similarities, however, police were unable to find any other connection between the incidents. In time, it would become clear that these shootings were linked and were part of a larger plan.",
      "Jan. 30, 2021: Kevin Jiang proposes to the love of his life",
      "On Jan. 30, 2021, Jiang proposed to his girlfriend Zion Perry while on a hike to a waterfall. The two had been dating for about a year and had met at a Christian retreat. They both loved nature, attended church, and were science students: Jiang was a graduate student in the Yale School of the Environment, and Perry was also at Yale, working on a PhD in molecular biophysics and biochemistry.",
      "\"They're both brilliant and hardworking students,\" said Pastor Greg Hendrickson, who was Jiang's pastor and mentored the couple, \"and yet... they didn't feel like their accomplishments were what defined them at the deepest level.\"",
      "Perry posted a video of the engagement to her Facebook page.",
      "Feb. 6, 2021 | 8:30 p.m.: Kevin Jiang's death",
      "At 8:30 p.m. on Feb. 6, police responded to the scene of a shooting in New Haven. When they arrived, they found Jiang deceased in the street. About 100 feet away was his car, a Prius. .45 caliber casings were also found at the scene, and it appeared Jiang had been shot multiple times.",
      "Police obtained video surveillance from a nearby residence. In the video, a vehicle crash can be heard prior to Jiang's Prius entering the frame, closely followed by a dark SUV. The Prius comes to a stop, then the SUV reverses out of frame. Jiang exits his Prius and walks toward the SUV. A few seconds after he moves out of frame, eight gunshots and a scream can be heard.",
      "One witness reported that she looked at her window after hearing gunshots and saw the shooter standing over Jiang, who was already down on the pavement, firing additional shots. Detectives observed stippling -- a burn pattern caused by gunpowder exploding from a weapon fired at close range -- on Jiang's face.",
      "The evidence of close-range gunfire made detectives think there might be more to Jiang's death than a random shooting or a case of road rage. \"It seems a little bit more personal,\" said New Haven homicide detective David Zaweski. \"When you have someone laying on the ground and not moving, what would cause someone to continue firing at them?\"",
      "Just one week after Jiang's engagement, police were now informing his mother and fianc\u00e9e about his tragic death. According to detectives the two women were distraught and couldn't understand why anyone would have done this to Jiang.",
      "Feb. 6, 2021 | 8:57 p.m.: A man stuck on train tracks",
      "At 8:57 p.m. on the same night Jiang was killed, police in the nearby town of North Haven responded to a separate incident: a 911 call was made by a security guard at Sims Metal Management, a scrapyard near a highway entrance. The guard told 911 dispatch that a suspicious vehicle \u2014 a dark SUV \u2014 had driven through his yard.",
      "When officers responded to investigate the vehicle, they found the SUV \u2014 and its driver \u2014stuck on snowy railroad tracks behind the scrapyard. The officers had not yet heard about Kevin Jiang's murder, which had occurred just half an hour before in New Haven, and to them this call was nothing out of the ordinary.",
      "\"I've been on the tracks I don't know how many times with vehicles that were, you know, called in as suspicious,\" said Sergeant Jeffrey Mills of North Haven Police Department, who responded that night. \"People always come down there... and they turn around in the front lot and they leave 'cause they missed the highway or something.\"",
      "The driver was Qinxuan Pan, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student from Malden, Massachusetts. His driver's license came back clean, and officers said he seemed calm about his situation. Mills didn't notice anything odd \u2013 just a yellow jacket on the passenger seat, and some bags in the car including a black briefcase and a blue bag with a Massachusetts logo.",
      "Officers called a tow truck to help Pan get off of the tracks. Since he didn't have cash to pay for the tow, officers helped him get a hotel room for the night at a nearby Best Western, telling him he could pick up his car in the morning and head home. Pan agreed and went to the hotel. To Mills, nothing seemed suspicious about the encounter. But that would soon change.",
      "Feb. 7, 2021 | 11 a.m.: A shocking discovery",
      "The next morning at 11 a.m., another 911 call was made, this time from an employee at an Arby's restaurant in North Haven. Sergeant Jeffrey Mills was at the end of his shift and about to head home when he heard about the call, but he decided to stop by the Arby's anyway to investigate.",
      "That decision changed the course of Jiang's case. At the Arby's, employees had found something strange \u2014 discarded bags containing a .45 caliber gun. There were also numerous boxes of ammunition, three license plates, and some clothing. Some of these items looked familiar to Sgt. Mills: there was a yellow jacket, a black briefcase, and a blue bag with a Massachusetts logo. It struck Mills that these were the same items he'd seen in Pan's car the night before on the railroad tracks. The Arby's was right next door to the Best Western hotel where Pan had been dropped off.",
      "By now, Mills had heard about the homicide in New Haven, and knew detectives were looking for a dark SUV. Mills had encountered a dark SUV the night before and had reason to believe its driver was the owner of the .45 caliber gun found at the Arby's. He called New Haven Police.",
      "When homicide detectives arrived, they went to the Best Western in search of the mysterious Pan. But Pan had disappeared \u2013 in fact, according to detectives, it seemed like he had never stayed in the room at all.",
      "The SUV was still at the tow facility. Where had Pan gone? And how would they find him?",
      "Feb. 8, 2021: A stolen vehicle",
      "In Malden, the town where Pan was from, a car had been reported stolen from a car dealership. And not just any car \u2013 the same dark SUV that Pan had been driving, which was now at a tow facility in North Haven. The dealership employee told police that Pan had asked to borrow the car for a test drive and had never returned.",
      "On Feb. 8, police from Malden went to Pan's home with a warrant for his arrest for the stolen car. Officers from New Haven accompanied them, as Pan was now a person of interest in Jiang's homicide.",
      "When they arrived at the address where Pan lived with his parents, however, neither Pan nor his parents were home. The parents could have simply been out of town or on vacation, but officers also worried about them.",
      "\"Given the heinous act that occurred in New Haven the day before, were they potentially kidnapped by their own son?\"\u00a0 said Det. Joe Galvan, who worked with both New Haven Police and the U.S. Marshals' Task Force in Connecticut.",
      "That same day, the U.S. Marshals, who had joined the case, conducted a search for any phone numbers associated with Pan. They found a number and traced the phone to Garysburg, North Carolina. At a gas station there, officers found a cellphone that had been crushed.",
      "\"Like a car ran over it,\" said U.S. Marshals Supervisor Matthew Duffy.",
      "Feb. 11, 2021: Pan's parents stopped in Georgia",
      "On Feb. 11, the U.S. Marshals received several license plate reader hits on the license plate of Pan's mother's car. Georgia officials were able to locate and stop the car \u2013 inside were Pan's parents, Hong Huang and Hao Pan, but their son was not with them.",
      "Authorities say Hao Pan, Qinxuan Pan's father, told them that roughly four or five days before he'd gotten a call from his son Qinxuan Pan and Qinxuan told him he was in Connecticut and needed help, though Hao Pan didn't say why. Hao Pan did say that he and his wife Hong Huang then left Massachusetts and picked up their son in Connecticut. Qinxuan Pan then took the wheel and drove them south to Georgia, a days-long journey.",
      "As for where their son was now, authorities say Hao Pan told them that his son had stopped the car, gotten out, and walked away, and Hao Pan did not know where he went or why. Pan's mother, Hong Huang, refused to answer any questions without an attorney, but later volunteered that she believed her son may have walked away and killed himself.",
      "Investigators say they were skeptical of that story, and began to suspect that in order to find Qinxuan Pan they may have to watch his parents. The Pan family had access to millions of dollars in assets in Shanghai. Financial records showed Pan's parents had been making large cash withdrawals, possibly to give to their son. Marshals say they worried that Pan might attempt to use this money to flee the country.",
      "Feb. 16, 2021: Military honors for Kevin Jiang",
      "On Feb.16, \u00a0Jiang was buried with full military honors. He was an Army veteran and a National Guard Reservist, trained to operate a tank. He had served in the 118th Multifunctional Medical Battalion of the Connecticut National Guard.",
      "Nasya Hubbard, who served with Jiang in the National Guard, described him as a \"very happy person, just genuine, very genuine soul,\" and said that he seemed deeply in love with his fianc\u00e9e Zion Perry.",
      "At a memorial service for Jiang, Perry said, \"Kevin often spoke of how precious the gift of life is, because we are but mist that may vanish in a moment.\u00a0 Never have I felt the impact of those words until now. Kevin would want us to cherish the gift of life we still have on earth.\"",
      "Feb. 26, 2021: A warrant and a possible motive",
      "After New Haven detectives received samples back from the lab that indicated Qinxuan Pan's fingerprints were on the gun found at the Arby's and gunshot residue was on the yellow jacket and the door of the SUV, a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the murder of Kevin Jiang.",
      "By now, detectives also had in mind a possible motive for Pan. Zaweski had turned to Facebook to find information about Pan and had learned that he was Facebook friends with Zion Perry, Jiang's fianc\u00e9e",
      "Detectives say that when Perry was asked about the connection, she told officers that she and Pan met when she was an undergraduate at MIT, but they'd only been acquaintances. According to Perry they had never had a romantic relationship of any kind. Detectives found that online communication between the two was minimal \u2013 when Perry had graduated MIT, Pan had asked to video call with her to congratulate her, and she had politely declined. That was the extent of their conversation.",
      "Still, it seemed that perhaps Pan had made more of this connection than Perry. Though Pan's motive was never confirmed, the murder of Jiang occurred just one week after Perry publicly announced her engagement to Kevin on Facebook.",
      "Said\u00a0 Zaweski, \"It did seem like there was a secret obsession of Pan's going on behind the scenes that Kevin wasn't aware of, and that Zion wasn't aware of.\"",

      "The U.S. Marshals knew it would take patience to track Pan, who was a brilliant MIT graduate student studying artificial intelligence.",
      "At this point they knew that Pan was capable of disabling GPS in vehicles. They knew Pan had turned off the GPS in the SUV he had driven the night of the murder, the one he'd picked up from a dealership.",
      "It turned out that that wasn't the only time Pan had taken a car from a dealership for nefarious purposes. Investigators were able to find numerous other instances of Pan claiming he was going to test drive a dealership vehicle, only to drive that vehicle down to Connecticut. They compared the dates of his test drives with the four shootings that had occurred in New Haven from December 2020 to February 2021 and found that they matched.",
      "Detectives believe Pan had a meticulous plan. They say Pan committed those four shootings in order to mislead police into thinking that Jiang's death was just another incident in a string of random shootings.",
      "Knowing that Pan was potentially dangerous and may be looking to flee the country, U.S. Marshals were careful and methodical in their search. For weeks they steadily kept an eye on his parents' activities, believing that eventually something would lead them to their son.",
      "May 2021: Qinxuan Pan's mother makes a call",
      "In May 2021, U.S. Marshals tracked Pan's parents south to Georgia again, this time traveling with another couple. U.S. Marshal Kevin Perreault said that he believes the parents took unwitting companions along to \"make it appear that it's a regular trip. There's no big deal, we're just going on a trip, meet some friends ... we're not here to help our son.\"",
      "The two couples stayed one night at a hotel, where Pan's mother Hong Huang would be recorded on a surveillance camera making a phone call. The hotel clerk told investigators that Huang had asked to use his phone, had made a call, and then had deleted the number.",
      "But U.S. Marshals were able to track the call anyway, and it led them right to Qinxuan Pan.",

Marshals found the room where Pan was staying, and according to Duffy, Pan \"just came out and said, I'm who you're looking for.\" Qinxuan Pan was arrested for the murder of Kevin Jiang.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:55:04 -0500",
    "summary": "No one could imagine why Kevin Jiang, 26, was the target of a shooting. But for months, someone Jiang never met had a secret plan to kill him.",
    "story": [
      "On Feb. 6, 2021, Kevin Jiang, a 26-year-old Yale graduate student and former Army National Guardsman, spent the day with Zion Perry, his fianc\u00e9e, who was also a graduate student there. The couple went hiking and ice fishing, followed by dinner at her home in the affluent East Rock section of New Haven. Police say that at around 8:30 p.m. Jiang left her apartment and headed off in his Prius to his house, where he lived with his mother.",
      "He barely made it two blocks before his car was struck from behind by a dark SUV in what appeared to be a minor fender bender. Police believe he got out of his car, likely to check on how the other driver was and exchange information. Instead, the other motorist shot Jiang eight times \u2014 with several bullets fired so close to his head that the exploding gunpowder left burn marks on his face.",
      "David Zaweski, the lead homicide detective in Jiang's murder, talked with \"48 Hours\" correspondent Anne-Marie Green for \u00a0\"The Ivy League Murder.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast is streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Zaweski said that one witness told investigators she heard the minor fender bender, looked out a window, heard gunshots and saw muzzle flashes from a weapon. And another witness added that she not only heard the gunshots, but she saw the shooter \u2014 dressed all in black \u2014 standing over his fallen victim, continuing to fire bullets into him after he was down. Detectives would later recover a chilling home surveillance video that virtually captured Kevin's final moments alive, confirming the witness' accounts.",
      "But deepening the mystery was the fact that the eight spent shell casings lying near Jiang were .45 caliber bullets \u2014 and they were similar to .45 caliber shell casings found at the scene of four recent shootings in the area.",
      "According to police, a gunman had fired .45 caliber bullets into four homes over the last several months. In those cases, no one had been hurt. Investigators interviewed the homeowners but were unable to find any connection between them.",
      "At first glance, Jiang's murder had all the earmarks of a violent case of road rage. But Zaweski and his colleague Steven Cunningham quickly began to wonder if there was more.",
      "\"It seems a little bit more personal,\" Zaweski told Green. \"When you have someone laying on the ground and not moving, what would cause someone to continue firing?\"",
      "Cunningham questioned the car accident. \"Was it deliberate to get him out of the vehicle? Possibly something that was planned?\" he said.",
      "\"And if he was specifically targeted,\" Zaweski continued, \"what could have happened in his life to drive someone to do this?",
      "It was a logical investigative avenue to pursue, but after breaking the tragic news to Jiang's mother and his fianc\u00e9e, investigators say the portrait that emerged of Kevin was that of a gifted young man who couldn't have had an enemy in the world. He was living with, and taking care of, his mother, whom he brought from Seattle to live with him. He volunteered to work with the homeless, was deeply religious, and was a former lieutenant in the U.S. Army National Guard. Just a week earlier he had proposed to Perry, which she posted on Facebook, virtually on the anniversary of their meeting at a Christian retreat.",
      "Pastor Gregory Hendrickson summed up the young newly engaged couple for Green. \"They clearly shared a lot in common,\" he began. \"They both loved nature. Zion was a scientist studying molecular biophysics and biochemistry\u2026 he was in the School of the Environment. They're both brilliant and hardworking students,\" he said, \"and yet they didn't feel like their accomplishments were what defined them at the deepest level.\"",
      "Zaweski and Cunningham knew they faced a daunting investigation. Jiang's murder may just have been another random shooting by the mysterious .45 caliber gunman. Whoever the shooter was, he was still on the loose.",
      "\"The suspect was out there,\" Zaweski said. \"He wasn't identified. We didn't know where he went \u2026 and we didn't know what he would be doing next.\"",
      "With few leads to pursue and a vague image of a dark SUV from surveillance footage at the scene, they knew they likely would need a break. And they got one the following day when they received an urgent call from Sgt. Jeffrey Mills of the nearby North Haven police. He provided them with startling information about two different 911 calls.",
      "The first one occurred about a half hour after Jiang's murder. A motorist had gotten stuck on a desolate snow-covered railroad track outside a scrap metal yard he had accidentally driven into, he said, while looking for a nearby highway entrance. The motorist, Qinxuan Pan, was from Malden, Massachusetts. His record was clean, and he was calm with an excuse that Mills had heard before from others who got lost near that scrap yard. So, he helped Pan get a tow and a nearby hotel room. At the time, Mills was unaware that there had been a murder in New Haven.",
      "But about 15 hours later, at 11 a.m. on Feb. 7, Mills responded to another 911 call at an Arby's, where employees had found a bag containing a gun and box of .45 caliber bullets. The Arby's was right next door to the Best Western hotel where Pan had been taken. And by then he knew Kevin Jiang had been murdered, by someone driving a dark SUV similar to Pan's. That's when he reached out to New Haven homicide.",
      "It turned out Pan had checked into the hotel but never stayed there. And when Zaweski sent detectives to Malden, where Pan went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and lived with his parents \u2014 no one was home.",
      "Zaweski turned to his computer searching for Pan, hoping to find a connection to Jiang. \"We'll use Facebook as a tool to try and get a background on an individual, who they're friends with,\" Zaweski explained. But there seemed to be no connection with Jiang.",
      "\"And so, you're going down the list of names,\" Green says, \"Nothing, nothing, nothing, and then you're like, 'whoa.'\"",
      "\"There's our connection,\" Zaweski replies. That connection was Zion Perry, who was listed as a friend of Pan. She and Pan had met each other at a Christian group when Perry was an undergraduate at MIT. And although Perry was barely an acquaintance of Pan and hadn't communicated with him since she left MIT and moved to New Haven to attend Yale, the homicide detectives felt they had more than a break. They had a potential suspect who was missing from his home. And a possible motive: an obsession with Perry.",
      "\"It did seem like there was a secret obsession of Pan's going on behind the scenes that Kevin wasn't aware of, and that Zion wasn't aware of,\" Zaweski said. After all, Jiang's murder occurred just one week after Perry posted their engagement on Facebook, along with previous photos of them dating.",
      "Investigators believe Pan was also responsible for the four .45 caliber shootings, and that the shootings were part of a premeditated plan. They theorized that those shootings were done to mislead them when Jiang was eventually killed, to make them think his death had been just another random incident.",
      "\"He planned it, Cunningham said. \"And he knew we'd be looking at these other things.\"",
      "\"This wasn't a random incident out there,\" Zaweski added. \"He was targeted.\"",
      "Now, their homicide investigation, and the massive manhunt for their brilliant, tech-savvy MIT fugitive took off. U.S. Marshals joined the case and learned that Pan's family had access to millions of dollars in assets. Pan was missing, and they worried he might be trying to flee the country. The pressure was on.",
      "\"This became so high profile so fast,\" U.S. Marshal Joe Galvan told \"48 Hours.\" \"It was just heightened.\"",
      "The Marshals galvanized their vast resources to track down Pan. They noticed Pan's parents had withdrawn large sums of cash, and that they had taken a long trip south with their son right after the murder. When the parents had been stopped in Georgia, they were in the car, but their son was gone. They said he'd simply gotten out of the car and walked away, and they didn't know where he'd gone. Investigators were skeptical.",
      "\"They would go to the ends of the earth to help support and hide him,\" said Matthew Duffy, a supervisor of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force in Connecticut. The Marshals focused in on the parents as their way to find Pan. They knew finding him would take patience as they utilized all their surveillance techniques to track the family.",
      "Weeks went by, but eventually, their patience paid off. Pan's mother finally made a mistake that would lead the Marshals straight to her son. She made a phone call from a hotel using a clerk's phone. Investigators spoke to the clerk and were able to track that call, leading them to Pan's location at a boarding house in Alabama.",
      "\"They went there with a small army,\" Duffy said. \"Around 20 guys \u2026 he just came out and said, 'I'm who you're looking for.'\"",
      "At the time of his arrest, Pan had on him approximately $20,000 in cash, multiple communication devices, and his father's passport. He was charged with Jiang's murder, accepted a plea deal, and was sentenced in April 2024 to serve 35 years in prison.",
      "Pan's parents were never charged with anything. \"48 Hours\" reached out to the Pans, but they did not respond to our request for comment.",
      "Investigators believe that had Pan not gotten stuck on the train tracks on that fateful February night, Jiang's murder may never have been solved.",
      "\"Could he have gotten away with murder?\" Green asked Zaweski.",
      "\"He very well could have,\" Zaweski replied. \"If he had not gotten caught up on those tracks \u2026 it would've been very difficult.\"",
      "Though investigators, friends, and family were relieved that Pan had been caught and brought to justice, Jiang's mother spoke at Pan's sentencing to say she felt that 35 years was too short a sentence for the man who'd killed her only son.",
      "Perry agreed. \"I wanted to address Pan specifically,\" she said at the sentencing. \"Although your sentence is far less than you deserve \u2026 there is also mercy. May God have mercy on you. And may he have mercy on all of us.\"",
      "Even four years after Jiang's death, friends wonder what Kevin, a man of deep faith, might have thought about his killer.",
      "\"Do you think Kevin would've forgiven Pan?\" Green asked Jamila Ayeh and Nasya Hubbard, who served with Jiang in the military.",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" said Hubbard. Added Ayeh, \"Without a doubt.\"",

      "Stippling is a burn pattern caused by gunpowder exploding from a weapon fired at close range.",
      "About a hundred feet down the street \u2014",
      "Det. David Zaweski: There was a Prius just parked in the middle of the road with its hazards on.",
      "They quickly discovered the Prius belonged to Kevin. Crime scene detectives noticed a peculiar bit of damage that suggested it had been hit from behind.",
      "Det. David Zaweski: There was an impression that was left on the back bumper that looked like a license plate holder.",
      "Anne-Marie Green: So, this is like a fender bender. It's not a violent crash.",
      "Det. David Zaweski: No. There's not much damage.",
      "One witness told detectives she heard the sound of an accident and went to the window to look.",
      "Det. David Zaweski: When they look out, they see a Prius come to a stop and put its hazards on. They see a dark colored SUV pull up behind it and then reverse back toward the intersection. They see the operator of the Prius walk out and approach the SUV \u2013 most likely to see how they were, exchange insurance information. When the operator gets to the black SUV, they hear a round of gunshots and they see the muzzle flash from the gun from the driver's side of the SUV.",
      "Another witness heard the first round of gunshots and went to her window.",
      "Det. David Zaweski: When she looks outside, she sees a subject, wearing all black, standing over another individual who's laying on the ground. \u2026 she hears another round of gunshots and she can see the muzzle flash from the gun as he's firing.",

      "Det. David Zaweski: There's a little bit more to it. It seems a little bit more personal. When you have someone laying on the ground and not moving, what would cause someone to continue firing at them?",

    "summary": "For more than 30 years the murder of Debe Atrops in suburban Oregon remained unsolved. Then, an Oregon cold case team took a fresh look at the case and thought there was enough to prosecute Bob Atrops, Debe's estranged husband at the time. Their daughter thinks they have the wrong man.",
    "story": [
      "It was Thursday, Dec. 1, 1988, when Deborah Atrops, known as Debe, was found murdered in her car, next to a construction site in Beaverton, Oregon. Debe had been reported missing two days earlier by her estranged husband, Bob Atrops, who lived about five miles away on a rural road.",
      "On the night she went missing, Bob says Debe, who was then 30 years old, never arrived to pick up their baby, Rhianna, as expected.",
      "Allison Brown: It think that it's important for everyone to know that just because a case goes unsolved doesn't mean that it's forgotten.",
      "Allison Brown is a senior deputy district attorney in Washington County Oregon, who, along with attorney Chris Lewman, joined a team of investigators working on Debe's unsolved murder. Brown says they hoped talking to the original detectives, witnesses, and looking at the evidence again, might give the old investigation new momentum.",
      "Allison Brown: There were opportunities for forensic analysis that were not available in 1988.",
      "DEBE ATROPS DISAPPEARS",
      "Debe Atrops was last seen alive on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 1988. Bob Atrops called the Tigard, Oregon, police that night at 9:40 p.m.",
      "DISPATCHER: This is Tigard Police. May I help you?",
      "BOB ATROPS: \u2026 My wife is running about three hours overdue from a hair appointment. I was getting a little concerned. \u2026 We live in Sherwood. \u2026",
      "DISPATCHER: OK, what's her name? \u2026",
      "BOB ATROPS: Deborah Atrops.",
      "DISPATCHER: OK, and what kind of vehicle would she have been driving?",
      "BOB ATROPS: It'd be a black Honda Accord.",
      "Bob told the dispatcher Debe hadn't shown up after an appointment in Tigard, about eight miles from his house, at a hair salon called Razz Ma Tazz.",
      "BOB ATROPS: Called and let it ring, ring, ring about 20 times \u2026",
      "DISPATCHER: It would probably be easier for you to make a run down her path to, you know, how she would go \u2026 than it would be for us.",
      "Bob says he drove the route and saw no sign of Debe. He called Tigard police back at 10:25 p.m.",
      "DISPATCHER: Why don't we give it another hour \u2026 and, if you haven't heard anything, give me a call back.",
      "Bob did call back \u2014 a third time \u2014 at 11:29 p.m.",
      "BOB ATROPS: Hey, this is Bob Atrops again. Have you heard anything or\u2014?",
      "DISPATCHER: No, and the guys have gone out and looked. It's real foggy out, but they have checked around the area.",
      "DISPATCHER: \u00a0\u2026 Did you go to the Razz Ma Tazz and see if her car was there at all?",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yeah, I did. I drove up there's no car \u2026",
      "DISPATCHER: There's no friends or anything she might have gone to visit?",
      "BOB ATROPS: No. Checked. Called everyone I can think of.",
      "But the one call Bob did not make that night was to Debe.",
      "DISPATCHER: OK sir, we have checked around the Sherwood area and we can't find her car at all.",
      "The dispatcher suggested Bob call the Washington County Sheriff, which he did at 11:34 p.m., and they opened a missing person's case the next morning. But Debe Atrops would not be a missing person for long.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: Even though I've been retired for years, it still kind of hung over me.",
      "Washington County Sheriff's Detective Michael O'Connell remembers responding to the scene when Debe's car was found. The license plates had been taken off, the window was open and the keys were inside. O'Connell's partner called Bob Atrops.",
      "DETECTIVE LAZENBY: With you being the husband --",
      "BOB ATROPS: Uh-huh.",
      "DETECTIVE LAZENBY: --- we need permission. We'd like to search the car \u2026",
      "BOB ATROPS: OK.",
      "DETECTIVE LAZENBY: And I'd like to know if that'd be alright with you.",
      "BOB ATROPS: Sure.",
      "A few minutes later police found Debe's body face down in the trunk.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: She was nicely dressed. \u2026 Still had her coat on \u2026 Looked like she'd been placed somewhat carefully in the trunk.",
      "Police say Debe had been strangled, and there were no signs of sexual assault. There was mud on her coat and shoes, the front passenger tire and the steering wheel of the car. Law enforcement scoured her vehicle for evidence.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: It looked like someone may have tried to wipe down the hood. There were, like, broad clothing swipes, like, someone maybe was trying to destroy fingerprints.",
      "O'Connell and his partner went to Bob's house to tell him they had found his wife's body. A witness who saw Bob later that day told the cold case team Bob was \"very calm, much calmer than I would expect.\"",
      "Allison Brown | Prosecutor: It wasn't consistent with a grieving, estranged husband.",
      "Debe's stepfather, Ed Holland, says her mother, Gloria, who was close to Debe, was overwhelmed with grief.",
      "Ed Holland: She broke down \u2026 and I held her, and that's all I could do \u2026 She just laid there, sobbing.",
      "Police searched outside Bob's home for any further clues.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: The driveway was a mix of mud, dirt, and gravel. And it looked like \u2026 her car may have driven through some of the mud.",
      "Bob had said Debe was last there about a week before her murder. Police took photos of the tire tracks outside his house and collected soil from his driveway and lawn.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: Just to make sure we weren't missing anything.",
      "Police never found any tire tracks that matched Debe's car on Bob's property. Yet Bob Atrops was an obvious suspect. But he wasn't the only man in Debe's life. Since she had moved out five months before, Debe had been dating\u2014and those relationships were complicated.",
      "Ed Holland: Debe had very good taste and was a good judge of people, but a terrible judge of men. Every man that she seemed to hook up with was a problem.",
      "WHO KILLED DEBE ATROPS?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: It was great growing up with my dad. He was an amazing dad.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you have memories of him being hands on? \u2026",
      "Rhianna Stephens: Yeah. My dad was very hands on \u2026 I knew that I was his number one.",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I remember being at my grandpa's house with my cousin, going through old photo albums and finding a picture of this woman. And I was like, \"Who's that?\" And she just kind of was like, \"That's your mom.\" \u2026 From that point on, I always remember knowing the story.",
      "Debe Atrops' daughter Rhianna Stephens says she learned about her mother's murder when she was 6 or 7 years old. She says growing up, her dad only shared fond memories of her mom.",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I didn't know that they had separated. \u2026 Anything that I had ever heard about her was always good from him.",
      "But things were not always good in Bob and Debe's marriage. Debe's stepfather, Ed Holland, remembers meeting Bob, a construction product salesman, and talking to Debe's mother about how quickly Bob and Debe walked down the aisle.",
      "Ed Holland: They were still in a courtship when they got married. \u2026 I said to Gloria, I said, \"This is way too fast.\" \u2026 She says, \"Well, if they're in love, why not?\"",
      "Debe's friend Darlene Lufkin says, like Holland, she was not confident the relationship had a strong foundation.",
      "Natalie Morales: How long did they know each other?",
      "Darlene Lufkin: Just a few months it seems like. \u2026 It takes time to get to know someone. And I don't think she really knew Bob yet.",
      "Bob and Debe got married in June 1987 and adopted Rhianna the following March.",
      "Because of conflicts in their marriage, just a few months after bringing Rhianna home, Debe moved into her own apartment in Salem, 30 miles away from Bob. Investigators say Debe had soon reconnected with an old boyfriend, Jeff Freeburg.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said he was the one for her, perhaps \u2026",
      "Darlene Lufkin: That's the one she kept wanting to go back to. \u2026 She really, really liked him. And I don't think he was just ready for that kind of relationship yet.",
      "By September 1988, Debe had a new boyfriend\u2014a man she met at work\u2014named John Pearson. Pearson was separated from his wife and had two young boys.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: But I remember she was on the phone at my house once with him. She handed me the phone, and he said how much he was looking forward to meeting me and the girls. \u2026",
      "Darlene Lufkin: When Debe was seeing people for some reason, she wanted them to meet me and my girls.",
      "Lufkin says she and Debe had grown close in their 20s when Darlene was a single mom.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: She's really the only friend I had that enjoyed spending time with my daughters. And I treasured that.",
      "In that autumn of 1988, although Debe was dating Pearson, she stayed in touch with Freeburg. He loaned Debe $8,000.",
      "Natalie Morales: He had lent her money to buy\u2026\u00a0 a car. Could there have been motive in that?",
      "Allison Brown: He was wealthy \u2026\u00a0 So, I think he was happy to help Debe.",
      "Back in 1988, detectives had asked Freeburg for his alibi on the night Debe was last seen alive\u2014 and he said he was home except for going out briefly to get some dinner.",
      "Det. O'Connell: He seemed very straightforward. Didn't hesitate to answer our questions. Didn't seem to be hiding anything.",
      "Police had also questioned John Pearson, who said he was with his children and his estranged wife that night. Pearson knew about Debe's hair appointment and gave detectives a detailed description of many items inside her car.",
      "Natalie Morales: John Pearson \u2026 told police back then that there was a Burger King bag \u2026 as well as a box with cranberries and a child car seat. \u2026 Seems like a lot of details about \u2026 the car.",
      "Allison Brown: Yeah.",
      "Pearson also told police there \"wasn't enough room in the trunk for a body\" and that \"stuff would have to have been taken out\" ... but O'Connell says Pearson had seemed truthful back in 1988.",
      "Det. O'Connell: He was mostly accessible. \u2026 Didn't appear to be trying to throw us off or anything.",
      "And prosecutors Chris Lewman and Allison Brown say there is an innocent reason John Pearson knew so much about Debe's car.",
      "Allison Brown: They were seeing each other every day. \u2026 I mean, something to look into for sure, which is why they did multiple interviews of John Pearson and a polygraph in 1988. \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales: And did he pass the polygraph?",
      "Allison Brown: He did. And he was willing to do it and basically do everything that they asked him to do.",
      "Bob Atrops hired a lawyer a week after Debe's body was found and declined to take a polygraph. Detective O'Connell says, Bob did not seem very worried about finding out who killed his wife.",
      "Det. O'Connell: He was kind of removed. \u2026 just kind of distant.",
      "O'Connell and his partner looked into the calls Bob said he made the night Debe went missing.",
      "Bob told detectives he called the babysitter, Debe's boss, and her parents while he was home waiting for her. They all confirmed he did call them that night \u2013 but there was a hitch. Those three calls were long distance and should have shown up on his phone bill.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: That was a problem. Those phone calls were not there.",
      "By now detectives suspected Bob had killed Debe. They thought there was no record of those three phone calls because Bob was out of the house that evening disposing of Debe's car and her body. Police began looking for evidence Bob made those calls from somewhere else.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: It involved checking payphones. \u2026 We looked at every angle. \u2026 We struck out.",
      "They did not find proof that Bob was lying or evidence connecting him to Debe's murder.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: I didn't like the thought of it just remaining unsolved.",
      "O'Connell and his partner had a final meeting with Bob in 1990\u2014asking him to account for those missing calls, or to admit he had killed his wife. But Bob maintained his innocence.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: And then it kind of went dead.",
      "When the cold case team next interviewed Bob in 2022, they asked again about those phone calls and heard a very different story.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: I'll be honest with you, Bob. Your story that you're telling us today is significantly different than what you told investigators back in the day ... And so, my question is ... what really did happen?",
      "A NEW LOOK AT THE COLD CASE",
      "Darlene Lufkin: We spent a lot of time \u2026 together. \u2026 We took the girls to the beach ... went to ... music in the park with picnic dinners.",
      "It's been more than 30 years since Darlene Lufkin last saw her friend Debe Atrops, but she says she still feels the loss.",
      "Natalie Morales: Sounds like you have really fond memories of Debe.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: Oh yeah. \u2026 I miss her every day still.",
      "Lufkin, like many in Debe's life, longed for answers and in 2022 she got one step closer when the cold case team sent Debe's coat and those soil samples for testing.",
      "Allison Brown: The soil was sent to the FBI lab. The DNA was sent.",
      "While they waited, the cold case team continued to examine Bob's behavior back in 1988, which prosecutors say was suspicious from that first call.",
      "Allison Brown: He calls law enforcement within, you know, probably 20 minutes of calling their friends and family and to us that seemed, a little quick \u2026 So, we believe he was attempting to \u2026 get his story out there and to portray himself as a concerned husband and try to \u2026 develop that narrative that he wanted to early on.",
      "Detective O'Connell says he had the same feeling. Remember, Bob had called police four times that night.",
      "Det. Michael O'Connell: What's the Shakespeare quote? He protests too much? It was interesting to us that he was calling so frequently and so soon. \u2026 It didn't seem normal.",
      "The cold case team also turned their attention to the road where Debe's car was found \u2014 next to that construction site. Bob's former boss at Allied Building Products told them he believed Bob had a connection there.",
      "Allison Brown: He was \u2026 selling roofing products \u2026 we knew, I knew that he was selling products in that area.",
      "In 2022, the results from those DNA tests came back. The lab said they found a mixture of DNA on the collar and shoulder of Debe's coat.",
      "Allison Brown: They swabbed that area of her coat, because if you're strangled, that would be the area \u2026 you'd have contact with.",
      "The lab compared that sample from Debe's coat to her boyfriend at the time, John Pearson.",
      "Allison Brown: It's not present.",
      "And neither was her ex-boyfriend, Jeff Freeburg.",
      "Allison Brown: Jeff Freeburg \u2026 not present.",
      "But the lab said Bob could not be excluded as a contributor to that DNA mixture.",
      "Chris Lewman: We can't say it's a match. It's just, it's moderate support that it's more likely Mr. Atrops than an unknown individual.",
      "Prosecutors admit, while the DNA from Debe's coat excludes Freeburg and Pearson, it does not make a complete case against Bob Atrops.",
      "Allison Brown: I think it's another piece. \u2026 There are many, many different pieces. It was a very fact intensive case.",
      "Another one of those pieces, they say, is the mud.",
      "Allison Brown: This murder was connected to mud. Her body was covered in mud, there was mud on the outside of the car, on the inside of the car.",
      "The FBI lab, which examined this evidence, concluded that the mud on Debe's car tire did not match the mud where her car was found. However, that mud on the tire, they said, was \"indistinguishable\" from the mud from Bob's lawn in color, composition and texture. This is evidence, prosecutors say, that Bob was lying when he said Debe did not come to his house the night she went missing.",
      "Allison Brown: According to the defendant's interview, she had not been to his house for about 10 days.",
      "Bob Atrops hadn't spoken to police about the case since that final conversation with detectives in 1990. But in 2022, he agreed to talk to the cold case team.",
      "Investigators asked Bob about those calls to friends and family that didn't appear on his phone bill back in 1988.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: It is October 19th, 2022 ...\u00a0 here with \u2026 Bob Atrops.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: You made those phone calls?",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yes.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: From your house?",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yes.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: Using your home phone?",
      "BOB ATROPS: With an MCI card.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: No.",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yes.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: No.",
      "Bob now said he had used an MCI calling card to make those missing long distance calls from home.",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yeah, an MCI card from Allied Building Products \u2026",
      "DET. WINFIELD: That is not what you told investigators. ...\u00a0 and you said, \"I made those calls from my home phone.\"",
      "BOB ATROPS: Yes.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: \"Using my home long distance.\"",
      "BOB ATROPS: But you dial in, and \u2026 you punch in the code and then you can complete the long-distance call.",
      "Prosecutors say Bob didn't have that MCI calling card in 1988, and what's more, prosecutor Chris Lewman says, this story doesn't make sense.",
      "Chris Lewman: In 1988, to make a calling card, you had to input about a 16-digit calling card number and then another six- or eight-digit code. And if you're frantically looking for your wife, why take the time to do that, and enter all those numbers?",
      "In 2023, prosecutors brought the case to a grand jury\u2014who voted to indict.",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I got a phone call on March 2nd of 2023 at five o'clock in the morning \u2026 that my dad had just been arrested. \u2026 I was just in shock.",
      "Rhianna says Bob is a loving dad, and a doting grandfather to her three children.",
      "Natalie Morales: What was it like seeing your dad \u2026 \u00a0front page story?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: It was awful to see the news \u2026 making him out to be this terrible person that he just isn't. \u2026",
      "Rhianna Stephens: He didn't do this.",
      "Cold case detectives spoke to Bob Atrops again after his arrest.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: My opinion is, you've told yourself a story for the last 34 years, and you've told yourself the story over and over and over again to the point that it's become the truth for you ...\u00a0 It doesn't make it true, but it makes it easier for you to tell that story.",
      "BOB ATROPS: I don't believe that, but OK.",
      "DET. WINFIELD: What part don't you believe?",
      "BOB ATROPS: A story that I created, I guess. \u2026",
      "DET. WINFIELD: You don't believe that you created a story?",
      "BOB ATROPS: No.",
      "DETECTIVE WINFIELD: OK. \u2026",
      "DETECTIVE WINFIELD: You just are not in a position to acknowledge that you played a role in her death.",
      "BOB ATROPS: No, I did not.",
      "Bob Atrops pleaded not guilty to Debe's murder. Attorney April Yates argues it's more likely Debe's killer was her boyfriend at the time, John Pearson, than Bob.",
      "April Yates: John Pearson not only had motive, he had opportunity. He knew where Debe Atrops was going to be. He knew about her hair appointment. And also, he knew an incredible amount of detail about her car.",
      "But prosecutors say Pearson had nothing to do with Debe's murder. Back in 1988 he told police that, about a week before the murder, Bob confronted Debe because he was suspicious she was in a new relationship. Pearson said Debe was afraid if Bob found out it was true, he would kill her. The prosecution planned to call Pearson as a witness in Bob Atrops' upcoming trial.",
      "Chris Lewman: We wanted to have him testify \u2026 because we found him credible.",
      "But that would never happen. Pearson, who had been ill, and had an outstanding warrant for a DUI in Oregon, stopped responding to detectives. When authorities located him in Arizona, five days before opening arguments were to begin, John Pearson killed himself.",
      "Janis Puracal: John Pearson fled the state ... He was on the run.",
      "Attorney Janis Puracal was part of the defense team.",
      "Janis Puracal: Police find him in a trailer in the desert in Arizona. When police surround that trailer, he \u2026 ends his life, rather than coming back to Oregon to answer questions about Debe Atrops murder. Those are the facts. Prosecution can spin it all they want, but those are the facts.",
      "DID BOB ATROPS MURDER HIS ESTRANGED WIFE?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I'm trying to be strong for my dad.",
      "In spring 2025, Robert Atrops' murder trial began at the Washington County Courthouse. Prosecutors worried the jury might get stuck on details they could not explain.",
      "Allison Brown: In a case where we need to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, we're not going to be able to answer every single detail of what happened that night.",
      "ALLISON BROWN (in court): Remember, the appointment's supposed to end around 7:15 ... By 9:40 p.m., he's calling 911.",
      "At the trial, which allowed audio but not video recording of witnesses, attorney Allison Brown argues that Bob Atrops intentionally misled the police \u2014 starting with those four calls he made to them the night Debe was last seen alive.",
      "Allison Brown: He didn't tell the law enforcement officials that they were separated, that they lived separately \u2026 So, he didn't actually give them the information that they would need to find her.",
      "Bob didn't tell police Debe lived in Salem until the next day. Even more incriminating, prosecutors say, is the fact that Bob Atrops did not call Debe the night she went missing -- or ever.",
      "Chris Lewman: He never called her apartment.",
      "Allison Brown: \u2026 that would've been the first phone call, right? \u2026 Someone hasn't showed up. You're expecting them. You call them.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm.",
      "Allison Brown: \u2026 not only was that not the first phone call, but he never made that phone call at all.",
      "At trial, prosecutors played Bob's interview with investigators in 2022 where he explained why he didn't ever make that call.",
      "DET. CAREY: Did you ever call Debe's place?",
      "BOB ATROPS: Her house? No ... I didn't even consider that as an option ...",
      "DET. CAREY: So, let me rephrase and correct me if I'm right, you never considered calling the place she lives?",
      "BOB ATROPS: Not when she was supposed to be in our vicinity, no.",
      "Prosecutors also want the jury to hear more about the troubles in Bob and Debe's marriage. Debe's friend Christy Knapp testified to an encounter with Bob at his house, soon after Debe moved out.",
      "CHRISTY KNAPP (court audio): We went there to get some serving dishes. ... We walked into the entry, and he just started freaking out and screaming. ... He seemed really, really tall, and really scary. ... It was terrifying.",
      "Another friend, Tami Nelsen, told police in 1988 Debe had confided in her that Bob Atrops had choked her in a violent confrontation shortly before she moved out. Nelsen told the jury Debe was still worried about Bob after their separation.",
      "ALLISON BROWN (court audio): What did she say she was concerned about?",
      "TAMI NELSEN: Well, she was concerned that he'd kill her. ... And I thought she was teasing to begin with \u2026 you know, or she was being dramatic.",
      "ALLISON BROWN: Yeah.",
      "TAMI NELSEN: And so, I turned around and I looked at her, and I saw that she was genuinely scared.",
      "Nelsen had also told police in 1988 that a few months before her murder, Debe was worried about Bob finding out about her relationship with John Pearson. Nelsen later told the cold case team Debe had said, \"If anything happens to me Bob did it.\"",
      "Allison Brown: Debe is predicting her own murder. She is telling friends and family if he finds out about this, he will kill me.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm.",
      "Allison Brown: And she was right.",
      "But in their cross-examinations, the defense suggests these stories Debe told are not reliable and they say Debe had a history of making up false tales.",
      "April Yates: She had told different stories to different people, and these things were verifiably not true.",
      "Some of Debe's friends say she did tell questionable stories, often about her health. Darlene says she thought Debe might have done it for attention.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: One time she said that she went to work out \u2026 her stomach flipped or something and she had to go get emergency help with it \u2026 It didn't seem real to me.",
      "Attorney April Yates says there is a simple explanation for why Bob Atrops didn't call Debe that night\u2014he had spoken to her stepfather, Ed Holland.",
      "April Yates: Ed told Bob that he had been by Debe's apartment \u2026 and she wasn't home. \u2026 There was no reason for Bob to call.",
      "April Yates: And the next morning, Debe's parents went to her apartment again, as did law enforcement, so there was no reason for Bob to call or go there. The fact that the state is trying to make something out of that \u2014 it's a red herring.",
      "During trial, the babysitter and Debe's stepfather testified that Bob had called them the night Debe went missing, which supports Bob's story. Attorney Stephanie Pollan says the best explanation for why those so-called missing calls weren't on his phone bill is that the billing equipment was faulty.",
      "Stephanie Pollan: We found the engineer \u2026 and he testified that this equipment failed all the time.",
      "But the cold case team believes Bob made those calls while he was out of the house, getting rid of evidence, to help him create a false alibi. And they say it was impossible to check every payphone in the area back in 1988.",
      "Allison Brown: What was significant is he's not where he said he was, he's not at home. Why would he lie about where he was that night?",
      "While the state emphasized the link between the mud on Debe's tire and the soil from Bob Atrops' front yard, the defense says that this soil is everywhere in the region and is as common as \u2014 dirt.",
      "April Yates: This soil is everywhere. \u2026 My yard, her yard, the DA's yard. It doesn't make us suspects in a murder.",
      "Back in 1988 police didn't collect mud from Jeff Freeburg's property, or John Pearson's. They only took samples from where Debe's car was found and from Bob Atrops' driveway and lawn. Then there was the matter of the DNA from Debe's coat.",
      "April Yates: \u2026 the DNA in this case doesn't tell the jury anything about who killed Debe Atrops.",
      "Attorney Yates points out that the amount of DNA on Debe's coat that the lab had said could be consistent with Bob Atrops was miniscule\u2014the equivalent of about six skin cells.",
      "April Yates: And this very low level of DNA is consistent with something called transfer DNA \u2026 People who have babies and shared custody transfer DNA all the time.",
      "Natalie Morales: So, in your opinion, this DNA was not strong evidence?",
      "April Yates: This DNA was not only not strong evidence\u2014it doesn't mean anything.",
      "The defense argues there is a much more important DNA result from Debe's autopsy.",
      "Janis Puracal: One of the very first items that the lab tested for DNA were vaginal swabs taken from the autopsy.",
      "Attorney Janis Puracal specializes in evidence that can lead to wrongful convictions. She says the DNA from Debe's autopsy does not point to Bob Atrops.",
      "Janis Puracal: The semen came from John Pearson. \u2026 and the likelihood ratio \u2026 is 94.6 sextillion. \u2026 it's an enormous number.",
      "And she points out Pearson's DNA at autopsy contradicts his statement to police from 2022.",
      "Janis Puracal: John Pearson told law enforcement that he did not have sexual contact with Debe Atrops in the 72 hours before she was murdered, and definitely not on the day that she was murdered. But they found that semen \u2026 two days later, at the autopsy. Everything is telling us that that \u2026 was most likely deposited on the day that she was murdered.",
      "And the defense reminds the jury, John Pearson was avoiding the cold case team in the months leading up to his suicide. In its closing statement, the defense says the state just doesn't have enough to make its case against Bob Atrops.",
      "But prosecutors argue all of the pieces point in one direction -- to Bob Atrops.",
      "Allison Brown: Like you hear: motive, means and opportunity, he had it all.",
      "Now, after two weeks of testimony, it is time for the jury to decide.",
      "Allison Brown: We didn't know if that would be enough or not. \u2026 it's incredibly nerve-wracking.",
      "\"WE ARE GRIEVING SOMEONE THAT IS STILL ALIVE\"",
      "Natalie Morales: What did you think before the jury left to go deliberate? Did you feel confident?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I didn't feel confident. I just\u2014 because of the fear of the unknown. \u2026 I don't feel like any evidence was actually given that proves my dad did this. \u2026 because he didn't. There is no evidence that he did this.",
      "On April 17, 2025, the jury reached a decision.",
      "Stephanie Pollan: It was six hours that they were deliberating. \u2026 we thought that that was a quick verdict and that could be a good thing.",
      "JUDGE OSCAR GARCIA (court audio): My understanding, the jury has a verdict in this case. Is that correct?",
      "FOREPERSON: Correct. \u2026",
      "JUDGE OSCAR GARCIA: To the charge of murder in the second degree, the jury has found the defendant guilty.",
      "Guilty. Thirty-seven years after her death, Robert Atrops was found guilty of murdering Debe Atrops.",
      "April Yates: It was like the room went dead silent \u2026 and everything was still in that moment.",
      "Rhianna Stephens: We all crumbled. We are grieving someone that is still alive. \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales: Were you able to say anything to your father in that moment right after?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: No. I \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales: Hug him, nothing?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I haven't been able to hug my dad in over two years.",
      "April Yates: We had so many family and friends of Bob behind us. \u2026 It was really hard, for them especially, to see this happen to their loved one.",
      "Natalie Morales: I could see it's hard for you, too.",
      "April Yates: It is hard. It's hard to have an innocent client get convicted.",
      "Prosecutors say they are glad that justice was served.",
      "Natalie Morales: This case took 37 years to finally be resolved. Are you satisfied that we know the truth about what happened to Debe Atrops?",
      "Allison Brown: Yeah, absolutely \u2026 There's no other people \u2026 no other suspects, no one else with the motive. \u2026 We feel absolutely a hundred percent sure that he's the one who committed this crime.",
      "Prosecutors are confident the investigation proved the other men in Debe's life, including Jeff Freeburg, were not involved in her murder. Freeburg declined \"48 Hours\"' request to comment on the case.",
      "Allison Brown: There just really wasn't any information that pointed in the direction of Jeff Freeburg \u2026 he gave his DNA freely \u2026 There really just wasn't any motive, evidence, or anything else that caused him to be a significant suspect.",
      "And, they say, John Pearson's suicide was an unrelated tragedy.",
      "Chris Lewman: He had an open criminal case \u2026I believe he thought they were there to arrest him for this misdemeanor warrant and took his life.",
      "Allison Brown: There was quite a bit of investigation that was done by our detective after he committed suicide to show it had nothing to do with guilt for Debe's murder.",
      "When \"48 Hours\" reached out in 2025, Pearson's lawyer declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors say Pearson's family told them he had wanted to testify at Bob's trial.",
      "Chris Lewman: I thought that it would be important for him to \u2026 relay all the things he knew, including those statements that Debe made back in 1988, that \u2026 Bob's going to kill me if he finds out about us.",
      "As for the defense's argument that Debe had a history of making up stories, prosecutors say this is unfortunately consistent with life inside an abusive relationship.",
      "Allison Brown: When someone's going through a domestic violence situation, they are in a way living a lie.",
      "Natalie Morales: Bob's side of the courtroom \u2026 was full. \u2026 Did that strike you as interesting?",
      "Allison Brown: It depends on the case.",
      "Chris Lewman: Yeah, I mean, I think he had a large support system and it's not uncommon for people \u2026 in a domestic abuse situation to kind of go unknown as a DV abuser \u2026 And I think Bob was good at that. I mean, he was a salesman.",
      "After all these years, Darlene Lufkin says she thinks the jury got it right.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: I had my suspicions all along \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales: You believed that that was the right verdict?",
      "Darlene Lufkin: I do. \u2026 I just feel that the question's been answered now.",
      "At her father's sentencing in July 2025, Rhianna Stephens made an emotional appeal for leniency.",
      "RHIANNA STEPHENS (in court): When I was 8 months old, someone robbed me of getting to have a life with my mom, there to support my every milestone. ... Thirty-six years later, I'm being robbed of my father, the man that was there for all of those milestones. ... I need him in my life.",
      "Attorney Pollan read a letter from Bob Atrops' current wife who has been married to him since 2011.",
      "STEPHANIE POLLAN (reading letter in court): \"My husband has always been a devoted and loving father to his daughter.\"",
      "Despite these appeals, the judge sentenced Robert Atrops to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years.",
      "Natalie Morales: When you lost your mom at a young age, and you said, now you grieve your dad who's still alive, how do you make sense of what's happening?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I can't make sense of what's happening. I just have to live through it and keep fighting.",
      "Darlene Lufkin: She truly loved Rhianna \u2026",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you want people to know about your friend, Debe?",
      "Darlene Lufkin: That she didn't deserve this \u2026 that she was a light that should still be here.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think about your mother now?",
      "Rhianna Stephens: I do think about her. I wonder what life would've been like. \u2026 had I gotten to live \u2026 my whole life, grow up having my mom.",

Ice was also covering roads and bridges in parts of Mississippi, according to Scott Simmons, a spokesman for Mississippi's emergency management agency.",
      "Freezing rain was already coating roads Saturday in Texas and Alabama, and cars in Mississippi. Nearly 200 Florida utilities workers were in Georgia and South Carolina, in position for what is to come.",

In at least 11 Southern states, the majority of homes are heated by electricity, raising the possibility of dangerously cold conditions during an outage.",
      "\"Once we get more than about a quarter inch of ice on those lines, the lines either start sagging and failing, or more likely, you actually get the vegetation above it, the trees, to fall on the lines, and that causes potentially a larger number of outages,\" said Thomas Overbye, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University.",

    "story": [
      "Family members say the man killed by a federal officer in Minneapolis on Saturday, 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, was an intensive care nurse at the Veterans Administration who cared deeply about people and was upset by President Trump's immigration crackdown in his city.",
      "They told The Associated Press he was an avid outdoorsman who loved getting in adventures with Joule, his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog who also recently died. He had participated in protests following the killing of\u00a0Renee Good, who was shot\u00a0behind the wheel of her SUV by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Law Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "\"He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,\" said Michael Pretti, Alex's father. \"He felt that doing the protesting was a way to express that, you know, his care for others.\"",
      "Pretti was a U.S. citizen, born in Illinois. Like Good, court records showed he had no criminal record and his family said he had never had any interactions with law enforcement beyond a couple of traffic tickets.",
      "In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who live in Wisconsin, told him to be careful when protesting.",
      "\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" Michael Pretti said. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"",
      "A neighbor described Pretti as someone who \"would always be willing to help others.\"",
      "\"I didn't know Alex super well, but he was a great guy and neighbor,\" she told CBS Minnesota station WCCO. \"He loved his car and took very good care of it. He used to have a dog who passed around a year or two ago, I think. I remember how sweet it was that, as his dog was more elderly, less mobile, he'd be willing to carry him down to the yard to get some fresh air and to enjoy the outdoors. His dog would lay down and Alex would sit with him and pet him for long periods of time. He was very caring, you could tell. We are all heartbroken and are praying for his family and friends and for justice for him.\"",
      "Alex Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir.",
      "After graduation, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to the family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.",
      "Family \"heartbroken but also very angry\"",
      "Family members said Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota. They said they had never known him to carry it.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said\u00a0the shooting happened\u00a0after he \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Officials did not specify if Pretti brandished the gun, and it is not visible in bystander videos of the shooting obtained and verified by CBS News, The AP and other outlets.",
      "\"We are heartbroken but also very angry,\" his parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, said in a statement.",
      "\"Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,\" they said. \"Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman,\" referring to his effort to aid another protester who was pushed by an officer.",
      "They accused the Trump administration of telling \"sickening lies\" and said \"Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.\"",
      "\"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they said.",
      "The shooting came one day after\u00a0tens of thousands of people marched\u00a0through downtown Minneapolis to protest ICE's presence in the city.",
      "The family first learned of the shooting when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. They watched the video and said the man killed appeared to be their son. They then tried reaching out to officials in Minnesota.",
      "\"I can't get any information from anybody,\" Michael Pretti said Saturday. \"The police, they said call Border Patrol, Border Patrol's closed, the hospitals won't answer any questions?\"",
      "Eventually, the family called the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, who they said confirmed there was a body matching the name and description of their son.",
      "As of Saturday evening, the family said they had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son's death.",
      "Pretti's ex-wife, who spoke to the AP but later said she didn't want her name used, said she was not surprised he would have been involved in protesting Trump's immigration crackdown. She said she had not spoken to him since they divorced more than two years ago and she moved to another state.",
      "She said he was a Democratic voter and that he had participated in the wave of street protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, not far from the couple's neighborhood. She described him a someone who might shout at law enforcement officers at a protest, but she had never known him to be physically confrontational.",
      "She said Pretti got a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated.",
      "Pretti had \"a great heart\" and \"loved this country\"",
      "Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building about 2 miles from where he was shot. Neighbors described him as quiet and warmhearted.",
      "\"He's a wonderful person,\" said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Pretti and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"",
      "If there was something suspicious going on in the neighborhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help.",
      "Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbors said, and would sometimes have friends over.",
      "His neighbors knew he had guns \u2014 he'd occasionally take a rifle to shoot at a gun range \u2014 but were surprised at the idea that he might carry a pistol on the streets.",
      "\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",
      "His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before his death. They talked about repairs he had done to the garage door of his home. The worker was a Latino man, and they said with all that was happening in Minneapolis, he gave the man a $100 tip.",
      "Pretti's mother said her son cared immensely about the direction the county was headed, especially the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.",
      "\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti said. \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"",

Homeland Security alleged he \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a handgun, but\u00a0multiple videos taken before the shooting show Pretti \u2014 a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry \u2014 without a weapon in hand before agents tackled him to the ground.",
      "Cowmeadow told CBS Minnesota that residents want federal agents out of their state, saying the situation is \"total chaos.\"",
      "\"I just think that we need to stand together,\" Cowmeadow said. \"We need to tell the truth about what we see, and not let others tell us about what we see.\"",

      "\"We're trying to be a public house. We're trying to let the neighbors gather in peace and in safety in and defy against this bulls***,\" Cowmeadow said. \"There's a lot of ripples, not just emotionally, spiritually in people's lives, but economically in the neighborhoods and businesses.\"",
      "Tomme Beevas' restaurant is located on Nicollet Avenue, also just a short walk away from the shooting. The owner of Pimento Jamaican Kitchen brought stanchions from his rum bar to the street to keep protesters separated from officers, working as a volunteer to ensure the demonstration remains peaceful.",
      "\"This has been a safe space for our community and the violence right here on our doorsteps is alarming,\" Beevas, who was wearing a bright neon vest, told CBS Minnesota. \"We have immigrants.

      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) considers child care affordable when households spend no more than 7% of their total annual income on such services. By that measure, households need an income of nearly $403,000 to cover the cost of care for two children, LendingTree, an online loan marketplace, estimates.",

      "\"Child care costs are just incredibly daunting for all but the wealthiest Americans,\" Matt Schulz, a chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, told CBS News. \"It forces parents into some really tough choices, including whether to have kids or not.\"",
      "Schulz said the report makes clear that limiting child care costs to 7% of your income \"just isn't realistic anymore.\" Federal labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows that families spend between 8.9% and 16% of their median income on full-time care for one child in 2022 (the latest data available).",
      "The rising cost of child care has become a focal point for lawmakers and policymakers amid public concerns about affordability, while some leaders are taking action.

Kathy Hochul earlier this month announced a plan for free child care for 2-year-olds, part of Mamdani's\u00a0broader push to bring universal child care to New York City.",

It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",

      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",

      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota recently lost about 10 prosecutors, some of whom handled criminal cases including the high-profile \"Feeding Our Futures\" fraud investigation. Career prosecutors who remain have largely been sidelined, sources tell CBS.",
      "The Pentagon referred questions to the Justice Department. On Thursday, a Justice Department spokesperson said in statement the department\u00a0\"is laser focused on rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, and has already charged dozens of defendants from Minnesota who've defrauded the American people.\"",
      "\"Ensuring fraudsters, including refugees laundering American tax dollars, are held accountable is a top priority for this Administration, and this whole of government approach will continue until justice is served,\" the statement continued.",

      "The two have publicly sparred after O'Leary said he would not install WiFi gear from Starlink, the Musk-owned maker of satellite internet gear, on Ryanair planes out of concern that the extra weight from the system's antennas would drive up fuel costs.",
      "\"It is a terrific system. It works very well,\" O'Leary said.\u00a0 \"The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost of that of about $200 million, $250 million a year, including the cost of installation and then the fuel drag.\"",
      "Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's SpaceX company developed Starlink to provide internet connectivity, launching its first batch of satellites in 2019.",
      "Ryanair declined to comment. The airline seized on the brouhaha on Tuesday to launch what it called a \"big idiot seat sale,\" offering 100,000 seats for 16.99 Euros for one-way fares.",
      "\"Ryanair is launching a Great idiot seat sale especially for Elon Musk and any other idiots on X,\" Ryanair\u00a0posted\u00a0on X on Tuesday. \"Buy now before Musk gets one!!!\"",
      "O'Leary said Wednesday that Ryanair had explored equipping its jets with Starlink's service, including meeting with executives from the telecom company, but ultimately rejected the idea.",
      "After O'Leary relayed that decision last week, Musk said on social media that the airline leader was \"misinformed.\" O'Leary subsequently told an Irish radio station that \"I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk, he's an idiot.\"",
      "In response, Musk took to X, his social media platform, to deride O'Leary as an \"utter idiot\" and an \"imbecile.\" Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of nearly $700 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 also launched a poll jestingly asking his followers whether he should buy Ryanair \"and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?\"",
      "O'Leary, who has led Ryanair as CEO for more than three decades, said on Wednesday that Musk is free to launch a takeover bid for the airline, while noting that rules bar non-European citizens from owning a majority stake in a European airline.",
      "\"But if he wants to invest in Ryanair, we would think it's a very good investment,\" O'Leary said. \"Certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he's earning on X.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans. Good morning to you.",
      "HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STEVE SCALISE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself. You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours, and your fellow Louisianan Senator Bill Cassidy said the events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job. They're- look we are all, just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago. They have chaos, it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You don't- don't see these numbers either?-- .",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- and so, I wish yesterday didn't happen. What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though, when we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans. I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis, and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin. And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leader's fault. But at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so he- was made a decision not to assist ICE-- .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He was talking- he was talking to- dealing with the federal issues. Because when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76%, homicides down 67%, burglary down 39% year-to-date, sex offenses down, robberies down, motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response- the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, but remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down, and we're seeing that across the country. ICE- look again, anytime something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret. The law says you can't be here illegally and if you're committing violent crimes. The President made it clear, in fact, he was elected. President Trump was elected to get rid of criminals in our communities. 416,000 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because undoubtedly, the President was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it. But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe, almost two thirds of Americans say they dislike the President's approach to his deportation program. There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community? Yes or no? What do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out. In fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment. When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign.\" Do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a concealed carry permit. It's worked very well there. I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime and interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities. You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting, that they were unlawful. Yes, he actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents. Throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah, he wasn't talking about the victim --",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- So, let's tone this down. And-and leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric. I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz said they're Gestapo. He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota, offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things, among them giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs. What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor, but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistle blowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota, and these are stealing programs from learning centers, from disabled students, programs that are being stolen, and the Governor did nothing about it. Congress is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But voter registration logs?--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- Investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand- hand over voter registration logs like, what's the purpose of that to end ICE enforcement?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know- I know we're trying in Congress to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standard, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show a picture ID. Those are things we're pushing for that's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-citizens cannot vote. But I want to ask you ICE- about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said his officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Let's keep in mind that the five year old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --the family--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --protected the child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum, that's- they don't like the app he used to file for asylum.",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, Joe- Joe Biden allowed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And they dispute that he fled--.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But they are retroactively trying to change the legality of the status--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --people from prisons in other countries. President Trump was elected. The number one issue last year was President Trump saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Absolutely--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- I'm going to secure the border, and he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. 416,000--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --criminals- illegals have been arrested by ICE. 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people, by the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 47% of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions. 47%.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --ICE just put up a website. Not ICE, Homeland Security, worst of the worst DHS. Go Google worst of the worst DHS. State by state, they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state, you can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --or the two year old who was separated from her mother.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --that father was here illegally and abandoned his child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "LEADER SCALISE:\u00a0 --Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: 416,000 people with violent criminal records. These are people- and by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 in part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. 416,000 have been removed. Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No and I don't think--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They do, indeed--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: And local law enforcement, local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. That's a felony to interfere with law enforcement--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot, and that's why we are asking the questions--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Yeah, and we don't have that chaos in other cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -about the tax payer funded federal--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --Minneapolis has its own problems--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --failed leadership that has led to a lot of this, and it's unfortunate it happened. I wish it didn't happen. Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:17:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Those who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust have been called the Righteous Among the Nations. One such rescuer, an American, was Varian Fry, who helped organize artist Marc Chagall's escape from France, for both him and his paintings.",
    "story": [
      "Marc Chagall once commented if he wasn't Jewish, he might not have been an artist. His faith profoundly influenced his works like \"The Praying Jew,\" for example, as well as a never-before-seen work that Chagall gave to his granddaughter, Bella Meyer.",
      "\"He tells the story of Shabbat, from back of his memories,\" Meyer said of the drawing.",
      "She recalled watching her grandfather work: \"I watched him paint, and I loved it. I adored him.\"",
      "But her grandfather's faith also got him in trouble. In Russia where he was born, Chagall was jailed for not having his Jewish residency papers. He later moved to Paris. \"France, for him, meant freedom,\" said Meyer \u2013 freedom, that is, until the Nazis marched into Paris in 1940.",
      "\"For him he was French, rather than Jew,\" Meyer said.",
      "The Nazis didn't see it that way. They considered Chagall's work \"degenerate art.\" In 1941, the Vichy police tracked him down in Marseilles in the south of France and detained him yet again. Had it not been for the courage of strangers \u2013 non-Jews mostly, who risked their own lives to help smuggle him and his paintings to safety \u2013 that might have been the last we ever heard about Marc Chagall.",
      "Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, has a name for such rescuers: The Righteous Among the Nations. There weren't that many righteous rescuers, however; it's easier to discount horror with blind eyes than it is with eyes wide open. Compared to six million murdered Jews, there are fewer than 30,000 non-Jews who have been recognized for helping.",
      "Using taped and transcribed interviews from the U.S. Holocaust Museum, filmmaker Nick Davis brought 45 extraordinary stories of those non-Jews who did help to life.",
      "\"One of them said, you know, he didn't care whether they were Jewish or Catholic or Eskimos; they were persecuted people, and you had to help,\" Davis said.",
      "His film is called \"This Ordinary Thing.\"",
      "\"We have paid enough attention to the bad guys \u2013 Hitler, Himmler, G\u00f6ring \u2013 and we don't think as much about the good people who helped.\" \u2013 Tina Strobos, The Netherlands",
      "\"On a sort of superficial level, I felt like, 'Ugh, haven't we seen enough Holocaust films?'\" Davis said. \"But when I looked at the stories that we were going to be telling, real goodness is what you do when no one's looking.\"",
      "Oscar-winner Hellen Mirren voices the sacrifices of Irene Gut Opdyke, of Poland, who was forced to become the mistress of an elderly SS officer to buy his silence after he discovered that she was hiding Jews in his villa.",
      "\"I won't tell you it was easy. Not only because he was an old man, but I knew there were 12 lives depending on me \u2026 I never talked about what I did during the war. And I still wouldn't, had I not read that article in the newspaper that said the Holocaust didn't happen.\" \u2013 Irene Gut Opdyke",
      "Alex and Mela Roslan sheltered three Jewish brothers in Warsaw. They couldn't call a doctor if things were bad for fear of being discovered. What happened with them, and far too many others, is dramatized by Jeremy Irons:",
      "\"He says, 'I would feel better if you held me.' I picked him up, and he died in my arms. We buried him in the basement sitting up, because someone told me that was the way to bury a Jew. \" \u2013 Alex Roslan, Poland",
      "Dwork believes whatever the motivation of rescuers was, in the case of the Holocaust, the end often justified the means.",
      "I asked, \"So, there really isn't necessarily a line that connects them all, other than the fact that they must've had good souls?\"",
      "\"Sometimes they didn't even have good souls!\" said Dwork. \"Sometimes greed motivated them. And I say three cheers for greed, because it was thanks to the greed that they put their lives at risk, or put themselves in harm's way.\"",
      "Her latest book, \"Saints and Liars: The Story of Americans Who Saved Refugees from the Nazis\" (W.W. Norton), is about American relief workers who helped save Jewish refugees. Most of the Americans you've likely never heard of. \"Think about it: The best known of the Americans is Varian Fry, and very few people know about him,\" she said.",
      "Varian Fry brings us full circle, for he was the man who helped organize Marc Chagall's escape from France. He was the first American to be given the title of The Righteous Among the Nations. His son, James, accepted the honor on his dad's behalf.",
      "Asked why he thinks his father wasn't recognized more, James Fry replied, \"I think the country wanted to move on, and focus on rebuilding, getting life back to normal. People didn't want to remember, I guess.\"",
      "Varian Fry rarely talked about his time during the war, although Chagall paintings sometimes mysteriously appeared in the Fry household, presumably as a thank-you.",
      "In retrospect, James says his dad suffered from outsized bouts of righteous indignation, to the point he believes his dad's bravery may have sprung in part from his being bi-polar. \"I think he harnessed sort of his manic energy to do something that most people would've thought not worth trying,\" he said.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "This interview was recorded on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So a lot is going on in the relationship between our two countries. We are so deeply integrated here on trade, you buy more from the U.S. than any other country. We have the world's longest land border. We have shared defense interests through NATO, shared air defense with NORAD. Are we like in the middle of a divorce? Like, how do you describe the relationship?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- I- we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in- in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time, that you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is- are important, that looking out for each other in important ways is- is a number one priority. I think in some quarters, Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through, I have no doubt about that, but it's yeah, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, you know, Canada had agreed to join this Board of Peace that President Trump announced out at Davos, and then overnight Thursday, the president disinvited Canada. Is this kind of public snub interfering in the relationship, and- and what does that indicate to you about what this Board of Peace is that Canada had said it did want to be a part of?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "So we had expressed an interest in the Board of Peace a number of weeks ago, and essentially, a Board of Peace that is seeking to find peace, in particular, in Gaza and stability, is something that Canada was very much supportive of. The- the parameters of that Board of Peace had just really started to come out and- and our government was considering it, but hadn't- hadn't really made a decision. But I think that- that honestly, I think that the most important thing to say here, from the perspective of Canada, is that we have always and will always be promoting peace and stability and human rights around the world. We'll do it with our allies in various fora, at NATO, at the U.N. bilaterally with like minded countries. So we're not going to change that and- and we will give it our all in- in any fora that- that is available to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It- It's kind of now described as an alternative to the United Nations. Is that something you're comfortable with?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, we are deep supporters of the United Nations. We feel that it's, you know, it's not perfect, no large institution is, but having a place where the whole world can get together and express their views on issues that are important to the globe is vital. And as I say, NATO is vital, and we work with our EU counterparts and EU-Canada, you know, security discussions and in- in various other configurations. So probably all of these different fora are- are essential. The Board of Peace has yet to be fully, I think, understood, and we'll see- we'll- we'll see where that goes, but the outcomes are what matter to Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So your prime minister gave a national address on Thursday, and I understand he denounced authoritarianism and exclusion. He did not mention President Trump by name, but he did rebuke the claim that Trump made at Davos, that Canada lives because of the United States. You're talking about what people receive at home, everyone has local politics, so when something like that is said, do you fear that this is starting not just a spat, but this is like a generational split between our two countries, like, how are people receiving this at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, I think Canadians- Canadians know that Canada lives because of Canadians, because what Canadians do for Canada, and right now, that's where we're trying to focus our attention. By doing what- you know, focusing our attention on what we can control as a nation for ourselves and our own economy and our own security and our own relationships around the world. The United States is always going to be a vital partner. Geography, as you said in your opener, 5,500 miles of border, deep ties, millions of Canadians and Americans that work together every day, that- that you know, do research and study and have families across the border so that- that is there, and that is something that I actually think brings strength to the relationship at times where, you know, in other- at other levels, and maybe at the political level, it- it's more complicated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It's very complicated. I mean, it- it's almost unthinkable that a phrase like authoritarianism and exclusion that that could be thought to be referring to the leader of the president of the United States?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, I think that there are concerns globally for- by our government, that we have institutions and norms, rules that have governed our countries, yours, mine, and all like minded countries for generations that are really being tested, really being tested. And- and I think what matters is how we react in the face of these tests, and for us, for our country, for our prime minister, you know, there are important implications for our country. And he's- he's trying to articulate a vision. And I think he is articulating a very strong vision for how we must adapt. And again, it's- it's about being pragmatic and principled, and that's- that's what we're going to continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You have had a long career here in the United States, deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration. President Trump was asked about it, January 13. He said, I really don't care in terms of renewing it, there's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here. Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico did broad consultations, national consultations, with their business communities in particular, on what- how that agreement works for them. And really without exception, the American comments back were sure we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit, but job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world. So I think there's- I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people in the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up, and they're saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So do you think there's a bilateral trade deal here? Is that what the Trump administration is going for, rather than the three way deal or--",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- you know, I think- I- I- we hear- we hear that sometimes, we hear different things. It is important to remember that even within that agreement, there are a lot of bilateral elements, but there is- there are advantages to doing things trilaterally. There's a lot of supply chain movement that happens between our three countries. And if you, if you break it into two, you could have different rules and disconnects there that are inefficient for business. So we're driven- look, Canada will be driven by what the best thing to do is, as I say, for the companies and constituencies that are relying on that agreement to create jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean, these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago, your prime minister was in Beijing, and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented, and it's very difficult. So that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean, the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values, and stand up to China. That seems dead, if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well, I think- I think we have to put this in perspective. The- the agreement that we did with China a few weeks ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely, or almost exclusively, designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from one of their primary markets, if not for some of them, their primary market. And so we went to Beijing to re-establish market access for our farmers and our fishers. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they re-established market access for U.S. soy farmers, and in exchange, rolled back some tariffs and fees. So this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But even Ontario's premier said this is letting Chinese \"spy cars\" into your country. I think he means electric vehicles that will be cheaply made in China. Are you worried about becoming too beholden to China and its cheap manufacturing?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, we're not, because, we- the- the auto side of this agreement was again to take us back to 2023, we had the importation of vehicles made in China. Many of those were Teslas, as a matter of fact, and we've gone back and stuck to the level of 2023 for those imports. So this isn't a revolutionary new thing. This is really just trying to roll back or de-escalate what had been escalated over the past year and a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, the treasury secretary is saying that Albertans are going to have a referendum on succeeding from Canada. He seems to be urging that. What do you make of this--",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and comments like that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: I think it's important to let Albertans and Canadians manage their own very delicate domestic, you know, politics themselves. I think that that's probably wise counsel. Having grown up in Alberta, you know, it's a- it's a- it's a province that has lots of strong views about the way in which it interacts with the rest of the country, as do other parts of our nation. And those are important debates to be had, but they're debates for our country to have within its own citizenry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems to be stirring the pot there a bit, but I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos. He got a standing ovation for this speech. He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "MARK CARNEY, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think he laid out in his- his discussion, his speech, his- his view of what is happening in our world. And it's- it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stability and- and maximize economic reality. So we're moving away our economic benefits, and we're moving away from that, and we have to- countries like ours, have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles. We can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by by everyone if they commit to them. But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic and we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies, and part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world, in trade agreements, in investment relationships and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sounds like Canada is picking off our friends.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I- no, I think Canada is trying to make sure that it is the most resilient it can be for our own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that President Trump posted on social media just a few moments ago that Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China. That's how it was described to me. Yet President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built, but it's supposed to be missile- layered missile defense, as I understand it. Do you know what he's talking about, that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't, but what I can say about the Golden Dome is this, Canada is- is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defens-, in our defense systems, and a big part of that is Arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over-the-horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive. So that is part- and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug in to the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Right. Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems, where we're interoperable. We- we work together. We make our investments that make sense for Canada and defending our territory and defending our sovereignty, but we work with the Americans and- and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in- in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense, but you're on board to help do that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO, because you're also a partner at NATO. The only time that NATO's Article 5 was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Here's what President Trump said.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action. What is a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done, and I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true, and that's what matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time as it wraps up here in Washington.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Great to have you. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara. Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF, BRIAN O'HARA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened. Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened. Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a, in a law enforcement involved shooting, just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims. Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are, are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is",
      "this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that is the state agency that investigates use of force incidents--",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They are separate from your police force.",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves. I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city. So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just- there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already- the impression is left?",
      "O'HARA: People have had enough. This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out. This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "O'HARA: We understand that for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening. It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening. These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him. You said that Pretti- you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any, any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we checked the Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "O'HARA: Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun. \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\" The FBI director said, \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\" Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm, and there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of, shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions. He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly. He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "O'HARA: Well, that- what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police involved shootings from the scene. So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines, but- but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance if someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry. The only question would be if they were using the weapon in a- for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities. The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job. About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there. We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3000 as we understand it. The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that if those policies weren't in place, these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations, that none of this would really be happening. How do you respond to that claim that because of the sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades, and it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail that's at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "O'HARA: Yeah. I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard. As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis Police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin stretched as it is, and we have a job to do, trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office who had resigned. We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good. What is local law enforcement experiencing beyond your officers, but in the U.S. Attorney's Office, in your local FBI?",
      "O'HARA: I mean the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city. We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so- it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.\u00a0 Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. ANGUS KING: Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state, ICE just launched this operation \"Catch of the Day,\" which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants, among others, targeting 1400 criminal aliens who have quote, unquote, terrorized communities in Maine. What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SEN. KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us- and by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established. They list 13 people in Maine. They concede that- or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are- I'm sorry, 87. My math is off. But the point is this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record, including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the at the- at the county jail. So this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the President. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me, I have to submit my questions in writing, and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be- I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers. But this- here's the real problem, Margaret, the people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking we're- we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets. Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their- to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this, and it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these- by these heavy handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of getting to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully, one of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it- job at the border. But they also point to Sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, you put your finger on it. Margaret in the last interview, the question is not, should we enforce the law? Should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals? The question is, how is it done? I did a little research this morning. Obama during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals, but you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I've never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from, the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and and we're having these incidents all over the country, so it's not necessary- you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and- and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SEN. KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last- the end of the last shutdown, but I can't vote for a bill that includes ace funding under the circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. There's an easy way out, by the way, Leader Thune could separate, which is what they did in the house, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS. And by the way, if those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's your path to avoid a shutdown. But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric in Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement, they're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: I guess I technically would, but I don't- again- well, let me, let me put it in the words of the sheriff in- in Cumberland County, Maine when they took one of his recruits, he called it 'bush league policing.' And I think that sort of summarizes it and- and there's no need for this overwhelming show of force. I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people. Again, armed people with masks and- and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing, and intimidating protesters. That's- that's not America. And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment. These people are acting outside the Constitution. They're ignoring our laws, and we just can't keep- keep supporting that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator King, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:37:37 -0500",
    "summary": "President's Trump's designs on acquiring the world's largest island \"one way or the other\" have stirred feelings of betrayal among Danes and Greenlanders. Mo Rocca gives us a history lesson about an island that is 80 percent covered in ice.",
    "story": [
      "This past week Greenland was big in the news. Of course, Greenland has always been big. Three times the size of Texas, the world's largest island dominates the arctic space between North America and Europe. Its name notwithstanding, 80 percent of Greenland is covered in ice.",
      "The name Greenland came about as a case of branding, according to Robert Christian Thomsen, a professor of social sciences at Aalborg University in Denmark. Greenland got its name, he says, from Erik the Red, a Viking who came from Iceland and settled there around 985 A.D. Upon returning to Iceland, \"He told the old Norse that lived there, 'There's a magnificent green land to the west of here. You should go, you should come and join us,'\" Thomsen said.",
      "In 1814, Greenland officially became part of the Kingdom of Denmark. So, why all the attention to this mostly desolate landscape?",
      "First, there's security: \"If you look at a map, you'll see that the shortest distance for a missile to travel between Moscow and Washington is immediately over the North Pole and Greenland,\" Thomsen said.",
      "And climate change has made Greenland even more coveted \u2013 more navigable for commercial and military vessels, and easier for mining its rich resources.",
      "\"The receding ice means that there's much more, much better access to oil, to gas, to minerals, including the rare earth elements that are needed for our computers, for our electric cars, for batteries,\" Thomsen said.",
      "American interest in Greenland isn't new. During the 19th century, around the time we bought Alaska from Russia, the U.S. expressed interest in acquiring Greenland. Nothing materialized.",
      "But in 1917 the U.S. did buy territory from Denmark: the three islands in the Caribbean that are today's U.S. Virgin Islands. In return, the United States recognized Danish sovereignty over Greenland.",
      "Then came World War II.",
      "Thomsen said the island was tremendously important to the Allies during the war: \"Denmark is already occupied by the Germans. And so, Greenland is sort of floating out there unprotected. The American administration said, 'We need to occupy Greenland to make sure that the Germans do not do it.'\"",
      "The Allies used the island as a refueling hub for military bombers. After the war, in 1951, the U.S. and Denmark agreed to a more permanent arrangement which, Thomsen said, states that \"The U.S. pretty much has free access [to Greenland]. It can do whatever it wants in terms of establishing military bases, radar, you name it. The U.S. just has to ask politely.\"",
      "But enough about its location and resources. Greenland of course also has people \u2013 a tiny population of about 57,000.",
      "Tillie Martinussen, a native Greenlander and former member of parliament, said growing up in Greenland was wonderful: \"I mean, it's a very, very safe country to grow up in. We're frolicking about in the snow.\"",
      "Martinussen, like almost 90% of the population, is of Inuit descent. Asked what Greenlandic values are, she replied, \"They are we have to take care of each other. We have to stand together. \u00a0Very much community-driven, as opposed to most of the Western countries, which are a lot individually-driven. We live in a society where only two generations ago we're used to people going out hunting to get their food, and we are used to sharing. It's kind of still a state of mind.\"",
      "While polls show most Greenlanders don't want to be American, Martinussen says it's nothing personal: \"I actually love the United States; I love the American people,\" she said. \"Don't get me wrong at all. I mean, one of my dreams was actually going from east to west there in a car.\"",
      "But after President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on Greenland and longtime ally Denmark [\"One way or the other, we're gonna have Greenland\"], that love is being sorely tested.",
      "Martinussen said, \"We have been good allies for 80 years, which makes this treachery feeling so strong in us right now. Children that we have now are going to grow up and being afraid of the United States as the aggressor that we remember.\"",
      "Thomsen said, \"There is a sense, I think, of betrayal. I grew up with \u2013 and most Danes I think grew up with \u2013 the notion that the U.S. is our best friend in the world, you know? So to, all of a sudden, realize that the bad guy, the one who wants to take something away from us and to hurt this state and these people, is not the Russians, is not China, but our best friend.\"",

    "summary": "The Falun Gong dance troupe produces what it describes as a vision of \"China before communism.\" The touring company says it's been targeted by Beijing. Now former performers are suing, alleging forced labor and untreated injuries, allegations Shen Yun disputes.",
    "story": [
      "Deep in the woods of New York State, behind guarded gates, lies a vision of ancient China reborn \u2013 a private sanctuary called Dragon Springs, 400 acres where faith and art share the same stage. It is the creative center of Shen Yun, the epic stage production of Chinese history, legends, and politics.",
      "\"We are putting on stage the tyranny of the CCP,\" said Ying Chen, a vice president and conductor with Shen Yun.",
      "The Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, calls the group behind Shen Yun an evil cult. Known as Falun Gong, it's a spiritual movement rooted in Buddhism. In 1992, founder Li Hongzhi started teaching Falun Gong's meditation exercises, which spread quickly throughout China.",
      "And Beijing responded. In 1999, China banned the religious group, referring to it as \"public enemy number one\" for challenging communist rule.",
      "Ying Chen says practitioners were imprisoned and tortured, including her own family. \"My mom and my brother was sent to a labor camp,\" she said, \"and he endured 18 months of agony, and his survival was a fragile miracle. He was literally tortured every single day.\"",
      "Founder Li Hongzhi settled in the U.S., and in 2006 launched Shen Yun. It would ask much of his followers, including Jeff Sun and Ashley Cheng, who both grew up in Falun Gong families. \"Li Hongzhi made it quite clear that Shen Yun was the highest form of how practitioners can support the movement,\" said Cheng.",
      "Their parents had sent them in the late 2000s to a boarding school at Dragon Springs where young performers train for Shen Yun. We spoke with Sun and Cheng, now married, from their home in New Zealand.",
      "\"The entire community I grew up in was very proud of me,\" Cheng said. \"They thought it was a great honor to live with Li Hongzhi in that compound.",
      "Sun said attending Shen Yun was \"as if, like, I made it to Harvard.\"",
      "He was 15, she was 13 \u2026\u00a0 nearly 9,000 miles from home. According to Cheng, \"Everything was very isolated, and our main job is to dance.\"",
      "Regarding contact with the world outside Dragon Springs, Cheng said that, if their parents asked any questions, \"we had to tell that we were happy, that Master (which is Li Hongzhi) was taking great care of us.\"",
      "The reality, Sun and Cheng claim, was they were part of a group of child laborers living in constant fear.",
      "\"I was in survival mode,\" said Cheng. \"It's about not exceeding 100 pounds every day. It's about following the footsteps of the person in front of me so I don't get yelled out of line.\"",
      "Sun said, \"There's no one we can talk to. The adults there who are your educators, [are] also your persecutors. You want to speak how you feel to them but the next day you get told that you're thinking different to everybody else, that you are the problem.\"",
      "That was the weight of the mind. The body, they say, would bear its own. \"Two kids kind of pushed my legs open in the side split, and it was the most amount of pain I'd ever experienced, ever,\" Sun said. \"I had internal bleeding. My entire inside of my leg, both legs, was purple. But every day I still had to do the same thing.\"",
      "Cheng said, \"My shoulder was stretched for [an] abnormal amount of time once, and I lost all feeling in it. So, I had issues, from showering to going to the bathroom.\"",
      "She said, when telling her instructors about her injuries, \"I was faced with an eye roll. I have not had or seen a single pill of medicine during my entire duration.\"",
      "Sun and Cheng are part of a growing group of former dancers contending that medical care was discouraged, a belief they say is rooted in Falun Gong teachings. \"Any injury that you have, if you mention that you want to go the hospital, or if you wanted help, it will be denied,\" Cheng said. \"And it will be quickly, very quickly associated to, 'You got injured because you disobeyed Li Hongzhi \u2026 It is your fault.'\"",
      "In 2015 they were kicked out of Shen Yun. Last spring they sued, one of two federal lawsuits against the performance group alleging forced labor.",
      "Describing his time with Shen Yun, Sun said, \"Every time I think about what happened to me, it kinda breaks me apart, you know? And nobody deserves this. I mean, we're all kids, you know? We wanted to impress our parents. We wanted to do what we thought was right.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" asked Shen Yun about these allegations \u2013 and they invited us into Dragon Springs, where spokeswoman Ying Chen showed us around.",
      "We observed young men and women in total quiet. \"It's a little bit like praying,\" said Chen. \"We settle down our minds and try to purge distracting thoughts, and just stay really focused.\"",
      "As to why men and women were sitting on opposite sides of the room, Chen said, \"We have very conservative values in the school. So, we usually keep them separate.\"",
      "Asked why Shen Yun invited the media into Dragon Springs \u2013 which they have not done until now \u2013 Chen said, \"I think part of it is because they talk about a compound. Does it look like a compound? I think it's true that we work hard. This is a place that provides top-level dance training, and also it's a faith-based community.\"",
      "Asked to respond to plaintiffs' accusation that they were denied medical attention they may have needed, Chen replied, \"I cannot speak to what they went through. But I just find it very shocking and very different from the practice here and our policies here.\"",
      "Regarding the suggestion that the Chinese government is behind the lawsuits, Chen said, \"These lawsuits emerge at a time when Beijing escalated its global campaign against Shen Yun. It's really hard to see it as a mere coincidence.\"",
      "And just this month, the Chinese Embassy called Shen Yun \"a cult's propaganda,\" using \"culture as cover\" to \"deliver indoctrination.\"",
      "Shen Yun company members Regina Dong, Shindy Cai, and Piotr Huang were also sent as teenagers to Dragon Springs.",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to fast-track a ban on social media for teenagers under 15.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants his government to fast-track the legal process to ensure that a ban on social media for children under the age of 15 can enter into force in September at the start of the next school year.",
      "In a video released late Saturday by French broadcaster BFM-TV, Macron said he had asked his government to initiate an accelerated procedure so that the proposed legislation can move as quickly as possible and be passed by the Senate in time.",
      "\"The brains of our children and our teenagers are not for sale,\" Macron said. \"The emotions of our children and our teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated. Neither by American platforms, nor by Chinese algorithms.\"",
      "Macron's announcement came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",
      "According to France's health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "Macron's office told The Associated Press that the video was addressed to lawmaker Laure Miller, who is sponsoring the bill that will be examined in a public session on Monday.",
      "\"We are banning social media for under-15s, and we are going to ban mobile phones in our high schools,\" Macron said. \"I believe this is a clear rule. Clear for our teenagers, clear for families, clear for teachers, and we are moving forward.\"",
      "Australia recently implemented the world's first social media ban for teens younger than 16, with its government urging Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, X and Youtube to take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders from their platforms if they don't meet the age requirement. Since then, social media companies have blocked access to about 4.7 million Australian accounts that were identified as belonging to kids under 16, officials said.",
      "The law in Australia provoked fraught debates about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health. It has also prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Peter Malinauskas, the premiere of the state of South Australia, previously told CBS News that officials from North America, Europe and Asia had spoken with him about pushing forward similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is poised to become the second country to institute a social media ban for kids under 16 this year.",

    "story": [
      "Climber Alex Honnold has completed a free solo ascent of Taipei 101 in Taiwan, not using any ropes to scale the massive 1,667-foot skyscraper \u2014 and he did it live, as the world watched on with bated breath and hearts racing.",
      "It took Honnold 1 hour and 31 minutes to climb the 101-floor tower and spire on Sunday. The event was livestreamed on Netflix.",
      "\"It's windy,\" Honnold said at the top before taking a selfie. \"I'm so psyched ... And you know what, pretty tired actually.\"",
      "Honnold's climb was originally slated for the previous day, Jan. 23, but was postponed due to bad weather, Netflix said. \"I suppose climbing is always at the mercy of nature, that's just how it goes,\" Honnold said in a\u00a0video posted on social media.",
      "Ahead of the climb, Honnold told Netflix's Tudum fan site he expected viewers to \"probably be on edge watching this,\" but that he hoped they \"get a little bit of my joy from the experience \u2014 that they can appreciate the fun of it and the beauty of it, the scenery, just the whole experience.\"",
      "Taipei 101 is one of the\u00a0tallest skyscrapers in the world. The building was designed by C.Y. Lee & Partners and opened in 2004. It's home to observatories, restaurants, a shopping mall and offices, as well as the Taiwan Stock Exchange.",
      "Frenchman Alain Robert scaled the tower as part of its opening. Robert used ropes, and it took him more than four hours, Honnold told Tudum. \"I think, if I do this, it'll be the biggest urban free solo ever,\" he added.",
      "Honnold also famously climbed El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear in June 2017. El Capitan is a roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall \u2014 more than twice the height of the Empire State Building \u2014 in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California. His incredible feat was captured in the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "That free solo up the Freerider route took Honnold 3 hours and 56 minutes. The following year, Honnold and fellow climber Tommy Caldwell climbed El Capitan's Nose route in 1 hour, 58 minutes and 7 seconds, shattering the previous speed record and breaking the two-hour barrier.",
      "In a \"Note to Self\" on \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018, Honnold reflected on what it took to climb El Capitan without any ropes, telling his 18-year-old self: \"Right now, you're afraid of so many things: strangers, girls, vegetables, falling to your death. That's fine; fear is a perfectly natural part of life. You will always feel fear.\"",
      "\"But over time you will realize that the only way to truly manage your fears is to broaden your comfort zone,\" he said. \"It's a long, slow process that requires constantly pushing yourself, but eventually you'll feel pretty darn good, and you'll climb big walls just like this.\"",

      "President Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America's northern neighbor went ahead with its trade deal with China.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a social media post that if Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"",
      "\"If Canada makes a  deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "While Mr. Trump has waged a trade war over the past year, Canada this month negotiated a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower import taxes on Canadian farm products.",

      "Carney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president's push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance. Mr. Trump had commented while in Davos, Switzerland, this week that \"Canada lives because of the United States.\" Carney shot back that his nation can be an example that the world does not have to bend toward autocratic tendencies.",
      "Mr. Trump later revoked his invitation to Carney to join the president's Board of Peace that he is forming to try to resolve global conflicts. The president announced the move in a message to Carney on\u00a0Truth Social, saying the Board of Peace \"is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed the United States as a 51st state.",
      "He resumed that this week, posting an altered image on social media showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",
      "In his message Saturday, Mr. Trump continued his provocations by calling Canada's leader \"Governor Carney.\" Mr. Trump had used the same nickname for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and his use of it toward Carney was the latest mark of their soured relationship.",
      "Carney has not yet reached a deal with Mr. Trump to reduce some of the tariffs that he has imposed on key sectors of the Canadian economy. But Canada has been protected by the heaviest impact of Trump's tariffs by the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. That trade agreement is up for a review this year.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security disputes a Minnesota school district's claims that ICE agents used a 5-year-old boy as bait before taking the boy and his father into custody Wednesday.",
      "The Columbia Heights Public School District says 5-year-old Liam Ramos was taken with his father while in their driveway after just arriving home from his preschool classroom. School officials claimed the child was used by agents to knock on the door and ask to be let in, letting officers see if anyone else was home.",
      "As community outrage grew, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed that \"ICE did NOT target a child,\" and said he was instead abandoned by his father. They say his father fled federal agents as they approached his vehicle, leaving the child.",
      "DHS officials allege that the father, whom they described as an illegal immigrant from Ecuador, was taken into custody as other ICE officers stayed with the child.",
      "\"For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended (the father),\" DHS officials said.",
      "School officials say a nearby adult on the scene offered to take the child, but ICE agents did not allow that.",
      "Later Thursday, McLaughlin went further, calling the framing of the incident as ICE using the child as \"bait,\" claims made earlier by the child's school district, were \"a horrific smear.\"",
      "\"Our officer's made multiple attempts to get the alleged mother who was inside the house to take custody of her child. Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody. The alleged mother refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him,\" McLaughlin said. \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement.\"",
      "An attorney for the Ramos family said they had entered the U.S. through a port of entry in 2024 using the CPB app and had requested asylum.",
      "\"Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they've been asked to do,\" Marc Prokosch, the family's lawyer, said of the family's asylum claim. \"So this is just cruelty.\"",
      "The Ecuadorian government said its consulate in Minneapolis contacted ICE as soon as it got word that Liam was being held, adding that it is \"monitoring the situation of the child in order to safeguard their safety and well-being.\"",
      "Ella Sullivan, Liam's teacher, described him as \"kind and loving.\"",
      "\"His classmates miss him,\" she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.\"",
      "Columbia Heights officials say that Ramos and his family are not alone. The district says three other students have been taken by federal agents, including a 17-year-old boy who was reportedly removed from his car on his way to school, and a 10-year-old elementary schooler who was taken alongside her mother two weeks earlier.",
      "The district says that both the child and her parents, along with Liam Ramos and his father, are now being held in a detention center in Texas.",
      "Minnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 \"of some of the most dangerous offenders\" have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.",

    "story": [
      "The Coast Guard and a tanker crew rescued a rower whose boat capsized while he was competing in a 3,000-mile race across the Atlantic, the agency said in a news release. He reported that he had been in distress for about 24 hours.",
      "Benoit Bourguet, 47, was in a single-man rowing vessel named the City of Liverpool, the Coast Guard said. Bourguet, a Belgium citizen, was competing in the World's Toughest Row Race, which spans 3,000 miles from Spain to Antigua. His boat was reportedly capsized by \"two rogue waves,\" forcing him to deploy a life raft. He was about 1,275 miles east of Puerto Rico.",
      "Watchstanders at the Coast Guard Sector San Juan Command Center in Puerto Rico received two emergency distress alerts overnight Wednesday. The first, recorded around 2 a.m., came from the City of Liverpool. The second came from a personal beacon device in the same location. The Coast Guard determined that the vessel had been part of the race and reached out to race organizers, who said they had sent Bourguet several messages but not received a response. Another team in the race also could not contact Bourguet.",
      "A tanker called the Horten was traveling about 110 miles from the distress signal. The Coast Guard issued an Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue callout to the tanker. These callouts are used by search and rescue agencies around the world to assist people who are in distress at sea, according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The tanker, traveling from Germany to Guyana, diverted off-course. It took the ship over 12 hours to reach the distress signal's position, the Coast Guard said. During that time, Coast Guard officers remained in contact with the crew.",
      "Finally, the Horten arrived in the vicinity of the distress signal and spotted Bourguet's life raft. They were able to use a life ring to safely bring him aboard the tanker. Photos from the rescue show Bourguet's orange life raft with his boat tied to it.",
      "Bourguet was \"dehydrated but otherwise in good health,\" the Coast Guard said.",
      "The Horten's crew and race coordinators would arrange from Bourguet to be transferred from the tanker \"at a later time,\" according to the Coast Guard. No other vessels in the World's Toughest Row Race have been reported to be in distress, the agency said.",
      "The Coast Guard said the incident served as a reminder of the importance of having a functional personal distress beacon that is properly registered with nautical authorities. Zodiac Maritime, the managing company of the Horten, said it was \"immensely proud of our crew, whose professionalism, exemplary display of good seamanship in challenging circumstances and close coordination with the United States Coast Guard, helped save a life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "Mr. Trump called it an \"ultimate long-term deal\" on Greenland, saying it's \"really fantastic for the USA, gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security.\"",

      "U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new framework could include a new NATO \"Arctic Sentry\" security partnership.",
      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that.

      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Jan. 4, claiming \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said, \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "Would Trump use military force to take Greenland?",

      "\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But, I won't do that. Okay?\" he said in his address on Jan. 21. \"Now everyone's saying 'oh, good.' That's probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:03:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end.",
    "story": [
      "Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, posing a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study says.",
      "Three different penguin species \u2014 the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo \u2014 are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study\u00a0published Tuesday in the Journal of Animal Ecology. The change in habits is setting up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. Between 2012 and 2022, temperatures in the breeding grounds increased by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "\"Penguins are changing the time at which they're breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\" said lead study author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.\"",
      "The researchers said it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Winners and loses in a warming world",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species, at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical for survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. The birds used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species, creating competition. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up her observations, she said.",
      "\"Chinstraps are declining globally,\" Martinez said. \"Models show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it's very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\"",
      "Other factors threaten penguin populations",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \"you have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\" which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",
      "This shift in breeding timing \"is an interesting signal of change and now it's important to continue observing these penguin populations to see if these changes have negative impacts on their populations,\" said Michelle LaRue, a professor of Antarctic marine science at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. She was not part of the Oxford study.",
      "With millions of photos \u2014 taken every hour by 77 cameras for 10 years \u2014 scientists enlisted everyday people to help tag breeding activity using the Penguin Watch website.",
      "\"We've had over 9 million of our images annotated via Penguin Watch,\" Suttle said. \"A lot of that does come down to the fact that people just love penguins so much. They're very cute. They're on all the Christmas cards. People say, 'Oh, they look like little waiters in tuxedos.'\"",
      "Other penguin species in Antarctica are facing trouble. Researchers from the\u00a0British Antarctic Survey\u00a0and University of Southampton said last June that the continent's emperor penguin population may be declining faster than even the most pessimistic predictions. Images showed the species, recognizable by their height and yellow patches, declined in Antarctica by 22% between 2009 and 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.",
      "Belle Burden was born into a life of wealth and luxury, but after a painful divorce brought on by her husband's affair, she learned just how quickly that security could be taken away.",
      "In her new memoir, \"Strangers: A Memoir of Marriage,\" Burden writes in detail about the prenup her lawyer advised against, how her former husband threatened to only give her the bare minimum in child support after giving up custody of their children and how she managed to navigate the painful ordeal while adjusting to her new normal.",
      "As the daughter of Carter Burden, a descendant of the Vanderbilts who built his own broadcasting company, and Amanda Burden, an urban planner who was the daughter of socialite Babe Paley, Belle was independently wealthy when she met Henry Davis, the man she would marry.",
      "NEW YORK HEIRESS BELLE BURDEN'S EX-HUSBAND GAVE UP CUSTODY OF CHILDREN AFTER AFFAIR TORE FAMILY APART: MEMOIR",
      "Belle Burden and Henry Davis married in 1999, leaving her after an affair in 2020. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "Davis, who Burden refers to in her book as \"James,\" wasn't in a similar position. He was a lawyer at the time, as was Burden, and his family did have money when he was growing up, but, she wrote, \"At some point in the 1970s, his father had a breakdown, was laid off, and stopped working.\"",
      "His parents used savings to cover costs, and when he was in law school, they divorced, and he learned there was no money left. \u00a0Burden said there was one part of the story she never heard fully about his father abandoning the family for a time, \"maybe after an affair,\" before coming back for a number of years before his mother filed for divorce.",
      "While she could never figure out the details, she said the matter of his father and the family's financial struggles stuck with him.",
      "\"He told me how much he wanted to be a husband and father,\" Burden said. \"He told me how much he wanted an honorable life.\"",
      "Three months after their first kiss, he proposed, and, during their engagement, they rented an apartment together and split costs equally. A few months before their 1999 wedding, Burden's mother reminded her she needed to get a prenup written up, something both she and her brother had contractually agreed to in their early 20s.",
      "\"All of my assets were in trust, entirely protected in case of divorce, whether we had a prenup or not. I didn\u2019t think I needed it. But I had committed to having one,\" she wrote.",
      "In the original draft her family lawyer sent, she and James would each keep the assets they brought into the marriage but would split everything earned during the course of the marriage in case of divorce. She recalled James being \"upset\" by the idea, telling her it made him feel \"like an outsider, a threat,\" and she felt guilty for asking him to sign it.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Belle Burden's book was released earlier this month. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "Just weeks before the wedding, the pressure to sign the prenup increased, and James suggested to her that they tweak the agreement so that anything earned during the marriage would not be split if they divorced, but that anything in both of their names would. With him at her side, she called her lawyer, Tom.",
      "\"Tom told me it was a bad idea; it was standard to share in what was earned during a marriage, both by James and by me,\" she wrote. She insisted on doing it James' way, and finally Tom agreed. She never told her family about the change to the standard prenuptial agreement, worried they would \"intervene.\"",
      "In 2001, they bought a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, something that was \"much bigger\" than she thought they needed, but that James loved. She emptied one of her two trusts to purchase it and listed James as a joint owner, \"even though he had not contributed to the purchase.\" She said she was happy to do it.",
      "A few years later, she used her second trust to purchase a summer home in Martha's Vineyard. James had gone to look at it alone, and he'd loved it, so she wired him the funds from the trust, emptying it completely, and, as with the apartment, she made sure James was listed as a joint owner of the property.",
      "In 2002, they welcomed their first child, with their second and third coming in 2004 and 2007. Burden wrote that James was excited about each and involved with her pregnancies, but after their second child was born, he was promoted to president at his investment firm and began pulling away from daily parenting duties.",
      "Burden shares three children with her ex-husband. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "\"We had made an unspoken bargain: he would work all the time and I would take care of the kids all the time,\" she explained. \"I resented this sometimes, usually when I was stressed, when one of the kids was sick, or when they were melting down over something. But most of the time, I liked his fervent commitment to his work.\"",
      "As her children got older, she began taking on some pro bono immigration cases but never went back to paid work. She did receive a job offer in 2012, but James dismissed it immediately when she brought it up, telling her she needed to be available for the kids. At first, she recalled being upset that he didn't even discuss it with her, but the feeling passed quickly, believing he was right, that the family \"needed to prioritize James' career.\" She turned down the offer.",
      "Burden said, as the years went by, she and James discussed getting rid of their prenup \"since it was no longer fair\" to her. She'd used her trusts to purchase their homes, and his career had flourished while she gave hers up to raise their children.",
      "In July 2019, they had a meeting scheduled with their lawyer to do just that, but James suggested just before the meeting that they \"table\" the prenup issue and focus on their wills, telling her that he wanted to leave everything to her directly instead of in trusts for their three children.",
      "Less than a year later, she discovered he was having an affair.",
      "Belle Burden is the daughter of Carter Burden, descendant of the Vanderbilt family and a prominent businessman in his own right, and Amanda Burden, a prominent urban planner. (Horst P. Horst/Conde Nast via Getty Images)",
      "It was in 2020, when the family was spending the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown in their Martha's Vineyard home, that she received a voicemail from a man who claimed his wife was having an affair with James. When she confronted James, he admitted everything, and the next morning, he told her he wanted a divorce.",
      "He left the home without saying goodbye to the children. Her son, who was 17 at the time, was staying on Long Island with friends, but their daughters, who were 15 and 12, were sleeping when he left.",
      "In a phone conversation later that day, she said he told her, \"I thought I was happy, but I\u2019m not. I thought I wanted our life, but I don\u2019t\" and \"I feel like a switch has flipped. I\u2019m done.\"",
      "She also recalled him telling her, \"You can have the house and the apartment. You can have custody of the kids. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want any of it.\"",
      "James continued paying the family's bills, and he maintained that he didn't want any official custody of the children, believing they were old enough to decide when they wanted to see him.",
      "NEW YORK HEIRESS BELLE BURDEN RECOUNTS THE VOICEMAIL THAT TORCHED HER HUSBAND'S DOUBLE LIFE: MEMOIR",
      "It wasn't until January 2021, when, as part of the divorce proceedings, Burden received documents detailing James' earnings over the years, that she realized just how much wealth her soon-to-be ex-husband had accrued over the years. She also realized how their altered prenup, the one she wanted against her lawyer's advice, put her at a disadvantage.",
      "She wrote, \"Now James could claim his ownership stake in both properties. He could walk away with his assets. He could become a partner at a hedge fund, where his wealth would increase exponentially, unencumbered by me.\"",
      "Burden is also the granddaughter of New York socialite Babe Paley. (Getty Images)",
      "Her lawyer began preparing a counterclaim. She knew she didn't have much of a shot with the prenup designed the way it was, but she and her lawyer both felt she had to try. Her stepmother, Susan, warned her that James might get \"angry\" over the counterclaim, and Burden admitted that \"it would be easier, safer\" to let the divorce play out and to trust James \"would be fair to me in the end.\"",
      "Still, she questioned why she should trust him and admitted to feeling \"an almost nihilistic desire to set flame to the remaining structures of my former life, to the very safety I clung to, to the fiction that I could depend on anyone other than myself for protection, to the idea that being quiet was the only way to be good.\"",
      "Six months later, a judge dismissed the counterclaim and enforced the prenup, then set a trial date to resolve the issue of child support and their joint property. James, Burden wrote, hadn't brought up her counterclaim in the months after she initially filed it, but after it was dismissed, he was \"inflamed by it.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"He said he would give me only the minimum child support required by law,\" she claimed. \"He said I would have to face the consequences of the prenup, of my failed counterclaim.\"",
      "Soon after, James' lawyer wrote her a letter, assuming that she'd want to buy James out of his interest in their two homes. She couldn't afford that, so she began coming to terms with the idea that she'd have to sell both. It was then, she recalled, that things became \"very dark.\"",
      "She grappled with the idea of her children losing the homes they'd known all their lives and with losing what her family had left to her, as well as her own financial security.",
      "\"There was no reason for it, given James\u2019s resources, given his desire to shed, given his refusal to make a home for the kids,\" she wrote. \"It felt like he was playing a game, or running a deal, one he was going to win at all costs, by a wide margin, regardless of the impact on me and our children.\"",
      "In the end, an hour before their trial was to begin, Burden and James reached a settlement on their own. He negotiated the terms, and she said that she \"had to be calm, deferential, grateful,\" and that if she got her lawyer involved or \"pushed him,\" he would withdraw the offer altogether.",
      "Burden, with stepmother Susan and her former husband, was able to keep both homes she purchased with her trusts. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "He gave up his interest in the two properties they owned and agreed to child support and to pay the children's medical expenses and school tuition. Meanwhile, he'd keep all the money he'd earned throughout their marriage.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what finally made him decide to settle,\" Burden admitted. \"I have several guesses, but I will never know for sure. Maybe he always planned to resolve it before trial, to give me the house and the apartment. But only after he brought me to my knees.\"",
      "She said when she signed the agreement, she tried to let everything go and that she's been mostly successful. These days, she doesn't think about the money or the details of the split, but there are some things about the divorce that chill her.",

      "\"It is the possibility that there was a timetable, a clock I didn\u2019t hear ticking,\" she wrote. \"It is his willingness to make me afraid when I was already devastated, already on the floor.",
      "\"It is what he made clear within weeks of leaving, that he believed my contributions to his career, to our family, over twenty years, amounted to nothing.\"",

      "A longtime Democratic operative who worked for top party figures before jumping into private ventures with the now-husband of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Tim Mynett, is back in the spotlight as swindling allegations resurface and Congress investigates Omar's skyrocketing net worth via her husband's companies, according to her financial disclosures.",
      "William Hailer and Mynett, who met working for now-Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison when he was in Congress, were both political operatives before they turned to venture capitalism and the wine industry. Hailer was a senior advisor to former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and also has an extensive history working for Ellison, who was the DNC co-chair. Between consulting fees and reimbursements, Hailer raked in over $250,000 advising the DNC and Ellison, according to FEC filings.",

      "Through these business ventures, which include wine and cannabis, Hailer left a trail of fraud and swindling allegations tied to eSt Ventures, which was co-founded by Hailer and Mynett, and the subsequently formed Badlands Fund, which was created to control another investment fund that the pair also created called Badlands Ventures.",

      "The lawsuit claims that the pair solicited donations from local South Dakota cannabis growers who had been raising money among their friends and family. Hailer allegedly promised them that he already had big investors lined up, and would bring in multi-millions more if the local growers forked over around $3.5 million.",
      "However, the additional investment never appeared to materialize despite months of promises that the funds were not far away, according to court complaints. While the money has since been returned, according to public reporting, the defendants claimed that after signing a proposed settlement they were still struggling to get the full amount that they gave to Hailer back. Hailer returned $1.86 million in August 2022 and another $500,000 in October 2023, while the final settlement in 2024 got the remaining $1.2 million back to the investors that was still missing.",
      "The cannabis investors' attorney eventually said the dispute was settled \"amicably.\" Meanwhile, local media questioned how Hailer was able to pay the money back considering discovery documents in the case reportedly showed he had less than $750 combined across various business and personal bank accounts.",
      "Following the cannabis incident, Hailer and Mynett faced further allegations of fraud related to their California wine business, eStCru, which saw its valuation jump from between just $15,000 to $50,000 in 2023 to between $1 million and $5 million in 2024.",
      "The winery first appeared on Omar's disclosure reports after she and Mynett tied the knot in 2020 and the massive valuation jump comes just five years after Hailer complained that eStCru could barely keep the lights on during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"ESTCRU LLC like many wineries is living invoice to invoice, sale to sale, to stay afloat given the economic conditions of the industry,\" Hailer told the Minnesota Reformer in response to more fraud allegations against him and his wine business with Mynett.",

      "The restaurant owner, Naeem Mohd, wired $300,000 to Hailer and Mynett, but alleged he never received the 200% returns in 18 months that the pair promised him, arguing the pair knew that the promises were false.

      "Amid the scrutiny into the firm's massive jump in valuation shown in Congresswoman Omar's most recent financial filings, the firm co-founded by Hailer and Mynett came under fire for scrubbing their firm's website of various high-profile individuals that it claimed were its advisors.

The fraud has involved various social services and welfare schemes, including Medicare and childcare funding, and many of those convicted have been part of Minnesota's ballooning Somali population.",

It also comes as the Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government is rapidly approaching. Further complicating matters is the arctic storm ripping across the country, which has already forced the upper chamber to cancel votes on Monday.",

      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",
      "Researchers, however, have raised questions about how quickly patches reach users and how much visibility Google has into real-world abuse that does not involve Google hardware. They also argue that weaknesses in certification allowed flawed implementations to reach the market at scale, suggesting broader systemic issues.",
      "For now, both Google and the researchers agree on one key point. Users must install manufacturer firmware updates to be protected, and availability may vary by device and brand.",
      "SMART HOME HACKING FEARS: WHAT\u2019S REAL AND WHAT\u2019S HYPE",
      "Unwanted tracking notification showing the victim's own device. (KU Leuven)",
      "How to reduce your risk right now",
      "You cannot disable Fast Pair entirely, but you can lower your exposure.",
      "If you use a Bluetooth accessory that supports Google Fast Pair, including wireless earbuds, headphones or speakers, you may be affected. The researchers created a public lookup tool that lets you search for your specific device model and see whether it is vulnerable. Checking your device is a simple first step before deciding what actions to take. Visit whisperpair.eu/vulnerable-devices to see if your device is on the list.",
      "Install the official app from your headphone or speaker manufacturer. Check for firmware updates and apply them promptly.",
      "Pair new devices in private spaces. Avoid pairing in airports, caf\u00e9s or gyms where strangers are nearby.",
      "Unexpected audio interruptions, strange sounds or dropped connections are warning signs.\u00a0 A factory reset can remove unauthorized pairings, but it does not fix the underlying vulnerability. A firmware update is still required.",
      "Bluetooth only needs to be on during active use. Turning off Bluetooth when not in use limits exposure, but it does not eliminate the underlying risk if the device remains unpatched.",
      "Always factory reset used headphones or speakers before pairing them. This removes hidden links and account associations.",
      "Investigate Find Hub or Apple tracking alerts, even if they appear to reference your own device.",
      "Install operating system updates promptly. Platform patches can block exploit paths even when accessories lag behind.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "WhisperPair shows how small shortcuts can lead to large privacy failures. Headphones feel harmless. Yet, they contain microphones, radios and software that need care and updates. Ignoring them leaves a blind spot that attackers are happy to exploit. Staying secure now means paying attention to the devices you once took for granted.",

      "Designed to break down safely",
      "Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety. The MIT team took a different approach. Nearly all parts of the antenna break down in the stomach within days. Only a tiny off-the-shelf RF chip remains, and it passes naturally through the body.

      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "FOX Weather meteorologist Bayne Froney joins 'America's Newsroom' in Dallas, Texas as the first signs of a massive winter storm begin to show. Texas is preparing accordingly following the devastating winter storm five years ago.",
      "Weather forecasters are warning that a major winter storm is expected to impact large portions of the United States starting Friday. Forecasts call for snow, freezing rain and ice stretching from Texas and the Southern Plains through the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast. This system is concerning because it combines ice accumulation, gusty winds and plunging temperatures. In many regions, especially across the South and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, infrastructure is not designed to handle prolonged ice events.",
      "That increases the risk of extended power outages and disrupted cell service. When the grid goes down, everyday tech becomes critical. Phones, alerts, vehicles and apps may be your only connection to updates and emergency help. Preparing now matters far more than reacting later.",

      "Why ice storms are especially disruptive",
      "Ice storms cause more damage than most people expect. Unlike snow, ice sticks to everything and adds significant weight. Ice builds up on trees and power lines, causing branches to snap and lines to fall. Utility crews often cannot begin repairs until conditions improve, which delays restoration. Forecasters at Fox Weather warn that freezing rain across the South and interior Southeast could be particularly damaging, while snow and wind farther north may slow emergency response.",

      "The breach went undetected for days, giving attackers ample time to move through internal systems and steal sensitive data. If you've ever paid at the pump or shopped inside one of these convenience stores, this is the kind of incident that should make you stop and pay attention.",

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.

      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",

      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson takes a look at the Mercedes Vision V luxury van and its 65-inch screen, 42 speakers and first-class comfort.",
      "Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A California startup wants to flip that idea on its head.",
      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",
      "The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your personal space.",

      "How Pliyt's autonomous pods work",
      "One-way glass and independent controls keep each rider anonymous, even when the vehicle is shared. (Pliyt)",
      "Pliyt's vehicle is designed from the inside out. Each passenger rides inside a self-contained capsule that prioritizes privacy, comfort and control. The company says the idea resonated strongly when the prototype debuted at CES earlier this month. Here is what sets the concept apart:",
      "BLUE-CITY RIDERS HIT WITH PRICIEST UBER FARES AS LA, NYC COSTS SOAR PAST COMPARABLE METROS, DATA SHOWS",

      "Independent lighting, sound and privacy controls",
      "Personalized entertainment for gaming, streaming or screencasting",
      "A retractable workstation with a large display and a side table",
      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",
      "A view of autonomous vehicle PLIYT at the CES (Consumer Electronic Show) 2026, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade on Jan. 6, 2026 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas.\u00a0 (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Online shopping feels familiar and fast, but a hidden threat continues to operate behind the scenes.",
      "Researchers are tracking a long-running web skimming campaign that targets businesses connected to major payment networks. Web skimming is a technique where criminals secretly add malicious code to checkout pages so they can steal payment details as shoppers type them in.",
      "These attacks work quietly inside the browser and often leave no obvious signs. Most victims only discover the problem after unauthorized charges appear on their statements.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",
      "Which payment providers are being targeted?",
      "Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:",
      "American ExpressDiners ClubDiscover, a subsidiary of Capital OneJCB Co., Ltd.MastercardUnionPay",
      "American Express",
      "Diners Club",
      "Discover, a subsidiary of Capital One",

      "700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS",
      "Criminals use hidden code to copy payment data while the purchase still goes through normally. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",
      "Merchants whose checkout pages are compromised",
      "Payment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "This shared exposure makes detection slower and response more difficult.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "Simple protections like virtual cards and transaction alerts can limit damage and expose fraud faster. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe as a shopper",
      "While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.",
      "Virtual and single-use cards are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:",
      "Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps",
      "Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.",
      "Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers",
      "A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.",
      "Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.",
      "Use strong, unique passwords for banking and card portals to reduce the risk of account takeover. A password manager helps generate and store them securely.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Strong antivirus software can block connections to malicious domains used to collect skimmed data and warn you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data removal services can reduce how much personal information is exposed online, making it harder for criminals to pair stolen card data with full identity details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Apple and Google have entered a multiyear AI partnership that will shape the future of Apple Intelligence and Siri. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",

      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems.

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OKIf they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third dayThe alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OK",
      "If they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third day",
      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",

      "Reconsidering the app's name",
      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning about a growing cyber threat that turns everyday QR codes into spying tools.",
      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",

      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some quishing sites collect device and location data even if you do nothing. A data removal service helps reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. That makes it harder for attackers to target you with convincing spear phishing emails that include QR codes.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Illinois residents are once again being reminded how fragile government data systems can be. The Illinois Department of Human Services has confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records belonging to roughly 700,000 people.",
      "The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.",

      "The Illinois Department of Human Services confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records tied to roughly 700,000 residents, including Medicaid and disability services recipients. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "What happened in the Illinois DHS data breach",
      "As spotted by Bleeping Computer, the Illinois Department of Human Services disclosed that unauthorized access to one of its systems led to the exposure of records tied to approximately 700,000 Illinois residents. The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.",
      "According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.",
      "For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",

These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new credit entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is often the safest option.",
      "Once your information leaks, it often spreads to data broker sites that sell personal details. Personal data removal services work to request takedowns and reduce how much of your information is publicly available. While they can't erase everything, they significantly lower your exposure.",

      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy.

      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks.

      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

      "This FDA approval feels like a real turning point. For years, brain stimulation for depression stayed locked inside clinics. Now it can happen at home with a doctor still guiding the process. That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with. And for many people living with depression, having another option could make all the difference.",

      "A new bill proposed by Democrats in the Virginia state legislature is raising concerns regarding the removal of minimum prison sentences for various violent felony crimes.",
      "Within days of Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger being sworn in, members of her party introduced a flurry of amendments looking to end mandatory minimum sentences for various crimes within the state.",
      "According to Jason Miyares, the former Republican attorney general, House Bill 863 includes proposals to effectively eliminate minimum sentencing for manslaughter, rape, possession and distribution of child pornography, assaulting a law enforcement officer and other repeat violent felonies.",

      "\"HB 863 is a common-sense proposal that eliminates the requirement for one-size-fits-all minimum sentences for certain crimes,\" Delegate Rae Cousins, who sponsored the bill, said, according to ABC 7.",
      "\"This change would give the experienced judges in our communities more discretion to make decisions based on the unique facts of each case.

      "However, law enforcement experts are pushing back against the bill while expressing concerns about how the possibility of more lenient sentencing could impact victims of violent crimes.",
      "\"From a law enforcement standpoint, I think police generally want offenders to be held accountable, and frustration among law enforcement officers grows when individuals are released quickly and subsequently re-offend \u2013 and even more so if it involved a violent felony,\" law enforcement expert Josh Ederheimer told Fox News Digital. I think that also tracks the thinking of many members of the public.\u00a0 I think there is more tolerance for flexibility for minor offenses.",
      "Virginia Beach police respond to a shooting on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, in Virginia Beach, Va.\u00a0 (Stephen M. Katz/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)",
      "Ederheimer, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Center for Public Safety and Justice and a retired law enforcement officer, went on to explain that police typically understand unique circumstances that can point to a defendant receiving a lesser sentence, but frustration still exists surrounding more serious crimes.",
      "\"For violent felonies, however, the biggest practical concern is that the defendant will re-offend, and that the public is not alerted or aware that the defendant has returned to the community. It\u2019s an accountability concern that falls on the shoulders of judges and prosecutors.\"",

      "The proposed bill would allow courts to hand down sentences based on the individual facts of each case, rather than statutory mandates implemented by the state\u2019s government. However, it does not impact maximum penalties in such cases.",
      "Ederheimer further explained that the bill could have a negative impact on victims and their families regarding accountability for violent offenders.",
      "\"I think that the police and public alike have expectations that convicted criminals will be held accountable, and that full sentences should be served,\" Ederheimer said. \"Mandatory minimums assure victims \u2013 and the community \u2013 that a convicted person will serve their sentence.\"",

      "\"It is the circumstance when convicted felons are released early that victims may feel a sense of betrayal or that justice was not served. That\u2019s the dilemma.\"",
      "The bill is set to be reviewed by the House and Senate Justice Committees, where it will likely be amended.",
      "However, Ederheimer added that mandatory minimum sentences may not actually encourage violent offenders not to commit crimes, further adding to the complex balance of maintaining justice and community safety.",
      "\"From a law enforcement perspective, I don\u2019t think mandatory minimums serve as a deterrent,\" Ederheimer told Fox News Digital. \"I think that largely defendants are not focused on repercussions at the time of their offense.\"",

      "This past week, the second-highest-ranking officer at U.S. Africa Command, a former U.S. Special Forces leader who served in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. John Brennan, U.S. Army, was as a key member of a U.S. delegation to Nigeria. Speaking exclusively to Fox News Digital from Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, Brennan detailed U.S. moves on the ground to combat Islamic State and other jihadi terror groups.",
      "Brennan gave Fox News Digital insight into the U.S. military\u2019s role now in Nigeria: \"We are continuing to provide them (the Nigerians) intelligence support, airborne ISR, (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), things that will make them more accurate. And they had some success in Sokoto post-strike because of the activity that the strike generated across the network.\"",
      "The general continued, \"A lot of terrorists decided to flee the area, and it allowed the Nigerians the opportunity to arrest them.\" But he added, \"We're all about enabling Nigerians to solve Nigerian problems. We want to ensure that they remain a security anchor for all of West Africa and they do too. And so it's in our mutual interest that we work together.\"",

He added, \"and (when) I say target, I mean these armed men, people or groups, their camps have been hit, and eventually afflicting damage to them. They are on the run now. Fleeing in different directions. Some sources say some have fled, maybe to neighboring Niger and others south and in different locations across Nigeria.\"",
      "Djadi continued, \"All these years, they have been acting and attacking with relative total impunity. But this has changed now. They are scared now. They are hit, and they realize they can be hit again. So this is the symbolism.\"",

      "At the meeting, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Allison Hooker told those present, \"Today we are here to\u00a0 determine how we can work together to deter violence against Christian communities, prioritizing counterterrorism and insecurity, investigating attacks, holding perpetrators accountable and reducing the number of killings, forced displacements and abductions of Christians.\"",
      "The meeting took place in Abuja. Just over 80 miles away, four days earlier, the abduction of Christians continued, with over 160 worshipers\u00a0kidnapped from three churches in northern Kaduna state, it is believed, during Sunday services.",

      "This week, when asked if further strikes are possible, a U.S. defense official told Fox News Digital, \"That's a question for the White House. But I can tell you our Nigerian partners are asking for more of our help. And so we're going to give it to them.\"",
      "There are some American boots on the ground, but their numbers are not significant, Brennan said, adding, \"a lot of assessment (is) going on.

      "Ibrahim added, \"We have noted, through our own intelligence and battlefield evidence, that such external kinetic actions can disrupt command structures, degrade logistics and create atmospherics of uncertainty among the remnants of groups like ISWAP and Boko Haram.\" \"Our cooperation with the United States is robust, multifaceted and transcends mere rhetoric,\" Ibrahim continued, saying it is focused\u00a0on key areas, including \"capacity building and training: Nigerian units, particularly in intelligence, aviation and special operations, have received advanced training that directly enhances their operational effectiveness in theater.\"",

      "\u201cI never thought Donald Trump and Stephen Miller would be the ones to finally force me into being a defender of the 2nd Amendment,\u201d liberal commentator Mehdi Hasan wrote of the president and the White House deputy chief of staff in a post to X.",
      "The instantaneous political realignment \u2014 which may be temporary \u2014 comes as polls show that the public has become less enamored of Trump\u2019s mass-deportation campaign and of the federal agencies carrying it out with force in American cities. The shooting of an American citizen, captured on video from several angles, acted as a flashpoint for a larger debate over whether there are, or should be, any limits on the administration\u2019s power to execute Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be the case that exercising a right protected by the U.S. Constitution exposes you to killing or arrest,\u201d said Bruce Fein, a constitutional lawyer who served as a Justice Department official in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and has criticized their successors. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this is vast government overreach. It\u2019s not just killing. They also go into homes without proper warrants.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump or any other Republican can patch up the schism between those who prioritize enforcing immigration law over gun rights and those who believe there is little, if anything, that is worth eroding the Second Amendment for.",
      "For generations, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of Republican warnings about giving too much power to the federal government: Without it, many on the right argue, a Democratic president would seize Americans\u2019 guns as a first step toward totalitarianism.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, then the executive director of the NRA, wrote in a fundraising letter following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.",
      "Charlie Kirk, the late co-founder of the young conservative group Turning Point USA who was killed by an assassin\u2019s bullet last year, explained his view in similar terms in 2023: \u201cThe Second Amendment is not about hunting. I love hunting. The Second Amendment is not even about personal defense. That is important. The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government.\u201d",
      "Even Noem has articulated that point of view in the past, telling an NRA conference in 2023 that \u201cJoe Biden and the liberals want our guns\u201d because \u201cit will make it easier for them to infringe on all of our other rights.\u201d Additionally, the first law Noem signed when she was governor of South Dakota allowed residents of that state to carry concealed weapons without a permit.",
      "Conversely, Democrats have fought for just as long \u2014 in state legislatures, Congress and federal courts \u2014 to impose restrictions on firearms, who can own them and where they can be carried. These limitations, major gun-control groups and many Democratic lawmakers contend, protect the public. In 2020, liberals excoriated conservatives for celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who shot and killed two people during demonstrations against police violence in Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges against him.",
      "After his acquittal, Trump met with Rittenhouse, calling him a \u201cnice young man\u201d and defending his decision to shoot.",
      "And yet on Saturday, as some shared memes of Rittenhouse to accuse Republicans of hypocrisy, progressives found themselves promoting the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to bear arms.",
      "\u201cFor years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,\u201d former Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., wrote on X. \u201cToday I apologize, because I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\u201d",
      "Fein, the constitutional lawyer, said that Pretti\u2019s shooting, and the administration\u2019s defense of it, are even at odds with the arguments the Justice Department is making in favor of gun rights at the Supreme Court right now.",
      "\u201cThe hypocrisy has reached an incredible level,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "A number of pro-gun rights Republicans pushed back on the administration's argument that Alex Pretti was dangerous because he had a gun. Pretti was legally licensed to carry one.",
    "story": [
      "A war of words over deeply held beliefs erupted on the political right in the hours after a federal agent shot and killed Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street Saturday, pitting top officials in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration against Second Amendment defenders in his electoral base.",
      "At the core of the debate is that Pretti \u2014 who was permitted to carry a gun in public in Minnesota \u2014 had a concealed firearm on his person that eyewitness videos show federal agents apparently discovering and removing during the altercation that led to his death. Videos do not appear to show Pretti holding the weapon during that confrontation.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sought to justify the killing by asserting at a news conference that Pretti \u201cattacked those officers, had a weapon on him, and multiple dozens of rounds of ammunition, wishing to inflict harm on these officers coming, brandishing like that and impeding their work that they were doing.\u201d No evidence has been provided to back up this account.",
      "Follow live Minneapolis updates here.",
      "Noem argued that his possession of a firearm demonstrated that he did not intend to remain peaceful.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign,\u201d Noem said on Saturday.",
      "On Sunday, when asked on Fox News if it is protocol to use deadly force on a disarmed person, Noem said, \u201cThat\u2019s all part of this investigation.\u201d",
      "The attempt to explain Pretti\u2019s killing by noting that he had a gun has also been mentioned by Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others.",
      "In a few moments, Pretti\u2019s killing turned some Trump supporters, including members of his administration, against generations of conservative orthodoxy on the Second Amendment. At the same time, it appeared to serve as a wake-up call for gun-rights activists that a Republican-run government, not just a Democratic-run one, could infringe on the Second Amendment.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "An instructive exchange played out on X. Bill Essayli, a federal prosecutor in California appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, infuriated gun-rights activists with a series of posts expressing similar sentiments to Noem\u2019s \u2014 \u201cIf you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you\u201d \u2014 and accusing critics of being members of antifa.",
      "None of that sat well with defenders of the Second Amendment, who are accustomed to having their right to bear arms challenged by Democrats, not Republicans.",
      "\u201cOh I\u2019m Antifa now?\u201d Aidan Johnston, the director of federal affairs for the Gun Owners of America, wrote on X in response to Essayli. \u201cI guess @TheJusticeDept is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW [concealed carry weapons] permit holders get executed for \u2018approaching\u2019 law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The National Rifle Association attacked Essayli for \u201cdemonizing law-abiding citizens.\u201d",
      "But the group, which has long sparred with Democratic presidents, noticeably held back from criticizing the Trump administration too directly. Instead, in a post on X, it essentially blamed \u201cradical progressive politicians\u201d like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, for causing the situation, saying they \u201chave incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs.\u201d",

      "And the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus took issue with Patel saying on Fox News on Sunday, \u201cYou cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It\u2019s that simple. You don\u2019t have that right to break the law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is completely incorrect on Minnesota law. There is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota,\u201d the caucus wrote on X.",
      "Asked about the concerns of gun-rights advocates, the White House referred NBC News to remarks made by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino in a Sunday-morning interview with CNN.",
      "\u201cWe respect Second Amendment rights, but those rights don\u2019t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers,\u201d Bovino said.",
      "The debate has seemingly created a nascent set of progressive defenders of gun rights.",
      "\u201cI never thought Donald Trump and Stephen Miller would be the ones to finally force me into being a defender of the 2nd Amendment,\u201d liberal commentator Mehdi Hasan wrote of the president and the White House deputy chief of staff in a post to X.",
      "The instantaneous political realignment \u2014 which may be temporary \u2014 comes as polls show that the public has become less enamored of Trump\u2019s mass-deportation campaign and of the federal agencies carrying it out with force in American cities. The shooting of an American citizen, captured on video from several angles, acted as a flashpoint for a larger debate over whether there are, or should be, any limits on the administration\u2019s power to execute Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be the case that exercising a right protected by the U.S. Constitution exposes you to killing or arrest,\u201d said Bruce Fein, a constitutional lawyer who served as a Justice Department official in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and has criticized their successors. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this is vast government overreach. It\u2019s not just killing. They also go into homes without proper warrants.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump or any other Republican can patch up the schism between those who prioritize enforcing immigration law over gun rights and those who believe there is little, if anything, that is worth eroding the Second Amendment for.",
      "For generations, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of Republican warnings about giving too much power to the federal government: Without it, many on the right argue, a Democratic president would seize Americans\u2019 guns as a first step toward totalitarianism.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, then the executive director of the NRA, wrote in a fundraising letter following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.",
      "Charlie Kirk, the late co-founder of the young conservative group Turning Point USA who was killed by an assassin\u2019s bullet last year, explained his view in similar terms in 2023: \u201cThe Second Amendment is not about hunting. I love hunting. The Second Amendment is not even about personal defense. That is important. The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government.\u201d",
      "Even Noem has articulated that point of view in the past, telling an NRA conference in 2023 that \u201cJoe Biden and the liberals want our guns\u201d because \u201cit will make it easier for them to infringe on all of our other rights.\u201d Additionally, the first law Noem signed when she was governor of South Dakota allowed residents of that state to carry concealed weapons without a permit.",
      "Conversely, Democrats have fought for just as long \u2014 in state legislatures, Congress and federal courts \u2014 to impose restrictions on firearms, who can own them and where they can be carried. These limitations, major gun-control groups and many Democratic lawmakers contend, protect the public. In 2020, liberals excoriated conservatives for celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who shot and killed two people during demonstrations against police violence in Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges against him.",
      "After his acquittal, Trump met with Rittenhouse, calling him a \u201cnice young man\u201d and defending his decision to shoot.",
      "And yet on Saturday, as some shared memes of Rittenhouse to accuse Republicans of hypocrisy, progressives found themselves promoting the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to bear arms.",
      "\u201cFor years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,\u201d former Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., wrote on X. \u201cToday I apologize, because I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\u201d",
      "Fein, the constitutional lawyer, said that Pretti\u2019s shooting, and the administration\u2019s defense of it, are even at odds with the arguments the Justice Department is making in favor of gun rights at the Supreme Court right now.",
      "\u201cThe hypocrisy has reached an incredible level,\u201d he said."

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift called \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor Justin Baldoni an expletive in a text message with Blake Lively, according to messages unsealed Tuesday as part of an ongoing legal battle.",
      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",
      "Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Swift licensed a song for \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d but was not otherwise involved in the film, Swift\u2019s spokesperson said last year, when there was an attempt to subpoena her as a possible witness in the trial.",
      "Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively\u2019s legal team, said Tuesday that the new filing includes \u201cdamning\u201d statements about Baldoni from other people.",
      "\u201cThe newly unsealed, damning documents show the consistent reaction numerous women, cast, crew, executives, partners, co-host and even his own PR team had working with Justin Baldoni,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement released by Wayfarer\u2019s public relations team that they are confident Baldoni\u2019s name will be cleared.",
      "\u201cAs stated all along, and reflected in our clients motions, as well as in messages from Sony discussing Ms. Lively\u2019s behaviors, the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law,\u201d Freedman said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing by Lively\u2019s lawyers deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

      "For Grody, a self-proclaimed lover of people, the podcast also allows her to make new friends.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for them, and I\u2019m thrilled for us,\u201d Patinkin says. \u201cThat piece, when I did it, you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re living it, you don\u2019t see it. The first time I saw it was when other people did it. So I cannot wait to see these wonderful gifted performers, actors do this. It will be such a thrill for us all.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my bias, but I\u2019m thrilled that a new generation will be able to see it and have that encouragement about life and art.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her bedroom as a 14-year-old in 2002, her 9-year-old sister was in the room and heard the kidnapper\u2019s voice when he threatened her if she alerted their parents.",
      "Months later, Mary Katherine Smart\u2019s ability to place a name with the voice became a major break in the case as police searched tirelessly to find her older sister. Mary Katherine remembered the voice of a man who briefly worked on her family\u2019s Salt Lake City home and police identified as Brian David Mitchell.",
      "Related: Where Is Elizabeth Smart Now? A New Documentary Details Her Abduction",
      "Mary Katherine\u2019s crucial role in Smart\u2019s ultimate rescue is examined in the new Netflix documentary \u201cKidnapped: Elizabeth Smart.\u201d",
      "In an exclusive interview on TODAY on Jan. 21, Elizabeth Smart reflected on the important role Mary Katherine played in her story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Smart said. \u201cShe saved me.\u201d",
      "The documentary recounts how authorities initially investigated members of Smart\u2019s family, including her father, as well as a former contractor who worked on the house, as they searched for the abductor. Both were dead ends, but Mary Katherine\u2019s remembrance of the man whose voice she heard proved to be invaluable information.",
      "Mary Katherine appears in the documentary, where she describes her inability to sleep after the abduction and feeling like she was \u201calone on an island\u201d because police did not want her speaking to anyone about the crime.",
      "\u201cHad she not remembered who had kidnapped me, who\u2019s to say that I would be here today?\u201d Elizabeth Smart said on TODAY. \u201cThe police all had their suspects, and my captor I don\u2019t even think was on their radar at all. So she is my hero.\u201d",
      "Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from her bedroom in her family\u2019s home by Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. The couple took Smart to a tent in the mountains outside Salt Lake City, where Smart said Mitchell raped and tortured her nearly every day of the nine months she was held captive.",
      "She was rescued on March 12, 2003, when two couples called the police believing they had just seen Elizabeth Smart after recognizing Mitchell and Barzee from an episode of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d",
      "Mitchell is currently serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee, who was sentenced to 15 years for her role in the kidnapping, was released from a Utah prison in 2018. She was then arrested in May 2025 for visiting two Salt Lake City parks, which violated her status as a sex offender.",
      "Smart, 38, has since become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. She also has helped other kidnapping victims recover and shined a spotlight on other survivors of abduction.",
      "In 2023, she marked 20 years since being rescued with a message of gratitude. She opened up about what it\u2019s like when people approach her to thank her for sharing her story or admire her perseverance.",
      "\u201cInitially it was so shocking because that was not me,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cI was happy to blend in. I wasn\u2019t anybody, and so that was very overwhelming when I first got home. And then I would also say it was surprising just like how long and how many people still remembered my story.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd now it\u2019s been 20-plus years, and so it\u2019s not uncommon to have people come up and approach me, but I guess even sitting here 20-plus years later is surprising,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would never have imagined this for my life. I never would\u2019ve thought my life would go in this direction.\u201d",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour. Smart spoke about whether she has talked to her daughters Chloe, 10, and Olivia, 8, and son James, 6, about her story.",
      "\u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I was given as far as parenting goes: When your kids start asking questions, that\u2019s the right time to start talking about it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cAnd honestly, that started way before I was prepared, way before I ever thought it would come up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think my oldest was, like 3 years old when she started asking me questions, like where was I going, what was I doing, why was I doing it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd that was shocking. I was not ready. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still ready. But I would say that opened the door to start having those conversations, and then just as they have grown, I\u2019ve been able to let that conversation grow as well.\u201d"

      "Major Western allies chose to skip the ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with some voicing concerns that the body, which Trump plans to chair personally, could replace the United Nations.",
      "Trump, who has derided the U.N. for \"empty words\" that \u201cdon\u2019t solve war,\u201d said Thursday that the two bodies will work alongside each other, after having suggested earlier in the week that the board \"might\" replace it.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, has been plunged into the worst winter energy crisis since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago, as relentless strikes on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure take their toll.",
      "Two weeks after a massive Russian attack obliterated the power grid in the capital and cities across the country, Kyiv\u2019s residents are still in the grip of power and heat blackouts amid a bitter cold snap, with night temperatures last week dipping as low as minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit and remaining below freezing this week.",

      "\u201cYou just lose hope that things can improve,\u201d Kyiv resident and humanitarian worker Nataliia Rychka told NBC News. \u201cSuch a long stretch without power takes away a sense of agency from you \u2014 being able to do very simple things, like making food for yourself, cleaning your home or showering, it\u2019s emotionally difficult.\u201d",
      "Kyiv, like the rest of Ukraine, is not new to rolling outages as Russia pursues a strategy of targeting its energy grid each winter. But the extensive repairs required after the Jan. 9 strike have meant that power has to be cut at random, leaving people in the dark \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 about when electricity might come back on."

      "The find, along with others recently made in the Southeast Asian country, helps scientists trying to determine when and where early humans first learned to make art and at what point their art became more complex.",
      "The reddish hand stencils, though faded and barely visible, were found in the Liang Metanduno limestone cave on Muna, an island off the larger eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. One of them was found to be at least 67,800 years old.",
      "Indonesian and Australian researchers said the stencils were made by blowing pigment onto a hand pressed against the rock surface, leaving an outline. Fingertips reshaped to appear more pointed suggest that the hands were those of humans, possibly connected to the ancestors of the first Australians.",
      "The paintings were dated by analyzing mineral crusts that had gradually formed on top of them.",
      "The finding \u201cis pretty extraordinary, because usually rock art is very difficult to date and it doesn\u2019t date back to anywhere near that old,\u201d said Adam Brumm, a professor of archaeology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, and a co-author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature."

In recent days the Trump administration has also withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of other international organizations, including global climate talks, and established a Board of Peace chaired by Trump that critics say could undermine the United Nations.",

      "The president used his own speech to row back suggestions that he might use military force against NATO allies to take Greenland, which he repeatedly referred to as \"Iceland\" \u2014 a different country \u2014 during the address.",
      "\"I won't use force,\" he told the crowd of world leaders and bankers at Davos.",
      "But Trump's hostile words, and the threat of tariffs against his allies, have convinced leaders that the old world is gone.",
      "\u201cThe shift in the international order is not only seismic \u2014 but it is permanent, and the sheer speed of change far outstrips anything we have seen in decades,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said hours before Trump addressed world leaders.",
      "\u201cWe now live in a world defined by raw power \u2014 whether economic or military, technological or geopolitical,\u201d she told lawmakers Wednesday in Strasbourg, France. \"And while many of us may not like it, we must deal with the world as it is now.\u201d",
      "The unlikely epicenter of this geopolitical rupture is Greenland, the semi-autonomous Danish island that Trump is pursuing so aggressively he has threatened tariffs and even military action against his own NATO allies.",
      "If the postwar \u201crules-based international order\u201d was already fracturing, many now see this U.S.-led world rapidly unraveling with every leaked text exchange and artificial intelligence-generated territorial claim."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said  he won\u2019t use military force to acquire Greenland, but sent an unmistakable warning that Europe needs to cede it to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is dropping his threat to slap new tariffs on European nations in a fresh sign that he is prepared to reach a peaceful settlement to a tense standoff over the future of Greenland.",
      "Trump announced on social media that after a private meeting with NATO's secretary general in Davos, Switzerland, he agreed to the \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region.\"",
      "Trump gave no details, nor did he say he was abandoning his effort to wrest control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Earlier Wednesday, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.",
      "Senior administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, will lead the negotiations over Greenland's fate and report back to him, Trump wrote.",
      "Financial markets spiked at the news that Trump was ditching the 10% tariffs he said he would impose on eight European countries \u2014 part of a pressure campaign to gain possession of Greenland.",
      "For now, Trump seems intent on a negotiated resolution to the Greenland dispute. In his speech, he said he won\u2019t use military force to acquire Greenland, though he left no doubt that he still wants the U.S. to play a dominant role in Greenland's future.",
      "\u201cYou can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember,\" the president told the audience of CEOs, politicians and diplomats.",
      "He said that \"we want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won\u2019t give it. We\u2019ve never asked for anything else.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appearance at the conference comes amid the biggest crisis within the NATO alliance in decades. Longtime Western allies have cautioned that the rules-based international order is fraying as America threatens the sovereignty of smaller nations. The day before at Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country Trump has also targeted, said that the geopolitical landscape is undergoing not a \u201ctransition,\u201d but a \u201crupture.\u201d",
      "Trump made no apologies for his aggressive push to absorb Greenland, saying the U.S. needs the territory for the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system and to deprive adversaries of a foothold in America\u2019s own hemisphere.",
      "Though the U.S. already has a military base on Greenland \u2014 and European allies said they\u2019re open to an expanded American presence \u2014 Trump said that owning the island would provide more incentive for America to properly defend it. A lease agreement won\u2019t suffice, said Trump, a former real estate magnate.",
      "Trump told the audience that \u201cpsychologically, who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or a lease, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean, where if there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles will be flying right over the center of that piece of ice.\u201d",
      "European leaders have sounded baffled and resentful over Trump's efforts to procure Greenland.",
      "\u201cI do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Trump in a private text message the U.S. president posted online this week.",
      "In his speech, Trump laid out his rationale. NATO countries are obliged to defend themselves, and the U.S. is the only allied nation with the strength and resources to protect Greenland from hostile incursions, he said.",
      "\"It's the United States alone that can protect this giant mass of land, this giant piece of ice, develop it and improve it and make it so that it's good for Europe and safe for Europe and good for us,\" Trump said.",
      "He pointed to history. During World War II, Germany overran Denmark, which proved unable to defend itself or Greenland, he said. U.S. forces stepped in and kept the territory out of Hitler's hands. Now, America wants Greenland back. Denmark's defiance ignores the sacrifices American soldiers made, he suggested.",
      "\"Without us, right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps. After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now?\" Trump said.",
      "The audience listened largely in silence, according to a press pool report. There was some light laughter in the room, along with \u201cuncomfortable looks\u201d on the part of some of the attendees.",
      "Upon the president's arrival in Davos after an overnight flight from Washington, someone had written, \u201cTrump Go Home\u201d in the snow near his landing site.",
      "Speaking for more than an hour, Trump at times sounded as if he were delivering a boilerplate campaign address to a home audience. He touted his work over the past year, mentioning that gas prices have dropped and many government \u201cbureaucrats\u201d have been fired, suggesting they're now working in jobs that pay better in the private sector.",
      "He took a swipe at his predecessor, calling him \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d and said that people would be prosecuted over the 2020 election that made Biden president. Trump contends the election was \u201crigged,\u201d though there is no evidence of wrongdoing on a scale that would have reversed the outcome.",
      "Before he was finished, he bashed windmills, boasted of his \u201clandslide\u201d election victory in 2024 and denigrated the nation of Somalia, as well as the Somali-born congresswoman from Minnesota, Democrat Ilhan Omar. On at least four occasions, he confused Greenland with Iceland.",
      "Some of his most pointed comments were directed at traditional American allies. He questioned whether NATO would come to America\u2019s aid in the event of a war.",
      "\u201cThe problem with NATO is, we\u2019ll be there for them 100%, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be there for us,\u201d he said.",
      "(After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, NATO invoked Article V for the first time in its history \u2014 a clause stating that the attack on one member was an attack on all.)",
      "During a photo spray before his meeting with Trump, the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, sought to dispel Trump's concern that the alliance would abandon the U.S. in wartime.",
      "\u201cYou can be assured, absolutely, if ever U.S. will be under attack, your allies will be with you. Absolutely, there\u2019s absolute guarantee,\u201d Rutte told Trump. \u201cI really want to tell you this because this is important. It pains me if you think it is not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope that that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In his speech earlier in the day, Trump also had harsh words for Canada. He said that Canada  \u201cgets a lot of freebies from us,\u201d but is not \u201cgrateful.\u201d",
      "\u201cI watched your prime minister yesterday,\u201d Trump said, in reference to Carney. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so grateful.\u201d",
      "Before Trump spoke, NBC News interviewed one of his favorite foils: California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who is attending the conference. Trump name-checked Newsom during his speech, calling him a \"good guy\" who \"I used to get along so great with.\"",
      "Newsom, a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said of Trump\u2019s tenure: \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary wrecking ball presidency and administration. And people understand it here. There\u2019s a deep understanding in the United States, the impacts are going to be outsized, the next five, 10, 15 years.\u201d"

      "There was a chill in the air in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, thousands of miles away from the World Economic Forum taking place in the Swiss city of Davos. There, Trump used a major speech before world leaders Wednesday to up the pressure on Denmark and Europe to hand over what he called a \"piece of ice,\" though he appeared to rule out using military force to do so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Totally crazy,\u201d Peter Jensen, an office supply store's owner in Nuuk, said Tuesday, before Trump's speech. \u201cBut many are scared.\u201d",
      "Tillie Martinussen, a former member of Greenland\u2019s parliament, was incensed by Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a block of ice,\u201d she said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe are human beings. We have elderly people here who are so afraid right now. We have children that are afraid of the United States.\u201d",
      "She said that some Greenlanders had been so panicked by Trump that were gathering emergency supplies, with hunters \"taking out their rifles\" and getting them ready to defend against any would-be invaders.",
      "No matter what happens, people who had seen the United States as a friend will now think of it as a possible invader that \"can never be trusted again,\" Martinussen said."
