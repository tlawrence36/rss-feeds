      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Corinne Bailey Rae is working on a children's picture book that draws upon her early memories of music.",
      "The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter has a deal with Rocky Pond Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers, for \u201cPut Your Records On.\u201d Named for her signature hit and illustrated by Gillian Eilidh O\u2019Mara, the book is scheduled to come out March 3, 2026, and tells the story of a young girl's initiation into her great aunt's record collection.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a child, music helped me find myself. Through songs I discovered that others felt what I felt,\" Rae said in a statement released Wednesday. \"Playing music grew my confidence and writing and performing my own music allowed me to fully express myself. I want every child to know that they have music in their heart and a voice that should be heard.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is taking his seat in the president's box for opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at the Kennedy Center",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said.

      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",

      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened.

      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",

      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland.

      "Oscar-nominated \u201cPast Lives\u201d filmmaker Celine Song's new film \u201cMaterialists\u201d was inspired by the brief time she worked as a matchmaker in New York",
      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",

But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs.

    "story": [
      "Harm reductions initiatives are becoming more commonplace at major music festivals, both through partnerships with festival organizers as well as volunteer efforts done without explicit permission",
      "NEW YORK -- The sounds of muffled percussion and audience cheers reverberate throughout the grounds. Brand activations, makeshift bars and restaurant pop-ups control traffic as a sea of bodies move from set to set. Sandwiched between is a row of nonprofits across familiar causes: hunger, housing and voter registration.",
      "It's a common music festival scene, until closer inspection. There is a new table, This Must Be the Place. The Ohio-based nonprofit offers attendees free opioid overdose reversal treatment and training on how to use it, an education acquired in under two minutes. Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",
      "\u201cI was as shocked as ever last month when I answered the phone and heard Ms. Winfrey\u2019s voice again, twenty-seven years after the last time we had talked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me my latest novel, \u2018The River Is Waiting,\u2019 would be the 115th title in her beloved Book Club.

      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be focusing on one of his three accusers as they deliberate for a fourth day",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter",
      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "Cole Escola of \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "The night delivered a stirring mix of purpose and entertainment from Doechii 's powerful speech, Jamie Foxx 's emotional reflection and Kevin Hart 's sharp comedic opener.",
      "Doechii made her presence felt early during the five-hour ceremony, using her acceptance speech for best female hip-hop artist to draw attention to the immigration raids and protest crackdowns taking place just miles from the venue. Her message added urgency and depth to a ceremony meant to honor both Black excellence and social impact.",
      "After being named best female hip-hop artist \u2014 her first-ever BET Award \u2014 Doechii acknowledged her fellow nominees, then shifted the spotlight to the issues unfolding outside the venue.",
      "\u201cThere are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,\u201d said Doechii, who won a Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category.",
      "\u201cTrump is using military forces to stop a protest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. What type of government is that?\u201d",
      "Doechii\u2019s words drew applause from the audience at the Peacock Theater, where the awards aired live.",
      "\u201cPeople are being swept up and torn from their families,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people. \u2026 We all deserve to live in hope and not fear. I hope we stand together.\u201d",
      "Foxx, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg and Kirk Franklin received the Ultimate Icon Award. They were selected due to their impact on entertainment as well as their community impact and advocacy.",
      "Foxx was the first to receive his award. He was visibly moved during a heartfelt moment at the awards, being brought to tears while accepting his trophy after surviving a life-threatening health scare in recent years.",
      "The Oscar and Grammy winner reflected on watching the in memoriam tribute from his seat.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the memoriam, I was like, \u2018Man, that could\u2019ve been me,\u2019\u201d said Foxx, who was hospitalized in 2023 after suffering a stroke. In an interview with The Associated Press, he recalled the severity of the moment: \u201cThe thing was almost a wrap. Every prayer counted.\u201d",
      "Foxx was presented the award by music legend Stevie Wonder, adding even more weight to the emotional moment. As he stood on stage, his voice cracked with gratitude.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why I went through what I went through. But I know my second chance \u2014 I won\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Foxx said, as his two daughters and sister wiped away tears from the audience. \u201cI have so much love to give. Just give me one more crack at this. Whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I\u2019ll do right. \u2026 You can\u2019t go through something like that and not testify.\u201d",
      "Carey said this was her first time collecting a trophy at the BET Awards. The singer said she became emotional after Busta Rhymes introduced her.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while, but I finally realized that life is far too short to live for anyone else's approval, which is something I always did,\u201d said Carey, a five-time Grammy winner. \u201cI decided to own who I am.\u201d",
      "Dr. Dre presented the award to Snoop, who walked onstage with his wife Shante Taylor. In his speech, he paid homage to Carey, Franklin and Foxx before thanking the many others who helped him throughout his life.",
      "\u201cHip-hop gave me a voice. It gave me a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a way out and a way into homes, hearts, cultures and countries I'd never thought I would even touch. Being an icon isn't about fame. It's about legacy. It's about what you build, what you leave behind and who you lift up along the way.\u201d",
      "Franklin expressed gratitude for the honor, admitting he\u2019s far from the perfect Christian, husband, father or artist. He joked, \u201cI can\u2019t even sing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhich makes this award so amazing, because what I do really don\u2019t make sense,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re listening to this, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s God.\u201d",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t come up here poppin\u2019,\u201d Hart added, as cameras caught Franklin bowing his head and chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t try to blame it on the Lord. The Lord didn\u2019t ask for that. Put it away, Kirk.\u201d",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "The panel of seven women and five men on Thursday began weighing two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the former movie mogul. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion.

      "In a post on social media, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d praised the deal as \u201ca truly historic milestone: an EU-UK political agreement on the future relationship concerning Gibraltar. This benefits everyone and reinforces a new chapter in the relationship.\u201d",
      "Britain left the European Union in 2020 with the relationship between Gibraltar and the bloc unresolved. Talks on a deal to ensure people and goods can keep flowing over the Gibraltar-Spain border previously had made only halting progress.",

      "The deal would involve removing all physical barriers, checks and controls on people and goods circulating between Spain and Gibraltar, the EU said in a statement. At the same time, it would respect Europe\u2019s free travel zone rules and the EU single market.",
      "The statement said the pact \u201cwill bring confidence and legal certainty to the lives and well-being of the people of the whole region by promoting shared prosperity and close and constructive relations between the Gibraltar and Spanish authorities.\u201d",
      "The U.K. said that half Gibraltar\u2019s population crosses the border each day and that without an agreement, new EU entry-exit rules mean every one would have to have their passports checked.",

      "Courts in Russia on Friday convicted one opposition figure in absentia and placed another under house arrest as Moscow continues its crackdown on dissent.",
      "Leonid Volkov, a close associate of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was sentenced in absentia to 18 years in prison after being found guilty on criminal charges.",
      "Moscow\u2019s Second Western District Military convicted Volkov under 40 counts including justifying terrorism, organizing and financing an extremist group, rehabilitating Nazism, and creating a non-governmental organization that violated citizens\u2019 rights, Russian news agencies reported.",

      "\u201cOh no! They banned me from the internet for 10 years as prosecutors requested, but I've already been using it\u201d, Volkov wrote in a tongue-in-cheek social media post after the sentence was released. \u201cDamn. Whatever am I going to do?\"",
      "Volkov, who was in charge of Navalny\u2019s regional offices and election campaigns, left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities. He led Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation between 2021 and 2023, during which time he was placed on the Russian government\u2019s list of terrorists and extremists.

      "Russian authorities have accused Shlosberg of discrediting the nation\u2019s military by calling for a ceasefire in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. Shlosberg has said that he did not share the social media video or administer the page on which it was posted. If found guilty, he faces up to five years imprisonment.",
      "The politician, who has repeatedly criticized Moscow\u2019s war, was previously named as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d by Russian authorities, a loaded term that carries connotations of Soviet-era treachery.",
      "Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has clamped down on all forms of dissent, targeting rights groups, independent media and other members of civil-society organizations, LGBTQ+ activists and certain religious affiliations.",

    "story": [
      "Japan this week confirmed that two Chinese aircraft carriers have operated together for the first time in the Pacific",
      "TOKYO -- Japan this week confirmed that two Chinese aircraft carriers have operated together for the first time in the Pacific, fueling Tokyo's concern about Beijing's rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders.",
      "Aircraft carriers are critical to projecting power at a distance. China routinely sends coast guard vessels, warships and warplanes to areas around the disputed East China Sea islands, but now it is going as far as what's called the second-island chain that includes Guam \u2014 a U.S. territory. A single Chinese carrier has ventured into the Pacific in the past, but never east of that chain until now.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest moves by China, which has the world\u2019s largest navy numerically.",
      "Japan's Defense Ministry said the two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, were seen separately but almost simultaneously operating near southern islands in the Pacific for the first time. Both operated in waters off Iwo Jima, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Tokyo, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Monday.",
      "The Liaoning also sailed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone of Minamitorishima, the country's easternmost island. There was no violation of Japanese territorial waters. Still, Nakatani said Japan has expressed \u201cconcern\u201d to the Chinese embassy.",
      "Both carriers had warplanes take off and land. Late Wednesday, Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said a Chinese J-15 fighter jet that took off from the Shandong on Saturday chased a Japanese P-3C aircraft on reconnaissance duty in the area and came within an \u201cabnormally close distance\u201d of 45 meters (50 yards).",
      "The Chinese jet on Sunday crossed 900 meters (980 yards) in front of the Japanese P-3C, the ministry said, adding it has strongly requested China to take measures to prevent such an \u201cabnormal approach\u201d that could cause accidental collisions.",
      "China's military buildup and expanding area of activity have raised tensions in the region.",
      "The Chinese carriers sailed past the first-island chain, the Pacific archipelago off the Asian mainland that includes Japan, Taiwan and part of the Philippines. The Liaoning reached farther to the second-island chain, a strategic line extending to Guam, showing China also can challenge Japan's ally, the United States.",
      "\u201cChina apparently aims to elevate its capability of the two aircraft carriers, and to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace,\" Nakatani said.",
      "The defense minister vowed to further strengthen Japan's air defense on remote islands.",
      "Japan has been accelerating its military buildup especially since 2022, including counter-strike capability, with long-range cruise missiles as deterrence to China.",
      "China's navy on Tuesday confirmed the deployments, calling it part of routine training in the western Pacific \u201cto test their capabilities in far seas protection and joint operations.\" It said the deployment was in compliance with international laws and not targeted at any country.",
      "China is pursuing a vast military modernization program including ambitions of a true \u201cblue-water\u201d naval force capable of operating at long ranges for extended periods.",
      "Beijing has the world\u2019s largest navy numerically but lags far behind the United States in its number of aircraft carriers. China has three, the U.S. 11.",
      "Washington\u2019s numerical advantage allows it to keep a carrier, currently the USS George Washington, permanently forward-deployed to Japan.",
      "The Pentagon has expressed concern over Beijing\u2019s focus on building new carriers. Its latest report to Congress on Chinese defense developments noted that it \"extends air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore.\u201d",
      "The two Chinese carriers currently in the western Pacific employ the older \u201cski-jump\u201d launch method for aircraft, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to assist planes taking off. China\u2019s first carrier, the Liaoning, was a repurposed Soviet ship. The second, the Shandong, was built in China along the Soviet design.",
      "Its third carrier, the Fujian, launched in 2022 and is undergoing final sea trials. It is expected to be operational later this year. It is locally designed and built and employs a more modern, electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S.",
      "All three ships are conventionally powered, while all the U.S. carriers are nuclear powered, giving them the ability to operate at much greater range and more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Satellite imagery provided to The Associated Press last year indicated China is working on a nuclear propulsion system for its carriers.",
      "In August, a Chinese reconnaissance aircraft violated Japan's airspace off the southern prefecture of Nagasaki, and a Chinese survey ship violated Japanese territorial waters off another southern prefecture, Kagoshima. In September, the Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Japan\u2019s westernmost island of Yonaguni \u2014 just east of Taiwan \u2014 and nearby Iriomote, entering an area just outside Japan\u2019s territorial waters where the country has some control over maritime traffic.",
      "China routinely sends coast guard vessels and aircraft into waters and airspace surrounding the Japanese-controlled, disputed East China Sea islands to harass Japanese vessels in the area, forcing Japan to scramble jets.",
      "Tokyo also worries about China's increased joint military activities with Russia, including joint operations of warplanes or warships around northern and southwestern Japan in recent years.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran on Wednesday executed a man convicted in the fatal shootings of seven people during a 2022 protest over the death of Mahsa Amini, though human rights activists say he was tortured into confessing to killings likely carried out by security services.",
      "The hanging of Abbas Kourkouri, also known as Mojahed Kourkouri, marks the first execution in nearly a year for someone arrested in the protests surrounding the death of Amini, who had been detained by police allegedly over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to their liking. Her death sparked months of demonstrations. Even today, some women refuse to wear their headscarves in public, openly defying a hijab law instituted by the country\u2019s theocracy.",
      "It's unclear why authorities chose now to execute Kourkouri, 42, though tensions have been rising regionally over Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, and the result of talks with the United States remains uncertain. Iran is one of the world's top executioners and has been cracking down in other ways on society in the time since the Amini demonstrations.",
      "Kourkouri \u201cwas sentenced to death without a fair trial and without access to a lawyer of his choice,\u201d said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam of the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights, which tallied an average of one execution in the Islamic Republic every six hours over the last eight months.",
      "Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported at the time that on Nov. 16, 2022 two gunmen on motorcycles shot at protesters and security personnel gathered at the central market in the southwestern city of Izeh in the country's restive, oil-rich Khuzestan province.",
      "The assault killed seven people, including a 9-year-old boy, and wounded three police officers and two members of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The death of the boy, named Kian Pirfalak, drew anger from Iranians, particularly after his family reportedly said it was security forces \u2014 not other gunmen \u2014 who opened fire.",
      "Kourkouri was accused of being one of the gunmen.",
      "He was charged with a spate of offenses, including \u201cmoharebeh\u201d \u2013 an Islamic term meaning waging a battle against God. Authorities arrested him in December 2022 after reportedly shooting him in the leg. Activists say he was denied medical treatment beyond the bullet's removal.",
      "State media described Kourkouri as a drug dealer and \u201cinstigator\u201d with a history of extremist beliefs. But rights advocates say he isn\u2019t the violent person authorities have made him out to be and was himself an innocent protester.",
      "\u201cHe was arrested during the \u2018Woman, Life, Freedom\u2019 protests, and the Islamic Republic authorities attempted to blame him\" for the attack, Amiry-Moghaddam said. He added that the slain boy\u2019s parents and uncle believed Iranian security forces were responsible.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which also monitors Iran, similarly dismissed the Iranian government's claims.",
      "\u201cWhile authorities continue to describe the events of Nov. 16 in Izeh as a \u2018terrorist attack,\u2019 eyewitnesses and the families of victims have presented accounts that contradict the government\u2019s narrative,\u201d it said Wednesday. The group quoted Kian\u2019s mother as saying, \u201cOn our way home, officers opened fire on our car.\u201d",
      "State media earlier broadcast videos of Kourkouri taking blame for the attack. But Amnesty International has said that authorities subjected him to solitary confinement and coerced his confessions, and that he wasn't at the scene at the time of the killings.",
      "One videotaped confession that had been aired on state TV showed Kourkouri in bed with his arm visibly bandaged and bloody, the rights group said. The footage resembled that of many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast in Iran.",
      "Kourkouri's death brings the tally of executions related to violence at the Amini protests up to 11. The last such execution came 10 months ago, after Reza Resaei, 34, was sentenced to death over the killing of a security officer. Rights groups also said his confession was forced.",
      "The United Nations-established Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran said Wednesday that proceedings against Kourkouri had been \u201cmarred by gross human rights violations.\u201d It called on Iran to halt executions, including those against women's rights activists.",
      "On the streets of Iranian cities, it\u2019s becoming increasingly common to see a woman pass by without a mandatory hijab, as the third anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches this fall.",
      "The government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars, and authorities have gone as far as to use aerial drones to monitor women.",
      "The country\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to curb the morality police's harassment of women. But the country\u2019s ultimate authority rests with its 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",

      "Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish airbases in the Scandinavian country.",
      "The new parameters follow Trump's coveting of the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island even as the U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies.",
      "The legislation now goes to Danish King Frederik X for his signature. Ninety-four lawmakers voted for it, while 11 voted against.",

      "Taiwan\u2019s worst modern quake, a 1999 magnitude 7.7 temblor that killed 2,415 people, damaged buildings and led to tightened building codes, better response times and coordination and widespread public education campaigns on earthquake safety. Schools and workplaces hold earthquake drills, while cellphones buzz whenever a strong earthquake is detected.",
      "Earthquake damage since then has been significantly reduced.",

      "Police in Northern Ireland say 17 officers were injured during a second night of anti-immigrant violence in the town of Ballymena",
      "LONDON -- Police in Northern Ireland say 17 officers were injured during a second night of anti-immigrant violence in the town of Ballymena, where rioters threw bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and fireworks and set several vehicles and houses on fire.",
      "Police used water cannon and fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of several hundred people. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday that the violence died down by about 1 a.m. (0000GMT). Five people were arrested on suspicion of \u201criotous behavior.\u201d",
      "Violence erupted Monday after a peaceful march to show support for the family of the victim of an alleged sexual assault on the weekend. Two 14-year-old boys have been charged.",
      "The suspects have not been identified because of their age. They were supported in court by a Romanian interpreter.",
      "After the march, a crowd of mostly young people set several houses on fire and pelted police with projectiles. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said 15 officers were injured that night.",
      "There were similar scenes after dark on Tuesday, as well as small pockets of disorder in several other Northern Ireland towns.",
      "Police said agitators on social media were helping fuel what Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson called \u201cracist thuggery.\u201d",
      "Some politicians said immigration had strained the town of about 30,000 some 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Belfast, long known as a bastion of hardline pro-British Loyalism.",
      "Jim Allister, leader of the conservative party Traditional Unionist Voice, said \u201cunchecked migration, which is beyond what the town can cope with, is a source of past and future tensions.\u201d",
      "Some Romanians in Ballymena told Britain\u2019s PA news agency they had lived in the town for years and were shocked by the violence.",
      "Several houses in the Clonavon Terrace area that was the focus of the violence put up signs identifying their residents as British or Filipino in an apparent attempt to avoid being targeted.",
      "Henderson said there was no evidence that Loyalist paramilitaries, who still hold sway over Protestant communities, were behind the disorder.",
      "Northern Ireland has a long history of street disorder stretching back to tensions between the British unionist and Irish nationalist communities.",
      "Though three decades of violence known as \u201cthe Troubles\u201d largely ended after a 1998 peace accord, tensions remain between those \u2014 largely Protestants \u2014 who see themselves as British and Irish nationalists, who are mostly Catholic. In Belfast, \u201cpeace walls\u201d still separate working-class Protestant and Catholic areas.",
      "Street rioters sporadically clash with police, and recently immigrants have become a target.",
      "Anti-immigrant violence erupted in Northern Ireland as well as England last year after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the northwest England town of Southport. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a migrant played a part.",
      "Police condemned the latest violence and said they would call in officers from England and Wales to bolster their response if needed.",
      "All the parties in Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government issued a joint statement appealing for calm and urging people to reject \u201cthe divisive agenda being pursued by a minority of destructive, bad faith actors.\"",
      "On the alleged sexual assault, the statement added that \u201cit is paramount that the justice process is now allowed to take its course so that this heinous crime can be robustly investigated. Those weaponizing the situation in order to sow racial tensions do not care about seeing justice and have nothing to offer their communities but division and disorder.\u201d",

      "The Vatican expressed satisfaction that Leo\u2019s June 5 nomination of Bishop Joseph Lin Yuntuan as auxiliary bishop of Fuzhou was recognized Wednesday by Chinese authorities.",
      "The Vatican said in a statement that Lin taking possession of the diocese and the civic recognition of his appointment \u201cconstitutes a further fruit of the dialogue between the Holy See and the Chinese authorities and is a significant step in the diocese\u2019s communal journey.\u201d",
      "Francis had riled conservatives when he approved a deal in 2018 over bishop nominations, which had been the most divisive issue in Vatican-China relations since diplomatic ties were severed when the Communists came to power. China had insisted on an exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican asserted the pope\u2019s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",
      "China's estimated 12 million Catholics have been divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn\u2019t recognize papal authority and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution. The Vatican tried for decades to unify the flock and the 2018 deal was aimed at healing that division, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren\u2019t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.",
      "The details of the 2018 deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.",
      "The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing\u2019s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and has been renewed periodically since then.",
      "One of the big foreign policy questions facing Leo, history's first American pope, was whether he would continue renewing the accord or heed conservative demands and make some changes.",
      "There have been apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.",

      "LONDON -- Britain's Labour government hopes to regain the political initiative Wednesday when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years, with big increases expected for health, defense and housing.",
      "Reeves, who has been blamed by many for Labour's decline in popularity since it returned to power after 14 years in July, will outline the government's spending and investment priorities for lawmakers. There will be no tax announcements.",
      "Reeves is expected to argue the government is on the path to \u201crenewing Britain\u201d but that \u201ctoo many people in too many parts of the country are yet to feel it,\u201d according to remarks issued by the Treasury.",

      "Labour won a landslide victory last year on a slogan of \u201cchange\u201d and voter anger at the Conservative administration in power at the time, but its vote share was historically low for a winning party at 35%.",
      "In the months since, Labour has been overtaken in opinion polls by the anti-immigration and recently formed Reform UK. Reeves has been blamed by many for Labour's struggles, not least her decision in July to withdraw a winter fuel subsidy to all but the poorest retirees.",
      "The outcry, which contributed to Labour's poor performance in recent local elections, prompted Reeves to about-turn and raise the threshold at which retirees will get the subsidy.",
      "She and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will hope the change will stem the anger and focus voters on other issues, such as its spending priorities.",
      "Among the main announcements is expected to be a 30 billion-pound ($41 billion) increase in funding for Britain's cherished but struggling National Health Service, as well as a rise in defense spending that will account for 2.5% of national output by 2027. Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the move, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, was part of efforts \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "Kang Yu-jung, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, described the decision as a \u201cproactive step\u201d to reduce military tensions and ease the burden for South Koreans residing in border areas, who have also been affected by North Korea\u2019s retaliatory loudspeaker broadcasts.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "South Korea reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North last year in response to thousands of trash balloons that Pyongyang flew toward South Korea to drop substances including wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate occasions, according to the South's military. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "The South's broadcast playlist was clearly designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim\u2019s government has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "Lee, an outspoken liberal who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During his election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds. On Thursday morning, South Korea's military said North Korean broadcasts weren't heard in South Korean frontline areas, but it wasn't clear if the North has formally halted its own broadcasts.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim. North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine. South Korean and U.S. officials have expressed concern that Kim in return could seek Russian technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by his nuclear weapons and missile program.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean nuclear attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim declared in January 2024 that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",
      "Following years of heightened testing activity, Kim has acquired a broad range of missiles that could potentially target rivals in Asia and the U.S. mainland. He has also called for increased production of nuclear materials to create more bombs.",

The first candles were laid on Tuesday evening as a crowd gathered on the square, some people hugging each other as they tried to come to terms with the tragedy. Hundreds of people joined Austrian officials at a service Tuesday evening in the Graz cathedral.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Donald Tusk defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament on Wednesday, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat.",
      "Tusk requested a vote of confidence in the wake of the June 1 loss of Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski \u2014 his close ally \u2014 to nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, Nawrocki is set to replace outgoing President Andrzej Duda, another conservative who repeatedly blocked Tusk\u2019s reform efforts.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a vote of confidence with full conviction that we have a mandate to govern, to take full responsibility for what is happening in Poland,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "Most of the power in Poland's parliamentary system rests with an elected parliament and a government chosen by the parliament. However, the president can veto legislation and represents the country abroad.",
      "\u201cAnyone who is ready to move forward with me, with the government, and above all with our voters, regardless of these momentary emotions, and build a better Poland, should vote today for a vote of confidence in our government,\" Tusk said.",
      "The vote, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, is widely expected to go in Tusk\u2019s favor. His four-party coalition holds a narrow but stable majority in the 460-seat Sejm, Poland\u2019s lower house.",
      "A loss would trigger the formation of a caretaker government and may open the door for an early parliamentary election. That could potentially returning power to the conservative Law and Justice party, in coalition with the far-right Confederation party, whose candidate placed third in the presidential race.",
      "Tusk had long counted on a Trzaskowski victory to break the institutional deadlock created by Duda\u2019s vetoes. Instead, he now faces an incoming president aligned with the nationalist opposition and openly hostile to his government\u2019s legislative priorities.",
      "\u201cWe cannot close our eyes to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cA president who was reluctant to accept the changes we proposed for Poland and our voters is being replaced by a president who is at least equally reluctant to those changes and proposals.\u201d",
      "But he also argued that Trzaskowski\u2019s narrow defeat indicates that there is continued strong support for those who share his views.",
      "The election result has rattled the already uneasy governing coalition, which spans from center-left to center-right and has struggled to deliver on key campaign pledges, including liberalizing Poland\u2019s abortion law and legalizing same-sex civil unions. Tusk acknowledged the growing strains in Wednesday\u2019s address.",
      "Many are also blaming Tusk for contributing to Trzaskowski\u2019s loss. Much of the criticism has come from within his coalition, as his partners examine whether they are better off sticking with him or risking a collapse of the coalition. Some are calling for a new prime minister to be selected.",
      "There are questions about what Tusk can realistically achieve before the next parliamentary election, scheduled for late 2027, and whether the coalition will even survive that long amid a surge in popularity for the far right. Polish media and political analysts are debating whether this might be the 68-year-old Tusk's political twilight.",
      "\u201cI know the taste of victory, I know the bitterness of defeat, but I don\u2019t know the word surrender,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "As part of his fresh start, he announced plans for a government reconstruction in July that will include \u201cnew faces.\u201d He said a government spokesman would be appointed in June \u2014 an acknowledgement that the coalition needs a way to present a unified message. So far Tusk has sought to communicate his policies to the public himself on social media and in news conferences.",
      "Tusk served as Polish prime minister from 2007 to 2014 and then as president of the European Council from 2014 to 2019. He became Poland's prime minister again in December 2023 in a country exhausted by the pandemic and inflation, and with political divisions deep and bitter.",
      "In a sign of those divisions, half of the parliament hall was empty on Wednesday, with lawmakers from the right-wing Law and Justice party boycotting his speech. Tusk said their absence showed disrespect to the nation.",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",
      "\u201cMineral mining and processing in (Xinjiang) rely in part on the state\u2019s forced labor programs for Uyghurs and other Turkic people in the region,\u201d the report said.",
      "The named companies did not immediately comment on the report.",
      "A 2022 United Nations report found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as part of measures the Chinese government said were intended to target terrorism and separatism.",
      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "E-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.",
      "Some of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.",
      "Rohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.",
      "But that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.",
      "The Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.",
      "The raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.",
      "The Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d",
      "That fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.",
      "\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "An aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.",
      "The raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d",
      "Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.",
      "\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety during a hearing Wednesday in the wake of January's deadly midair collision and a string of other crashes and near misses since then.",
      "Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford\u2019s nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.",
      "Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA\u2019s top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump\u2019s multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.",
      "Even the air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.",
      "\u201cFlying is safe, but as you know the system that manages our skies is showing its age,\" Bedford said in his prepared statement to the committee. \u201cThe stresses of this antiquated system truly came into view as we all returned to the skies after COVID.\u201d",
      "Pilots\u2019 unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to want to know ... whether you\u2019re going to lead any effort to change that rule,\u201d Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell said. She asked for a firm written answer because \u201cyou helped fund and lobbied for a change for it.\u201d",
      "Bedford acknowledged Wednesday that \u201cproblems persist and more work needs to be done\u201d to ensure the safety of flying around the nation's capital. He said his own airline's planes have received at least three alarms about conflicting traffic around Reagan since January.",

These hidden gems boast a special combination of attractive qualities and can potentially make excellent choices for savvy folks who want their ride to stand out from the sea of mainstream vehicles. Certain slower-selling cars don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, whether due to styling, the type of vehicle, or brand image. Edmunds explores five hidden gems and the wow factor that makes them shine. Our choices are ordered by starting price, including destination fees.",
      "The Ioniq 6 is an electric sedan that does almost everything right. It\u2019s sporty and fun to drive, yet it\u2019s also comfortable and has a smooth ride over rough dips and potholes. Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",

      "The Ridgeline could be an ideal truck for you depending on your priorities. If you plan on frequently towing heavy loads and tackling serious off-road trails, then other midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger would be a better fit. But if not, you should consider the Ridgeline. It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler. It also has clever features like a lockable in-bed trunk and a tailgate that folds down or swings to the side. Its bed is large enough for 4-foot-wide plywood sheets without resting them on the wheelwells.",

      "Mitsubishi doesn\u2019t sell as many vehicles as giant brands like Chevrolet or Toyota. But the Outlander PHEV is surprisingly capable and versatile. It\u2019s a plug-in hybrid SUV that offers three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive. If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids. Its starting price isn\u2019t low because it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid, but the Mitsubishi comes well equipped, and the top SEL trim level is quite luxurious.",
      "2025 Outlander PHEV starting price: $42,040",
      "The Crown is a relatively new Toyota that turns heads with its distinctive design. Its styling is similar to a sedan\u2019s, but the Crown has a raised ride height that\u2019s more like a crossover SUV\u2019s. Oh, and it\u2019s a hybrid too. The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",
      "Inside, the Crown has a pleasing interior with large display screens, spacious seating and a comfortable ride. But all this comes at a cost. The Crown is pricey for a non-luxury hybrid sedan, especially the top Platinum trim that has the Hybrid Max engine.",
      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival. The most notable ones include front and rear massaging seats, a 26-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, a massive package of advanced driver aids, and an air suspension that scans the road ahead so it can adjust to road imperfections.",

      "But with concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, the group is readying to possibly help in ways it hasn\u2019t before.",
      "\u201cThe one thing certain this hurricane season is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen at the federal level,\u201d said Jeff Byard, Team Rubicon senior vice president of operations.",
      "Byard and his team are evaluating how else they can help communities if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees federal response to disasters, reduces its capacity or is deployed less often. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to overhaul FEMA, if not totally dismantle it.",
      "Team Rubicon is good at being agile, Byard said, but nonprofits and funders are already under pressure from more frequent and severe climate events. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder in a really hard situation already,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts worry Trump might approve fewer major disaster declarations, which unlock federal funding and resources, and that FEMA\u2019s response could be slowed or diminished. Trainings have been reduced, and around 2,000 employees have left or been fired since January, including high-level staff.",
      "\"Whether it's a hurricane or earthquake, the federal government is not prepared the way it has been in the past,\u201d said Michael Coen, who held posts at FEMA under three presidential administrations.",
      "Nonprofits and funders across the United States say there is too much at stake for communities to just wait and see what happens. \u201cFrom the nonprofit perspective, we have to really lean in,\u201d said Marcus Coleman, vice president of community resilience strategy for United Way Worldwide.",
      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",
      "The new responsibilities could come at a time when states, nonprofits and funders are already under strain from worsening disasters and federal funding cuts across government.",
      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",
      "\u201cWhen you're working at a homeless shelter that is 100% utilized and then you drop a disaster on it, it\u2019s \u2018How will I continue to do my job,\u2019 not \u2018How can I expand my mission.\u2019\u201d",
      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda along the inter-Korean border",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim in January 2024 declared that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on Tuesday, finding that Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the U.S. African Development Foundation's board members in February. In March, the same judge ruled that the administration's removal of most grant money and staff from the congressionally created agency was also legal, as long as the agency was maintained at the minimum level required by law.",

In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. At the time, USADF had five of its seven board seats filled. A few days later, an administration official told Ward Brehm that he was fired, and emails were sent to the other board members notifying them that they had also been terminated.",

      "That lawsuit is still pending before the same judge. In that case, two USADF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF contend that the Trump administration's efforts to deeply scale back the agency wrongly usurps Congress' powers. They also say Marocco was unlawfully appointed to the board, in part because he was never confirmed by the Senate as required.",

      "U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase.",
      "The government's inflation report, to be released Wednesday, is forecast to show that consumer prices rose 2.5% in May compared with a year ago, according to economists surveyed by data provider FactSet. That would be the first increase in four months and up from 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices are projected to have risen 2.9% in May from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in April.",
      "Trump's tariffs are expected to contribute to the uptick by raising the cost of some imports, including clothes, furniture, appliances, and possibly new cars. Many retailers and some consumer products companies have said they have plans to raise prices or have already done so to cover the cost of the import duties.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have moved up 0.2% from April to May, while core prices are forecast to have increased 0.3%. At that pace, core prices would rise much faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists and the inflation-fighters at the Fed focus on core inflation because it often provides a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has cooled in the past year and, excluding the impact of tariffs, economists say it would be on track to return to the Fed's target, which would allow the central bank to cut its key interest rates. Yet core prices have been more stubborn and were stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year until February, when they started to decline a bit.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.",
      "Nearly all economists expect Trump's duties will make many things more expensive in the second half of this year, including cars and groceries, though by how much is still uncertain. Trump has slapped 30% tariffs on all imports from China, plus a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from every other country, and 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum.",
      "Given the potential for higher prices in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they will keep their key rate unchanged until they have a better sense of how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "The full impact of the tariffs likely won't be felt until the second half of the year, analysts say, even though many tariffs have been in place, in one form or another, since March and April. There are several reasons it can take months for the duties to fully pass through into retail prices.",
      "To begin with, many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, producing a flood of imports in March. As a result, they have stockpiled goods in warehouses that weren't hit by tariffs and so don't have to raise prices yet.",
      "Many companies also held off on hiking prices during the chaos of April and May, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, only to put them on hold a week later. He also ramped up duties on China to 145%, essentially cutting off trade with the United States' third-largest trading partner. Imports fell sharply in April as a result. The U.S. and China last month agreed to lower duties, with the U.S. now taxing Chinese imports 30%.",
      "For many firms, it wasn't worth it to raise prices until they had a better sense of where tariffs would settle. It's possible some duties could fall further if the Trump administration is able to reach trade deals in negotiations with China, the European Union, Japan and other countries.",
      "Still, Bryan Eshelman, a partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said higher prices \u201care coming.\u201d",
      "Eshelman expects that shoppers will start feeling the impact in July, and predicts prices for back-to-school items like clothing and backpacks could go up anywhere from 5% to 15%. Retailers may add surcharges tied to higher tariffs costs at the cash register starting in September, he said.",
      "\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that retailers are going to be loathe to pull out and do. And so I think they will wait to see how things unfold, \u201d he said.",
      "Most imported goods are actually parts or raw materials for larger products, such as the steel and aluminum goods now facing 50% duties. It will take time for those costs to filter through the supply chain and affect prices.",
      "Some stores, however, have already said they will implement higher prices, including Best Buy, Walmart and Lululemon.",
      "It was only last month when Trump ripped into Walmart after the nation\u2019s largest retailer boldly warned that prices are already starting to go up on items like bananas. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press that a car seat that currently sells for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100.",
      "Rainey also told analysts at an Oppenheimer investor conference on Monday that for some items, Walmart will reduce inventory by as much as 20% because it expects higher prices will reduce demand, and it doesn\u2019t want to be stuck with leftover inventory.",

      "President Donald Trump likes to say he\u2019s bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of extra profits to fund its war in Ukraine as part of a new raft of sanctions aimed at forcing Moscow to the negotiating table, senior officials said on Tuesday.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is \u201cproposing to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price, and lowering the oil price cap will hit Russia\u2019s revenues hard.\u201d",

      "All 27 EU member countries must all agree for the sanctions to enter force.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces while avoiding worsening inflation for everyday people and a currency collapse.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she assumed that the price cap would be discussed and agreed among the leaders of the Group of Seven major world economic powers when they meet in Canada on June 15-17.",
      "She said the United States and its G7 partners realize \u201cthat the oil price has lowered so much that the effectiveness of the cap is to be questioned, and therefore we all want to lower the oil price from $60 per barrel down to $45 per barrel.\u201d",
      "The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were sabotaged in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "The Commission has said that it wants to impose sanctions on the operating consortium to discourage investors from trying to use the pipelines in future.",
      "The blasts happened as Europe attempted to wean itself off Russian energy sources following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and contributed to tensions that followed the start of the war.",

      "An export ban worth some 2.5 billion euros would also be imposed, and the assets frozen of more than 20 Russian and foreign companies alleged to be providing support to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "Von der Leyen said the sanctions are aimed at forcing Russia into serious talks about peace with Ukraine. \u201cWe need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,\u201d she told reporters.",

      "The Indonesian government says they have suspended four nickel mining operations in one of the country\u2019s top tourist destinations for diving and snorkeling",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The Indonesian government announced Tuesday they had suspended four nickel mining operations in Raja Ampat, one of the country\u2019s top tourist destinations for diving and snorkeling.",
      "\u201cStarting today, the government has revoked four mining operation permits in Raja Ampat,\u201d Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia told reporters after a Cabinet meeting in the presidential palace in the capital, Jakarta.",
      "Raja Ampat, an archipelagic regency in Southwest Papua province, is spread over nearly 20,000 square kilometers (7,700 square miles) and is home to 75% of the world\u2019s coral species and more than 1,600 fish species. It is a designated UNESCO Global Geopark which includes marine conservation zones managed by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries.",
      "Lahadalia said the decision came after an investigation by the Ministry of Environment uncovered \u201cseveral violations in the environmental context\u201d by four companies holding mining permits in Raja Ampat.",
      "None of the four companies had started nickel operations as they failed to gain government approval for their Work Plan and Expenditure Budget, Lahadalia said.",
      "Last week, Greenpeace Indonesia and Papuan Youth staged a peaceful protest during the Indonesia Critical Minerals Conference & Expo. They demanded the closure of five nickel mining companies operating in Raja Ampat, including PT Gag Nikel, a subsidiary of state-owned mining company PT Aneka Tambang.",
      "The government suspended nickel mining operations at four of the five companies. The fifth, Gag Nikel, has been allowed to continue its operations on Gag Island as it lies outside the geopark area, Lahadalia said. Gag Island is about 42 kilometers (26 miles) west of Piyanemo, a popular diving spot in Raja Ampat.",
      "Gag Nikel has a concession area of \u200b\u200b130 square kilometers (50 square miles). It produced around 3 million wet metric tons of nickel in 2024, and is expected to produce the same amount in 2025 and 2026.",
      "Lahadalia said Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has instructed him, along with ministers for the environment and forestry, to closely monitor Gag Nikel's mining operation.",
      "\u201cWe are really serious in our intent to protect the environment in Raja Ampat,\" Lahadalia said. \u201cWe want to produce nickel that is environmentally friendly and acceptable (to the world\u2019s standard).\u201d",
      "Indonesia has the largest nickel reserves in the world and aims to dominate global nickel supply. Its nickel ore lies in shallow deposits, easily accessible when the rainforest is cut down.",
      "In 2023, the country was responsible for more than half the supply of nickel globally. The country has gone from having two nickel smelters to 27 over the last decade and plans to open 22 more, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.",
      "Nickel was once known mainly for making stainless steel, but demand has skyrocketed as automakers like Tesla use it to make electric vehicle batteries and larger battery makers use it in clean electricity projects.",
      "Rapid growth of Indonesia's nickel industry has already led to environmental degradation across several regions on Sulawesi Island, said Greenpeace forest campaigner Iqbal Damanik.",
      "\u201cNow nickel mining is also threatening Raja Ampat, a place that is often called the last paradise on Earth,\u201d Damanik said.",
      "Over 500 hectares of forest and vegetation have been cleared for nickel mines on the West Papua islands of Gag, Kawe and Manuran, according to Greenpeace Indonesia.",
      "The three islands are classified as small islands. Indonesia\u2019s law on the management of coastal areas and small islands prohibits mining as it could lead to soil runoff and sedimentation that endangers coral reefs and marine ecosystems.",

The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected an appeal by the Apache group, letting lower court rulings stand.",

I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there\u2019s still structure to the way that we want to play.\u201d",

You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don\u2019t, you get punished.\"",

The Angels' Mike Trout hit the longest homer so far, a 484-foot shot against the Giants on April 19, while his teammate Logan O'Hoppe hit one 470 against A's on May 27.",

I don't feel like he's been on fire at any point. That's what is amazing about it. He's out there playing well. Getting his hits, doing his thing. But in a lot of ways, I'm honestly waiting for him to catch fire. That's when it gets really scary.",

But his supporters were in the front rows right next to the home dugout at Fenway Park on Tuesday night when Anthony lined a two-run double to left in the first inning of a 3-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even really notice that they were there until I went out for my first at-bat,\u201d Anthony told reporters, adding with a laugh: \u201cNobody really gave me a heads-up that they were going to be that close.\u201d",
      "Anthony said he didn't interact with his family during the game. But manager Alex Cora looked over from the dugout and saw the 21-year-old's mother, Lori, crying.",
      "\u201cJust to be around and see the smiles \u2014 and saw some tears, too. It\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Cora said. \u201cI know it was a special day for the kid yesterday, but they weren\u2019t here. So to have his family now and get his first knock, that means a lot.\u201d",
      "Anthony had some time to take pictures on the field with the traveling party of about a dozen people \u2014 father, mother, sister, brother, grandparents, agents, a couple friends. He went back on the field in the darkened ballpark to spend some more time with them after talking to reporters.",
      "\u201cThat group out there has been with me every step of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo just to see them here \u2014 they had to miss yesterday unfortunately, it was kind of quick notice \u2014 but to have them here is special for sure.\u201d",
      "A day after going hitless with an RBI groundout in his major league debut, Anthony came up with runners on second and third in the first inning and drove the ball to left to give the Red Sox a 2-0 lead.",
      "Anthony, who let a ball roll under his glove for an error in his debut, also made a sliding catch on Tuesday night on Jonathan Aranda's sinking liner to right-center in the sixth, protecting a one-run lead and earning a salute from pitcher Lucas Giolito.",
      "The second-round draft pick went viral over the weekend when he hit a 497-foot grand slam in Triple-A Worcester. He batted .288 with 10 homers and 29 RBIs in 58 games for the WooSox this season.",
      "The Red Sox said Anthony is the youngest player in franchise history to record three or more RBIs in his first two games. Anthony is 21 years, 28 days old; Jim Rice was 21 years, 164 days old when he did it in 1974.",

      "The once prolific duo at Real Madrid helped Brazil to a 1-0 win over Paraguay at Sao Paulo. Ecuador secured its place at next year's global tournament later Tuesday with a 0-0 draw at Peru.",
      "Defending champion Argentina, held to a 1-1 draw by Colombia, had already qualified and is assured of finishing atop South American qualifying.",
      "Ecuador and Brazil each have 25 points in the standings, but the Ecuadorians are in second spot based on victories. The two nations are 10 points behind Argentina but, crucially, more than six points clear of the seventh-place team with two games remaining in the qualifying campaign.",
      "The top six teams in South America earn direct entries to the 48-team World Cup.",
      "Chile will miss a third consecutive World Cup after losing 2-0 at Bolivia to remain last in 10-nation round-robin competition, a result that cost head coach Ricardo Gareca his job.",
      "Uruguay beat Venezuela at home 2-0, with goals from Rodrigo Aguirre and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, and edged closer to one of the direct spots with 24 points.",
      "Venezuela, with 18, is one ahead of Bolivia in the contest for seventh place that grants an intercontinental playoff berth.",
      "Lionel Messi had a quiet night in Argentina\u2019s draw with Colombia in Buenos Aires. Luis D\u00edaz opened the scoring for the visitors in the 24th minute. Enzo Fernandez was sent off in the 70th minute to the disappointment of more than 80,000 fans at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium.",
      "But Juli\u00e1n Alvarez scored the equalizer in the 81st with a low crossed shot.",
      "Ancelotti received some frustration from fans after Thursday\u2019s 0-0 draw with Ecuador, as his team focused on defending the entire match. The Italian coach, who turned 66 Tuesday, promised changes to make his team more aggressive at the NeoQuimica Arena.",
      "He was welcomed by 46,000 fans, including NBA star Gianni Antetokounmpo, who displayed a tifo in yellow and green that read \u201cParabens, Carleto\u201d (Happy birthday, Carleto in Portuguese).",
      "Gabriel Martinelli replaced midfielder Gerson and was one of the best players of the encounter. Raphinha returned after suspension and created many problems for Paraguay\u2019s defense. And Vinicius J\u00fanior was often seen as a targetman, sharing the duties with Matheus Cunha.",
      "A mistake by Paraguay\u2019s defense, a low cross by Cunha and a gentle touch by Brazil\u2019s new No. 10 produced the only goal of the match. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d the striker told the coach as he celebrated.",
      "Despite the low score, the hosts were much more aggressive than in most of its games in this World Cup qualifying campaign.",
      "\u201cWe needed to win here for our people. Now we have more time to work, see what we can improve,\u201d Vinicius said after the match. He won\u2019t play Brazil\u2019s next game in qualifying against Chile due to suspension. \u201cWe need to celebrate this. After September it is all about the World Cup.\u201d",
      "After the final whistle, a clip of Ancelotti's first days on the job was shown in big screens around the stadium. A raucous celebration erupted again, as if the Italian coach had brought new life to a team that only three months ago appeared lost and doomed.",
      "He said the team was balanced despite having four strikers. He also said that Cunha's role, as a playmaker, is the one he figures will be Neymar's if the veteran fully recovers his fitness.",
      "\u201cIt's no problem to play with three or four up front. We need 10 players to run, to sacrifice,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cRodrygo did this many times, I know him well. And Neymar will also do it.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s golden generation won two Copa America titles \u2014 in 2015 and \u201916 \u2014 but is out of contention for next year\u2019s expanded 48-team tournament.",

      "Colombia, in sixth place with 22 points, will play for its World Cup future against Bolivia and Venezuela. Bolivia will seek its first chance to play at the World Cup since 1994 against the Colombians and then Brazil. Venezuela's rivals will be Argentina and Colombia.",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "PRAGUE -- Czech President Petr Pavel swore in a new justice minister on Tuesday, another step in a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. The new minister is from the same party.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "\u201cThe public trust in the institutions and the state is at stake,\u201d Pavel said.",
      "The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",
      "Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person\u2019s express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",

      "It\u2019s one of crypto\u2019s hottest trends: publicly traded companies buying bitcoin and then buying even more.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers:",
      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",
      "That\u2019s how much of a one-day percentage increase in stock prices firms have seen after recently announcing plans to hold other types of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasuries, highlighting how the appetite for such companies extends beyond bitcoin.",
      "SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.",

      "A Chinese scientist has been arrested while arriving in the U.S. in Detroit",
      "DETROIT -- A Chinese scientist was arrested while arriving in the U.S. at the Detroit airport, the second case in days involving the alleged smuggling of biological material, authorities said Monday.",
      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The scientist was interviewed and arrested Sunday after arriving on a flight from China, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan.",
      "Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said.",
      "The court filing doesn't indicate whether the FBI believes the biological material was risky, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said smuggling \"threatens our security.\"",
      "The scientist remains in custody awaiting a bond hearing Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material,\u201d said Michael Shapira, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the court filing and spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The government last week charged two Chinese scientists who are accused of conspiring to smuggle a toxic fungus into the U.S. One was turned around at the Detroit airport and sent back to China last year, while the other, a researcher at the University of Michigan, was arrested.

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "Hackers tied to China's government have tried repeatedly to access the phones of prominent Americans, part of Beijing's sprawling cyberespionage efforts",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Cybersecurity investigators noticed a highly unusual software crash \u2014 it was affecting a small number of smartphones belonging to people who worked in government, politics, tech and journalism.",
      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",
      "U.S. authorities warned in December of a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign designed to gain access to the texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re finding backdoors in Barbie dolls,\u201d said Antani, now CEO of Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity firm, referring to concerns from researchers who successfully hacked the microphone of a digitally connected version of the toy.",
      "It doesn't matter how secure a mobile device is if the user doesn't follow basic security precautions, especially if their device contains classified or sensitive information, experts say.",
      "Mike Waltz, who departed as Trump's national security adviser, inadvertently added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief to a Signal chat used to discuss military plans with other top officials.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols set up in his office so he could use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, the AP has reported.",
      "Hegseth has rejected assertions that he shared classified information on Signal, a popular encrypted messaging app not approved for the use of communicating classified information.",
      "China and other nations will try to take advantage of such lapses, and national security officials must take steps to prevent them from recurring, said Michael Williams, a national security expert at Syracuse University.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently removed all 17 sitting members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. Who could be on the committee next and what changes may be coming?",
    "story": [
      "The committee has a meeting on some vaccines scheduled for the end of June.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shocked many when he announced all 17 sitting members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's independent vaccine advisory committee would be removed.",
      "In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Kennedy said the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was plagued by conflicts of interest and was a \"rubber stamp\" for all vaccines.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the agency that authorizes or approves vaccines. The ACIP holds public hearings and then has non-binding votes on potential recommendations, and the CDC director finalizes the recommendations.",
      "Currently the CDC director role remains vacant and Kennedy has been making the final recommendations.",
      "Kennedy told ABC News on Tuesday that the replacements for ACIP will not be \"anti-vaxxers\" and that he intends to replace the panel by the end of the month.",
      "\"We're going to be bringing people onto the ACIP panel -- not anti-vaxxers -- we're bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine, who are going to be objective and who are going to follow the science and make critical public health determinations for our children based upon the best science,\" Kennedy said.",
      "But Kennedy also suggested that current list of vaccines that are recommended for children would be re-analyzed by the new ACIP members, because he doesn't trust the science that led to their initial approvals.",
      "A number of public health experts and vaccinologists told ABC News that they are concerned new committee members could lead to changes in which vaccines are no longer covered by public and private insurers, and that committee seats may now be filled by vaccine skeptics without scientific knowledge to evaluate the recommendations.",
      "\"I think it's disingenuous. I don't think this has anything to do with conflict of interest,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who has helped develop several vaccines, told ABC News. \"I think he either wants to get rid of ACIP altogether or stack it with his with people that believe in his ... pseudoscience.\"",
      "Who will the new members of the committee be?",
      "The ACIP is comprised of up to 19 voting members, six ex officio members representing other federal agencies and 30 non-voting representatives of liaison organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.",
      "The panel develops recommendations on the use of vaccines in the U.S including timing and dosage or if there are situations in which a vaccine should not be used.",
      "According to the CDC, ACIP makes recommendations on incorporating licensed new vaccines into the current immunization schedule as well as recommendations on vaccine formulations. It also reviews older vaccines to consider revising its recommendations.",
      "The CDC sets immunization schedules for adults and children based on ACIP recommendations.",
      "The members removed by Kennedy include experts in pediatrics, infectious diseases, global public health, epidemiology and family medicine.",
      "Among them was Dr. Noel Brewer, a professor in the department of health behavior at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.",
      "According to his biography page on the school's website, he has been a co-author in the publication of more than 375 papers examining vaccination, tobacco use, medical screening and other cancer-related health behaviors.",
      "Brewer told ABC News Live he and his colleagues did not see the purge coming and said he learned of it from journalists contacting him and asking if he saw Kennedy's op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.",
      "He said that ACIP has one of the strictest set of rules around conflict-of-interest of any committee he's been part of and there's no evidence of members voting in favor of products because of personal, or business, interests.",
      "\"They work really hard to make sure that we don't have the conflicts of interest,\" Brewer said. \"So, I can't accept any money from a drug company. I cannot accept any sort of funding from them. I can't be part of a lawsuit against a drug company. None of that stuff is possible.\"",
      "The CDC has published a list of conflicts of interest declarations disclosed by voting members during public meetings since 2000, which was most recently updated in early March.",
      "Dr. Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco -- whose research focuses on legal and policy issues related to vaccines -- told ABC News very few members of the committee have conflicts of interest, and those who do announce them at the beginning of the meeting and don't vote on those issues.",
      "Brewer said he assumes Kennedy's new nominations will \"have the same level of vaccine skepticism as the current secretary, but it's hard to know, and I'm just hoping for the best.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News, \"Secretary Kennedy is committed to restoring public trust in vaccine policy by ensuring that advisory panels like ACIP are guided by independent, gold standard science -- free from conflicts of interest and ideology.\"",
      "Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute -- who previously served two terms on the ACIP and then two terms as a liaison -- told ABC News there's only speculation as to whom Kennedy will select because no names have been announced.",
      "However, he added he doesn't have concerns as long as the new members bring \"some domain of expertise\" and \"adhere to the rigor of the scientific method.\"",
      "\"Presumably, the criteria will be around a concept that the administration has announced called 'Gold Standard Science,'\" Poland said, referring to Trump's executive order in late May that seeks to promote the standard through replication, transparency, unbiased peer review and without conflicts of interest.",
      "\"I think a definition of 'gold standard science' is appropriate. We know what that means in the scientific field, and then if you array experts who adhere to gold standard science, that's a good thing,\" he continued.",
      "Reiss said the timing of Kennedy's announcement comes just prior to an upcoming ACIP meeting scheduled to be held between June 25 and June 27 to discuss new recommendations for several vaccines, including the HPV vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "\"That's a really short time for vetting members, which usually takes months,\" she told ABC News. \"The first question is: is Kennedy going to try to quickly put in a range of names, which would suggest that he either has been preparing a roster for a long time, or is he going to do it really quickly?\"",
      "Could any changes be coming to vaccine recommendations?",
      "Reiss said if the new ACIP members make any changes to vaccine recommendations, it could lead to changes related to insurance coverage.",
      "Private insurance providers are required under the Affordable Care Act to cover ACIP recommendations, but not required to cover others, she said.",
      "Additionally, the federal Vaccine for Children program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them, automatically covers vaccines recommended by ACIP and approved by the CDC.",
      "For adults, Medicare covers costs of ACIP-recommended vaccines for patients with Part D plans, and state Medicaid agencies are required to cover costs for most beneficiaries receiving ACIP-recommended vaccinations.",
      "If ACIP no longer recommends certain vaccines, federal programs may not be required to cover costs for adults or children.",
      "\"It could dramatically affect access, because people might not be able to cover childhood routine vaccines, which means that people who want to vaccinate their children won't be able to and it could affect the willingness of providers to give them,\" Reiss said.",
      "Reiss said ACIP changing recommendations for vaccines could also affect the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which provides compensation for vaccine injuries if the CDC recommends the category of vaccine for routine administration to children or pregnant women.",

      "The White House on Wednesday attempted to clarify President Donald Trump's threat the day before to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade this weekend in Washington celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary.",
      "\"The president supports peaceful protests,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a White House briefing after Trump on Tuesday did not distinguish between peaceful and violent protesters.",
      "\"He supports the First Amendment. He supports the right of Americans to make their voices heard,\" she added, after being asked what Trump would allow at the parade given his military response to the protests against his immigration policies in Los Angeles. \"He does not support violence of any kind. He does not support assaulting law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their job.\"",
      "\"It's very clear for the president what he supports and what he does not,\" she said. \"Unfortunately for Democrats, that line is not been made clear, and they've allowed this unrest in this violence to continue, and the president has had to step in.\"",
      "The president's comments on Tuesday said protesters would be \"met with heavy force\" if they arrived in Washington for the parade, which occurs days after he sent the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against operations conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"These are people who hate our country,\" he said in the Oval Office.",
      "\"We're going to celebrate big on Saturday,\" Trump added. \"If any protesters want to come out, they will be met with very big force.\"",
      "U.S. Secret Service and local D.C. officials have said they only expect several small protests at Saturday's parade, and Trump himself on Tuesday night appeared to soften his earlier Oval Office comments somewhat, saying, \"As long as we have the military there, the protests won't mean anything.\"",
      "\"The military will be very heavy force -- very proud to tell you that,\" he told reporters who had asked him what he meant. \"They might as well turn around. They're wasting their time.\"",
      "Tall fencing has been set up and other security measures have been taken around Washington in the lead-up to the parade -- measures the White House said are purely \"proactive\" and not in reaction to the protests in Los Angeles.",
      "\"These are proactive security measures to protect those marching in the parade, many of whom will be veterans, and our brave men and women in uniform and Gold Star families,\" Leavitt said. \"And of course, it's to protect the spectators who will be enjoying this incredibly patriotic show on Saturday.\"",
      "Leavitt's comments came as the first soldiers arrive in the district for the parade.",
      "Approximately 6,700 soldiers will participate, and there will be eight marching bands, 24 horses, two mules and a dog.",
      "Dozens of tanks, military vehicles, howitzers and various aircraft, including those used in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, will be on display, and the Army on Wednesday added rocket launchers and precision-guided missiles to the festivities.",
      "The White House also made a last-minute request for the Air Force's Thunderbirds to fly over the parade, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The event has grown considerably in size in recent months, with a parade added after Trump's inauguration.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",
      "The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress\u2019 move to block them.",
      "Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThis is not the United States of California.\u201d",
      "It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will \u201chelp align emissions standards with today\u2019s market realities.\u201d",

      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement they issued",
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement.",
      "A statement published online by the board members said the administration usurped the board\u2019s authority by denying awards to \u201ca substantial number of people\u201d who already had been chosen. Another 1,200 award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\u201cTo continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board\u2019s request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars, and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the scholarship program.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermined the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\u201cWe believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration\u2019s efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation\u2019s most respected and valuable programs.\u201d",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "The announcement comes as the Trump administration ratchets up scrutiny of international students on several fronts. The administration has expanded the grounds for revoking foreign students' legal status, and recently paused scheduling of new interviews for student visas as it increases vetting of their social media activity. The government also has moved to block foreign students from attending Harvard as it pressures the Ivy League school to adopt a series of reforms.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to eliminate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.",
      "The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to \u201c unleash American energy \u201d and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.",
      "If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.",
      "The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\u201d",
      "Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations\u2019 \u201cwar on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that \u2026 no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living \u2026 create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.\u201d",
      "Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals \u201cyet another in a series of attacks\u201d by the Trump administration on the nation's \u201chealth, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.\u201d",
      "She called it \u201cunconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we\u2019ll see them in court.\u201d",
      "The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.",
      "It\u2019s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated \u2014 they can\u2019t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.",
      "Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead \u2014 and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth\u2019s warming to deadlier levels.",
      "Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.",
      "The power sector is the nation\u2019s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.",
      "In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants \u201cdo not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution\u201d or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants \u201care a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: \u201cThis Administration\u2019s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.\u201d",
      "The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.",
      "If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA\u2019s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don\u2019t either and therefore shouldn\u2019t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.",
      "The EPA proposal \u201chas the potential to have much, much broader implications,\u201d she said.",
      "Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to \u201csuffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,\u201d with the intent to regulate the coal industry \u201cout of existence\u201d and make it \u201cdisappear.\u201d",
      "National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove \u201cdeliberately unattainable standards\u201d for clean air while \u201cleveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.\u201d",
      "But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.",
      "\u201cThe world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,\u201d Frumkin said. \u201cThese are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.",
      "\u201cCarbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,\u201d said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in \u201csignificant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending his decision to order National Guard troops to provide security during immigrations raids in Los Angeles",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his decision to order troops to provide security during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, telling senators on Wednesday it's about \u201cmaintaining law and order.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., condemned the move as illegal, saying it erodes military readiness and questioning how it is being funded. It was the second day of harsh congressional questioning for Hegseth on the deployment of troops over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, continued military aid to Ukraine, a deal on a gifted Qatari jet and more.",
      "\u201cThe mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\u201d Hegseth said in response to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored confusion about the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to provide security at the immigration protests and operations in Los Angeles. Photos have shown Guard troops setting a security perimeter around agents as they make arrests in the city, moving them closer to law enforcement functions, which by law they are not allowed to do.",
      "About 2,000 of the Guard soldiers are in place in Los Angeles, initially sent to provide security. The Marines are at a nearby base and have not yet been used.",
      "Speaking at a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing, Reed said law and order is a civil function, not a job for the U.S. military. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., added that the California deployment, along with President Donald Trump's threat to use force against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday, \u201cshould stop every one of us cold.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cthreatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. It is unconstitutional. And it is downright un-American.\u201d",
      "Asked later what constitutional authority the department is using to deploy active duty Marines to the protests, Hegseth said he didn't know the specific provision but would provide it.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Hegseth, was asked whether he sees evidence of \u201crebellion\u201d in the U.S. That could be used to invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement functions.",
      "\u201cThere are definitely some frustrated folks out there,\u201d Caine said in response.",
      "Answering the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s argument that \u201cthere has been an invasion\u201d of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.",
      "Caine, asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I\u2019ll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also faced bipartisan criticism for failing to provide details about the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget and over an array of other decisions he's made during his tenure.",
      "The panel's chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators expressed frustration that Congress has not yet gotten a full defense budget from the Trump administration and that the current level does not have the U.S. spending enough on defense.",
      "McConnell also noted that the limited budget request that lawmakers have received has no funding for Ukraine security assistance, questioning whether that makes \u201clasting peace\u201d more or less likely.",
      "Hegseth, in his opening remarks, said the department needed more time to pull a spending plan together but that he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine makes America look strong, even though Russia is the aggressor. He said the budget includes hard choices and \u201creflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.\"",
      "Hegseth said some U.S. security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline, but he provided no details.",
      "Hegseth repeatedly refused to provide details on plans for the Defense Department to accept a 747 jet offered by Qatar for use as Air Force One. He said budgeting and schedules for security upgrades to turn the plane into the president's aircraft are classified.",
      "Hegseth confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the military to take possession of the aircraft.",
      "That also means no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the Qatari jet.",
      "He refused to answer questions on the cost or potential timeframe of that upgrade \u2014 even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned by Boeing to serve as Air Force One is public.",
      "\u201cA memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,\u201d Hegseth said.",

      "President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is looking to cancel $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress. That's just a sliver of the $1.7 trillion that lawmakers OK'd for the budget year ending Sept. 30.",
      "The package of 21 budget rescissions will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress for the cuts to take place, beginning with a House vote expected Thursday. Otherwise, the spending remains in place.",
      "The White House is betting that cutting federal investments in public media and some foreign aid programs will prove politically popular. Republicans say if this first effort is successful, they hope more rescission packages will follow as they look to continue work by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency once run by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Democrats describe the cuts as inhumane and say they would rip life-saving support from hungry and sick people across the globe. Republicans are describing the cuts as \u201cmodest\u201d and say the U.S. will continue to play a critical role in helping the world's most vulnerable people.",
      "Here's a look at some of the spending the White House is trying to claw back:",
      "The Republican president has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it's slated to receive during the next two budget years. Congress has traditionally provided public media with advanced funds to reduce political pressures.",
      "The corporation distributes the money mostly to public television and radio stations around the country, with some assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "Much of the conservatives' ire is focused on NPR and PBS. \u201cWe believe that you all can hate us on your own dime,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, during a hearing in March.",
      "But about two-thirds of the money goes to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "\u201cThey want to punish the national guys, that's fine,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican who said he was undecided going into this week's vote. \u201cBut I'm trying to get a handle on what it means for my stations in Nevada, because the ability to fundraise at the national level ain't the same as the ability to fundraise in Reno.\u201d",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the GOP bill passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Meanwhile, local radio stations say their share of the allocation provides funding for 386 stations employing nearly 10,000 people. Dozens of stations rely on the public grants for more than half of their budget. Many others for nearly half.",
      "Some Republicans say they worry about what the cuts would mean for local public stations but tough decisions are necessary.",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said South Dakota Public Broadcasting does a \u201creally good job of covering the state Legislature\" and other public affairs.",
      "\u201cSo these rescissions are not going to be comfortable for South Dakota to deal with,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat being said, we're $37 trillion in debt.\"",
      "Trump's administration is looking to claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs.",
      "That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The administration says the $500 million rescission for infectious diseases would not reduce treatment but would \u201celiminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and equity programs.\u201d It makes a similar assurance on the HIV funding, saying it would eliminate \u201conly those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d",
      "Scores of humanitarian aid groups have asked lawmakers to oppose the proposed cuts. Catholic Relief Services called on donors to contact their members of Congress to urge them to vote against the bill. Without the U.S. assistance, \"countless lives are at risk, and the needs will continue to rise,\u201d said the plea to supporters.",
      "The importance of the United States' contribution to the global\u202fHIV\u202fresponse cannot be overstated, according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. It says the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has saved more than 26 million lives and averted almost 5 million new HIV infections since it was launched in 2003 under President George W. Bush, a Republican.",
      "\u201cInstead of facing a death sentence, people supported by PEPFAR are raising families, building their communities, and helping their communities grow and develop,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.",
      "The Trump administration is looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country. The program also helps vetted refugees who come to the U.S. get started in their new country.",

      "Refugees International urged Congress to reject what it described as a reckless proposal.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The administration wants to claw back $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion approved for the Development Assistance program at the U.S. Agency for International Development and about $1.7 billion, or nearly half of the funds, dedicated to the State Department's Economic Support Fund.",
      "The administration says in its request to Congress that the Development Assistance account is supposed to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient democratic societies, but in practice many of the programs \u201cconflict with American values\u201d and bankroll corrupt leaders' evasion of responsibilities to their citizens while providing \"no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d",

      "The upcoming parade in Washington to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary has divided veterans",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- James McDonough served in the U.S. Army for 27 years, fighting in Vietnam and delivering humanitarian aid to Rwanda. For him, Saturday\u2019s military parade in Washington for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 coinciding with President Donald Trump's birthday \u2014 is about the resilience of a vital institution and the nation it serves.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers marching that day represent all of that history,\u201d said McDonough, 78, of Crofton, Maryland. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent a single day. They don\u2019t represent a single person. It\u2019s the American Army still standing straight, walking tall, ready to defend our country.\u201d",
      "Christopher Purdy, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, called the parade a facade that paints over some of the Republican president\u2019s policies that have targeted military veterans and current service members, including cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a ban on transgender troops.",
      "Purdy said the parade, long sought by Trump, will needlessly display U.S. military might on the president\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Purdy, 40, of Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. And whatever his reasons are for doing it, I think it\u2019s entirely unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Until recently, the Army\u2019s long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.",
      "Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.",
      "Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.",
      "The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.",
      "Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be \u201ca big day\" and noted \"we want to show off a little bit.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our greatness and our achievements,\" he said. \"This week, we honor 250 years of valor and glory and triumph by the greatest fighting force ever to walk the face of the Earth: the United States Army.\u201d",
      "For Edmundo Eugenio Martinez Jr., an Army veteran who fought in Iraq, the parade is a missed opportunity to honor generations of veterans, many of whom paid a steep price and came home to little fanfare.",
      "\u201cSadly, the timing and the optics and divisive politics have ruined it,\u201d said Martinez, 48, of Katy, Texas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not picking one side or the other. Both sides are guilty.\u201d",
      "Joe Plenzler, a retired Marine who fought in Iraq, said Trump wants to see troops saluting him on his birthday as tanks roll past.",
      "\u201cIt's just suspicious,\" the 53-year-old from Middletown, Virginia, said of the timing.",
      "\u201cI absolutely love the Army from the bottom of my cold black Marine heart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Army\u2019s birthday was a day later, we probably wouldn't be doing it. I\u2019d rather see that $50 million take care of the men and women who went off to war and came back with missing arms, legs and eyeballs, and with damaged brains.\u201d",
      "Joe Kmiech, who served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard from 1989 to 1998, supports the parade because the Army is \"part of American culture and our fabric.\u201d",
      "He notes the Army's pioneering contributions to engineering and medicine, from dams to new surgical techniques. Like many veterans, he has a strong familial connection: His father served in the Army, and so did his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn't vote for President Trump, but the commander in chief is going to be part of that celebration,\u201d said Kmiech, 54, of Roberts, Wisconsin. \u201cThe distinction needs to be made that the parade is a celebration of our Army, not of a person.\u201d",
      "For Gulf War Army veteran Paul Sullivan, Trump and the parade are inextricably linked.",
      "\u201cThis Trump tank travesty is all about stroking Trump\u2019s ego,\u201d said Sullivan, 62, who lives outside Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cIf Trump truly cared about our service members, he would sit down with them quietly and say, \u2018What can we do with $50 million or $100 million to make your lives better?\u2019 He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "McDonough, the veteran from Crofton, Maryland, disagrees that the parade is about Trump or too costly. He said the U.S. held a grand celebration in New York after World War II when the nation was deeply in debt.",
      "\u201cWe certainly need to bring our debt down, and we certainly need to take care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a false dichotomy. It\u2019s like saying if we bought two less aircraft carriers, we could do so much better to take care of our poor.\u201d",
      "And McDonough said soldiers' oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump.",
      "The president \u201cunderstands the importance of doing this, not only for the Army, but for the nation,\u201d McDonough said.",
      "Purdy, the veteran from Atlanta, said the parade's brazen flex of military strength is not an American tradition, particularly absent a recent victory.",
      "\u201cI'm not saying we shouldn't celebrate the country,\" he said. \u201cBut for us to be projecting this type of hard power, in such a real in-your-face way, that\u2019s just not who we are.\u201d",
      "Trump is brushing aside old alliances and foreign aid that have helped maintain peace for decades, Purdy asserted.",
      "\u201cIt signals a real dark turn if we\u2019re just going to roll out the tanks,\" Purdy said.",
      "Michael Nardotti, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, said military hardware has long been in American parades, which can help recruitment.",
      "More important, he said, is the tremendous value in the public seeing soldiers' faces in a parade when active-duty troops make up less than 1% of the population.",
      "\u201c'People are the Army,'\u201d said Nardotti, 78, of Aldie, Virginia, quoting a former Army chief of staff.",
      "Nardotti said he'll listen carefully to Trump's speech.",
      "\u201cI hope it sends the right message,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate are heading to federal court to argue that the state is not properly carrying out executions",
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate will be in federal court Wednesday trying to convince a judge that the state is not properly carrying out lethal injections or firing squad executions, an argument meant to spare the prisoner just two days before he's scheduled to die.",
      "Stephen Stanko's attorneys said the two doses of lethal injection drugs used in the past three executions by that method show those subjected to the procedure have died a lingering death, still conscious as they felt like they were drowning when fluid rushed into their lungs.",
      "Stanko changed his mind and decided to die by lethal injection because of accounts about the last firing squad death.",
      "In that April execution, the volunteer shooters nearly missed Mikal Mahdi's heart, meaning the man convicted of killing an off-duty police officer took three to four times as long to die as he was supposed to, Stanko's lawyers said in court papers.",
      "One expert hired by Stanko's attorneys said the evidence suggests the firing squad may have aimed slightly below the target or the target was not placed on Mahdi's heart to \u201ccause great pain before his death,\u201d according to court papers filed last week.",
      "Lawyers for the state vigorously denied the claims. They point out that the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected a similar last-ditch appeal on May 28. They said every execution is different and that lawyers representing incarcerated people have not proven any condemned prisoner suffered gratuitous pain.",
      "\u201cSo (perhaps) it\u2019s not the method that\u2019s the issue \u2014 instead, these inmates just don\u2019t want to have their sentences carried out and are willing to make any argument that they can,\u201d wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.",
      "Lawyers for the state will ask federal Judge Richard Gergel on Wednesday to dismiss the claims.",
      "Stanko would be the sixth inmate executed in South Carolina in nine months. There were originally four executions scheduled around the country this week, one in South Carolina and one each in Florida and Alabama. On Monday, an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay to a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Stanko, 57, is slated to die at 6 p.m. Friday at a Columbia prison for killing his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s Horry County home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her Georgetown County home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials. Stanko was also sentenced to death in that case.",
      "Stanko's lawyers, in their 49-page brief, include a number of ways their experts think South Carolina is improperly carrying out executions.",
      "They include using bullets in the firing squad that aren't powerful enough to guarantee the heart will be destroyed, failing to properly oversee how an IV line is placed for lethal injections and improper storage of the powerful sedative pentobarbital, which is used to kill inmates.",
      "The lawyers said the state is using two doses of pentobarbital in executions because \u2014 while inmates might be paralyzed by the drug \u2014 they remain conscious enough to feel like they are drowning and take longer than 10 minutes to die.",
      "Attorneys for the state said witnesses to the executions have not reported any signs of distress and said the inmates appeared to stop breathing within a minute or two.",
      "The most serious accusations in Stanko's lawsuit come from Dr. Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cI am concerned that some element of those responsible for carrying out Mr. Mahdi\u2019s execution intended not to hit his target and to cause great pain before his death,\u201d Groner wrote.",
      "State Correction Department officials deny anything went wrong in Mahdi's execution. Agency leaders have signed sworn statements saying that all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber after Mahdi's lawyers suggested one shot missed entirely.",
      "\u201cHow bullets react once they strike the body is something that neither SCDC nor the members of the firing squad can control. That one condemned inmate dies more quickly than another does not necessarily mean that something went awry in one execution,\u201d the state said.",
      "Complicating any investigation into Madhi's death is an inadequate autopsy. It did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified. Only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body and there were no close-ups of the wounds. The inmate's clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed or how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused, according to forensic pathologist Terri Haddix of California, one of the defense experts.",
      "Stanko's lawyers want to pause his execution to take a closer look at Mahdi's death and require the three firing squad members to take a sworn oath they will \u201cshoot at the target in good faith.\u201d",

      "Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together to demand that the Trump administration stop the stepped-up immigration raids that have spread fear across their cities and sparked protests across the U.S. They also called on Preside...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand that the Trump administration stop the stepped-up immigration raids that have spread fear across their cities and sparked protests across the U.S.",
      "But there were no signs President Donald Trump would heed their pleas.",
      "About 500 of the National Guard troops deployed to the Los Angeles protests have been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations, the commander in charge said Wednesday. And while some troops have already gone on such missions, he said it\u2019s too early to say if that will continue even after the protests die down.",
      "\u201cWe are expecting a ramp-up,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman said, noting that protests across the nation were being discussed. \u201cI\u2019m focused right here in LA, what\u2019s going on right here. But you know, I think we\u2019re, we\u2019re very concerned.\u201d",
      "A demonstration in Los Angeles\u2019 civic center Wednesday evening just before the second night of the city\u2019s downtown curfew was set to start, suddenly turned chaotic, as police in riot gear \u2014 many on horseback \u2014 charged at a group, striking them with wooden rods and pushing them out of a park in front of City Hall. Officers also fired crowd control projectiles, striking at least one young woman, who writhed in pain on the ground as she bled from her hip.",
      "It wasn\u2019t clear what initiated the confrontation. But minutes earlier, some protesters had lit fireworks as they approached the federal building, the site of numerous showdowns in recent nights. Simultaneously, a larger portion of the protest had been in the midst of a dance party.",
      "\u201cIt was chill the whole time, it was cool vibes, peaceful protesting,\u201d said Raymond Martinez. \u201cOnce we got by the federal building the horses started coming.\"",
      "The LA-area mayors and city council members urged Trump to stop using armed military troops alongside immigration agents during the raids.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,\u201d said Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount, who said she was hit by rubber bullets over the weekend. \u201cYou need to stop these raids.\u201d",
      "Speaking alongside the other mayors at a news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the raids spread fear at the behest of the White House. The city\u2019s nightly curfew that started Tuesday will remain in effect as long as necessary in a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section of downtown. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).",
      "\u201cIf there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,\u201d Bass said.",
      "Those who have been caught up in the nationwide raids include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court.",
      "The administration has cited the protests in its decision to deploy the military. Referring to the demonstrations, which have been mostly concentrated in the LA business district, the Democratic mayor added: \u201cIf you drive a few blocks outside of downtown, you don\u2019t know that anything is happening in the city at all.\u201d",
      "California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has asked a federal court to put an emergency stop to the military helping immigration agents in the nation\u2019s second-largest city. This week, guardsmen began standing protectively around agents as they carry out arrests. A judge set a hearing for Thursday.",
      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\" in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The military is now closer to engaging in law enforcement actions such as deportations, as Trump has promised in his crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests must be made by law enforcement.",
      "The president posted on the Truth Social platform that the city \u201cwould be burning to the ground\u201d if he had not sent in the military.",
      "Some 2,000 National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles, and are soon to be joined by 2,000 more along with about 700 Marines, Sherman said.",
      "Speaking in an interview with The Associated Press and ABC, Sherman initially said that National Guard troops had already temporarily detained civilians in the Los Angeles protests over immigration raids. He later said he based his comments on photos and footage he had seen that turned out not to be a representation of Guard members in Los Angeles.",
      "Police detained more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of the curfew and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters.",
      "But there were fewer clashes than on previous nights, and by daybreak, the downtown streets were bustling with residents walking dogs and commuters clutching coffee cups.",
      "Los Angeles police have made nearly 400 arrests and detentions since Saturday, the vast majority of which were for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to the police department.",
      "There have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against police officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine police officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injures. Some were transported to a hospital and released.",
      "Demonstrations have also spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin in Texas, and Chicago and New York, where thousands rallied and more arrests were made.",
      "In New York City, police said they took 86 people into custody during protests in lower Manhattan that lasted into Wednesday morning. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful.",
      "A 66-year-old woman in Chicago was injured when she was struck by a car during downtown protests Tuesday evening, police said. Video showed a car speeding down a street where people were protesting.",
      "In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said Texas National Guard troops were \u201con standby\" in areas where demonstrations are planned.",
      "Guard members were sent to San Antonio, but Police Chief William McManus said he had not been told how many troops were deployed or their role ahead of planned protests Wednesday night and Saturday. Officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety said the Texas National Guard was present at a protest downtown.",
      "The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.",
      "Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected. The commander of the troops deployed to Los Angeles initially told the AP that National Guard members had already detained some civilians. He later said his information was incorrect and Guard members have not detained civilians. This story also corrects a quote that was misattributed to Mayor Jessica Ancona of El Monte. It was said by Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to erase his criminal conviction is heading to a federal appeals court",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to erase his criminal conviction heads to a federal appeals court Wednesday. It\u2019s one way he\u2019s trying to get last year\u2019s hush money verdict overturned.",
      "A three-judge panel is set to hear arguments in Trump's long-running fight to get the New York case moved from state court to federal court, where he could then try to have the verdict thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.",
      "The Republican is asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower-court judge twice rejected the move. As part of the request, Trump wants the federal appeals court to seize control of the criminal case and then ultimately decide his appeal of the verdict, which is now pending in a state appellate court.",
      "The 2nd Circuit should \u201cdetermine once and for all that this unprecedented criminal prosecution of a former and current President of the United States belongs in federal court,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in a court filing.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted Trump\u2019s case, wants it to stay in state court. Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 now partly run by his former criminal defense lawyers \u2014 backs his bid to move the case to federal court.",
      "If Trump loses, he could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies her claim and said he did nothing wrong. It was the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers first sought to move the case to federal court following his March 2023 indictment, arguing that federal officers including former presidents have the right to be tried in federal court for charges arising from \u201cconduct performed while in office.\u201d Part of the criminal case involved checks he wrote while he was president.",
      "They tried again after his conviction, arguing that Trump\u2019s historic prosecution violated his constitutional rights and ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling, which was decided about a month after the hush money trial ended.",
      "The ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president\u2019s unofficial actions were illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied both requests, ruling in part that Trump\u2019s conviction involved his personal life, not his work as president.",
      "In a four-page ruling, Hellerstein wrote that nothing about the high court\u2019s ruling affected his prior conclusion that hush money payments at issue in Trump\u2019s case \u201cwere private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision, and that prosecutors erred by showing jurors evidence that should not have been allowed under the ruling, such as former White House staffers describing how Trump reacted to news coverage of the hush money deal and tweets he sent while president in 2018.",
      "Trump\u2019s former criminal defense lawyer Todd Blanche is now the deputy U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department\u2019s second-in-command. Another of his lawyers, Emil Bove, has a high-ranking Justice Department position.",
      "The trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected Trump\u2019s requests to throw out the conviction on presidential immunity grounds and sentenced him on Jan. 10 to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.",
      "Appearing by video at his sentencing, Trump called the case a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d \u201ca weaponization of government\u201d and \u201can embarrassment to New York.\u201d",

      "Survivors and family members of the Pulse nightclub massacre nine years ago are getting a chance to walk through the long-shuttered, gay-friendly venue this week",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Survivors and family members of the 49 victims killed in the Pulse nightclub massacre nine years ago are getting their first chance Wednesday to walk through the long-shuttered, LGBTQ+ friendly Florida venue before it is razed and replaced with a permanent memorial to what was once the worst U.S. mass shooting in modern times.",
      "In small groups over four days, survivors and family members of those killed planned to spend a half hour inside the space where Omar Mateen opened fire during a Latin night celebration on June 12, 2016, leaving 49 dead and 53 wounded. Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed after a three-hour standoff with police.",
      "At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Pulse shooting\u2019s death toll was surpassed the following year when 58 people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22,000 at a country music festival in Las Vegas.",
      "The city of Orlando purchased the Pulse property in 2023 for $2 million and plans to build a $12 million permanent memorial that will open in 2027. Those efforts follow a multiyear, botched attempt by a private foundation run by the club's former owner. The existing structure will be razed later this year.",
      "\u201cNone of us thought that it would take nine years to get to this point, and we can\u2019t go back and relitigate all of the failures along the way that have happened. But what we can do is control how we move forward together,\u201d Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said two weeks ago when county commissioners pledged $5 million to support the city of Orlando\u2019s plan.",
      "The opportunity to go inside the nightclub comes on the ninth anniversary of the mass shooting. Outside, oversize photos of the victims, rainbow-colored flags and flowers have hung on fences in a makeshift memorial, and the site has attracted visitors from around the globe. But very few people other than investigators have been inside the structure.",
      "Around 250 survivors and family members of those killed have responded to the city's invitation to walk through the nightclub this week. Families of the 49 people who were killed can visit the site with up to six people in their group, and survivors can bring one person with them. The club has been cleaned and lighting has been installed ahead of the walk-throughs.",
      "The people invited to visit are being given the chance to ask FBI agents who investigated the massacre about what happened. They won't be allowed to take photos or video inside.",
      "Brandon Wolf, who hid in a bathroom as the gunman opened fire, said he wasn't going to visit, primarily because he now lives in Washington. He said he wanted to remember Pulse as it was before.",
      "\u201cI will say that the site of the tragedy is where I feel closest to the people who were stolen from me,\u201d said Wolf, who is now national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group. \u201cFor survivors, the last time they were in that space was the worst night possible. It will be really hard to be in that space again.\u201d",
      "Mental health counselors planned to be on hand to talk to those who walk through the building.",
      "Survivors and family members had hoped to have a permanent memorial in place by now. An earlier effort by a private foundation to build one floundered, and the organization disbanded in 2023.",
      "Barbara and Rosario Poma and business owner Michael Panaggio previously owned the property, and Barbara Poma was the executive director of the onePulse Foundation \u2014 the nonprofit that had been leading efforts to build a memorial and museum. She stepped down as executive director in 2022 and then left the organization in 2023 amid criticism that she wanted to sell instead of donate the property. There were also complaints about the lack of progress despite millions of dollars being raised.",
      "The original project, unveiled in 2019 by the onePulse Foundation, called for a museum and permanent memorial costing $45 million. That estimate eventually soared to $100 million. The city of Orlando has since outlined a more modest proposal and scrapped plans for a museum.",
      "\u201cThe building may come down, and we may finally get a permanent memorial, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this community has been scarred for life,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThere are people inside the community who still need and will continue to need support and resources.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinstein'ssex crimes retrial are drilling down on one of the three charges against him: a rape accusation from a woman who also said she had a consensual relationship with him.",
      "The seven female and five male jurors started their fifth day of deliberations Wednesday by re-hearing Jessica Mann's testimony that he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Mann's accusation was an apparent focus of Tuesday\u2019s deliberations, and the jury ended the day by asking to be re-read her testimony about what happened between her and Weinstein at the hotel. The group also indicated it wanted to continue privately reviewing her emails with Weinstein and some 2017 medical records concerning her reaction to news accounts of other women\u2019s allegations against him.",
      "Some jurors appeared to take fresh notes Wednesday, while others sat impassively as court stenographers read aloud the requested parts of Mann's days-long testimony. The jury had already reheard some of the passages last week.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to raping Mann and to forcing oral sex on two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola. The Oscar-winning producer and former Hollywood powerbroker maintains that he never sexually assaulted or raped anyone, and his lawyers portrayed his accusers as opportunists who accepted his advances because they wanted a leg up in the entertainment world.",
      "While all three women stayed in contact with Weinstein despite what they say were assaults, Mann had a particularly complex history with him. She testified that they had a consensual relationship that exploded into rape, yet continued afterward.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry\u2019s most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "He originally was convicted in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola\u2019s allegation was added last year, after New York state\u2019s highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial. Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "After a couple of days of apparent interpersonal friction, the retrial jury worked through Tuesday with no further complaints.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Jacob Vasquez began working at a clothing warehouse in Los Angeles soon after arriving from Mexico less than three years ago.",
      "He is among dozens of workers detained by federal immigration authorities in a series of raids in LA\u2019s fashion district and at Home Depot parking lots in Southern California. More than 100 people have been detained.",
      "The raids have triggered days of turbulent protests across the city and beyond and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the LA area, the latest development in the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. Protests in the city\u2019s downtown have ranged from peaceful to raucous, with demonstrators blocking a major freeway and setting cars on fire over the weekend.",
      "Immigrant advocates say the workers who were detained do not have criminal histories and are being denied their due process rights.",
      "Vasquez has a three-month-old baby, according to his family who spoke to reporters outside the Ambiance Apparel warehouse, a clothing company founded in 1999, and where the young father worked.",
      "\u201cJacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\u201d said his brother Gabriel, speaking in Spanish during a news conference Monday. He doesn't know if he\u2019s OK, he later said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass denounced the raids and the deployment of troops, saying Tuesday that the actions were aimed at intimidating the area's vast immigrant population, one of the country's largest. She said she has heard even immigrants with legal status are being swept up and that the raids may continue for months.",
      "An estimated 950,000 people in Los Angeles County do not have legal immigration status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That is about a tenth of the county's population, and they include cooks, nannies, hotel employees, street vendors, gardeners, construction workers and garment workers.",
      "\u201cFamilies across the city are terrified,\" Bass said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they should go to work, they don\u2019t know if they should go to school.\u201d",
      "She said many of those detained have had no contact with their loved ones or lawyers. The raids have only fueled unrest in the city, Bass said.",
      "\u201cThey were going to go after violent felons, drug dealers, and I don\u2019t know how that matches with the scenes that we saw of people outside Home Depot running through the parking lot, because they were afraid that they were going to get arrested,\" she said.",
      "Sara\u00ed Ortiz said her father, Jose, worked for Ambiance for 18 years. \u201cIt was really painful to see him arrested on Friday with his co-workers,\u201d she told the crowd in Spanish.",
      "A judge signed a search warrant that there was probable cause to conclude that Ambiance was using fake documents for some workers, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not shared details about the arrests.",
      "\u201cAmbience Apparel has never created any fictitious documents for its workers,\" Benjamin N. Gluck, an attorney representing the company, said in a statement. \"The company obeys, and continues to obey, all applicable laws. We support our workforce, many of whom have worked faithfully for the company for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration did not respond to emails from The Associated Press asking about whether any of the immigrants detained in the raids had criminal records.",
      "Los Angeles is one of the nation\u2019s largest garment-production hubs with more than 45,000 workers, mostly Latino and Asian immigrants, who cut, sew and finish the clothing, according to the Garment Worker Center.",
      "The raids are deepening fears far beyond LA and even among those who are in the country legally, immigrants said. Jot Condie, president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, said the fear is keeping away workers and hurting businesses. In LA County last year, food and drink services were a $30 billion industry.",
      "Outside a Home Depot in Santa Ana, California, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, a handful of day laborers leaned against their cars waiting to be hired Tuesday, a day after armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers drove up and sent many of the workers running.",
      "Junior Ortega, 43, said he saw four people arrested by ICE, while others fled on foot or jumped into a car and peeled out of the parking lot before they were caught.",
      "\u201cThey came out with guns, (saying) \u2018don\u2019t move,' \u2019\u2019 Ortega said in Spanish. By then, the Honduran citizen who has lived nearly three decades in the U.S. said he had already taken out his green card to avoid making any sudden moves should agents approach him.",
      "One of the agents did, and while holding a gun, demanded to see his ID, Ortega said. After he showed it, he said the agent let him go.",
      "The day laborer said he recently started carrying not only his driver's license but his green card with him.",
      "While he is not directly affected by the immigration raids, Ortega said they still weigh on him and his children.",

      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "President Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled in SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353. The money can be spent on most groceries, but Trump's administration recently approved requests by six states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 to exclude certain items, such as soda or candy.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "West Virginia newspaper executive and former House of Delegates Democratic leader Doug Skaff Jr. has died in a highway accident",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Doug Skaff Jr., a West Virginia newspaper executive and former Democratic legislative leader, died Tuesday following an accident on Interstate 79. He was 48.",
      "Skaff was president of HD Media, which publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the Herald-Dispatch of Huntington and several other state newspapers. The Gazette-Mail announced Skaff\u2019s death on its website Tuesday night.",
      "Details of the accident, which the newspaper said occurred in Lewis County in north-central West Virginia, weren\u2019t immediately released. An operator who answered the telephone for the Lewis County state police office said she had no further information.",
      "Skaff served in the supermajority-Republican state House of Delegates for nearly 11 nonconsecutive years representing Kanawha County. He resigned his seat in 2023 and switched to the GOP before a failed campaign for secretary of state in 2024.",
      "Skaff also was interim executive director of the West Virginia Press Association and recently was part of an ownership group that purchased a popular restaurant in Charleston. Skaff planned to run for state Senate next year, according to the secretary of state's website.",
      "\u201cI am heartbroken to hear about the passing of our friend Doug Skaff,\u201d Gov.

      "WASHINGTON -- Seven Army bases whose names were changed in 2023 because they honored Confederate leaders are all reverting back to their original names, the Army said Tuesday.",
      "The announcement came just hours after President Donald Trump previewed the decision, telling troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that he was changing the names back. Fort Bragg, which was changed to Fort Liberty by the Biden administration, was the first to have its original name restored after the Army found another person with the same last name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was with Trump at Fort Bragg, signed an order restoring the name in February.",
      "\u201cCan you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll forget all about that.\u201d",
      "In March, Hegseth reversed the decision changing Fort Benning in Georgia to Fort Moore.",
      "To restore the original names of the additional seven bases, the Army once again found service members with the same last names to honor. Those bases are Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Pickett and Fort Robert E. Lee in Virginia, Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.",
      "The decision strips names chosen in 2023 to honor top leaders, such as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as Black soldiers and women. No women are included in the new Army list.",
      "There was no immediate cost estimate for changing all the signs at the bases, just two years after they were revamped.",
      "Originally it was named after Confederate Gen. Ambrose P. Hill, before being renamed Fort Walker after Mary Edwards Walker, a doctor who treated soldiers in the Civil War and later received a Medal of Honor.",
      "Now it will be named to commemorate three different people: Medal of Honor recipients Lt. Col. Edward Hill, 1st Sgt. Robert A. Pinn and Pvt. Bruce Anderson for heroism during the Civil War.",
      "Fort Pickett was changed to Fort Barfoot in honor of Tech Sgt. Van Barfoot, a Medal of Honor recipient who served in World War II.",
      "It will now honor 1st Lt. Vernon W. Pickett. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during World War II when he fired grenades while pinned down by enemy machine gun fire and destroyed enemy positions. He was captured, then escaped and rejoined his unit, but was killed in action.",
      "Fort Lee was changed to a hyphenated name, Fort Gregg-Adams, and was the only one to commemorate someone who remained alive at the time \u2014 Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg. He was known as a logistics leader and died last year. Lt. Col. Charity Adams \u2014 the other half of the name \u2014 led the first female Black unit of the Army deployed in World War II.",
      "Fort Lee will now be named for Pvt. Fitz Lee, who received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the Spanish-American War, when he moved under fire to rescue wounded comrades.",
      "Fort Gordon was changed to Fort Eisenhower to commemorate the former president's time leading Allied forces in Europe in World War II.",
      "It will now be named for Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon. He was honored for his valor during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, where he defended wounded crew members at a helicopter crash site and held off an advancing enemy force.",
      "Fort Hood was changed to Fort Cavazos in honor of Gen. Richard Cavazos, the Army\u2019s first Hispanic four-star, who served in the Korean War and got the Distinguished Service Cross.",
      "It will now honor Col. Robert B. Hood. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during World War I, when he directed artillery fire in France.",
      "Fort Polk was changed to Fort Johnson after Black Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. William Henry Johnson, who served in World War I.",
      "It will now honor Silver Star recipient Gen. James H. Polk. Then-Col. Polk was honored for gallantry during World War II, when he led reconnaissance and combat missions under fire. He later served as head of U.S. Army Europe.",
      "Fort Rucker was named Fort Novosel after Medal of Honor recipient Chief Warrant Officer Michael Novosel, who served in World War II and Vietnam.",
      "It will now honor Capt. Edward W. Rucker. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in World War I when he flew deep behind enemy lines in a daring air battle over France.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites across broad landscapes, including two in California created by his predecessor at the request of Native American tribes.",
      "A Justice Department legal opinion released Tuesday disavowed a 1938 determination that monuments created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act can't be revoked. The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.",
      "The finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump weighs changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Natural Resources Committee, said that at Trump's order, \u201chis Justice Department is attempting to clear a path to erase national monuments.\"",
      "Trump in his first term reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a \u201cmassive land grab.\" He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.",
      "Former President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments.",
      "The two monuments singled out in the newly released Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.",
      "The Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border.",
      "Chuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.",
      "All but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources. About half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments.",
      "But critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.",
      "Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Satt\u00edtla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt.",
      "\"Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,\" Pettit wrote.",
      "Trump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.",
      "Environmental groups said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.",
      "\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,\u201d said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.",
      "Biden established 10 new monuments, among them the site of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, and another on a sacred Native American site near the Grand Canyon.",
      "Since 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments, according to a National Park Service database.",
      "Dwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.",
      "Trump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.",
      "The reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending.",
      "President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.",

    "summary": "Brian Wilson was one of the world's most influential recording artists.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \"Good Vibrations,\" \"California Girls\" and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died, his family said in a statement posted to his website and social media\u00a0accounts. He was 82.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\" the family said in Wednesday's statement. \"We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.\"",
      "Further details weren't immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson's longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge.",
      "The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock's great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound.",
      "\"It is indeed hard to talk about the influence of Brian Wilson just on music because he is a shaper of American myth and American culture,\" Joe Levy, a contributor to Rolling Stone and Billboard, told CBS News following the news of Wilson's death. \"Our popular ideas about California \u2014 a land of surf and sun \u2014 many of them come from Beach Boys songs.\"",
      "The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Katy Perry and Carole King. The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \"Pet Sounds\" as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \"God Only Knows\" as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears.",
      "Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \"Pet Sounds\" and his restored opus, \"Smile,\" before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go's, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart.",
      "An endless summer",
      "The Beach Boys' music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates.",
      "Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \"Surfin' USA\"; the melting vocals of \"Don't Worry Baby\"; the chants of \"fun, fun, fun\" or \"good, good, GOOD, good vibrations\"; the behind-the-wheel chorus \"'Round, 'round, get around, I get around.\" Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand.",
      "The band's innocent appeal survived the group's increasingly troubled backstory, whether Brian's many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson's ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create.",
      "From the suburbs to the national stage",
      "Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group's only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \"Surfin,'\" a minor hit released in 1961.",
      "They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \"Surfin,'\" they discovered the record label had tagged them \"The Beach Boys.\"",
      "Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band's recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer.",
      "Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \"Surfin' USA,\" so closely modeled on Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \"If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody'd be surfin,' / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\" From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and narrowly missing with \"California Girls\" and \"Fun, Fun, Fun.\" For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby.",
      "Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love's nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \"The Warmth of the Sun\" was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014   he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \"Don't Worry Baby,\" a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man's confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian's crippling anxieties.",
      "Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \"California Girls.\"",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country's answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \"art\" and leaving Wilson a broken man.",
      "The Beach Boys vs. the Beatles",
      "The Beatles opened with \"Rubber Soul,\" released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \"She Loves You\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them.",
      "Wilson worked for months on what became \"Pet Sounds,\" and months on the single \"Good Vibrations.\" He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \"I Know There's an Answer\" to \"You Still Believe in Me,\" many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \"Good Vibrations,\" a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space.",
      "The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \"Good Vibrations\" was the group's first million-seller and \"Pet Sounds,\" which included the hits \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \"concept\" album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \"Pet Sounds\" couldn't be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \"Rhapsody in Blue\" had inspired him since childhood.",
      "But the album didn't chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the Beatles' next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys' vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \"Pet Sounds.\" The Beatles' epic \"A Day in the Life\" reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album to beat.",
      "All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \"teenage symphony to God\" he called \"Smile.\" It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \"Smile,\" then canceled it.",
      "Remnants, including the songs \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Wind Chimes\" were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \"Smiley Smile,\" dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \"bunt instead of a grand slam.\" The stripped down \"Wild Honey,\" released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn't restore the band's reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical '60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.",
      "Years of struggle, and late life validation",
      "Addicted to drugs and psychologically helpless, sometimes idling in a sandbox he had built in his living room, Wilson didn't fully produce another Beach Boys record for years. Their biggest hit of the 1970s was a greatest hits album, \"Endless Summer,\" that also helped reestablish them as popular concert performers.",
      "Although well enough in the 21st century to miraculously finish \"Smile\" and tour and record again, Wilson had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and baffled interviewers with brief and disjointed answers. Among the stranger episodes of Wilson's life was his relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, a psychotherapist accused of holding a Svengali-like power over him. A 1991 lawsuit from Wilson's family blocked Landy from Wilson's personal and business affairs.",
      "His first marriage, to singer Marilyn Rovell, ended in divorce and he became estranged from daughters Carnie and Wendy, who would help form the pop trio Wilson Phillips. His life stabilized in 1995 with his marriage to Melinda Ledbetter, who gave birth to two more daughters, Daria and Delanie. He also reconciled with Carnie and Wendy and they sang together on the 1997 album \"The Wilsons.\" (Melinda Ledbetter died in 2024.)",
      "In 1992, Brian Wilson eventually won a $10 million out-of-court settlement for lost songwriting royalties. But that victory and his 1991 autobiography, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" set off other lawsuits that tore apart the musical family.",
      "Carl Wilson and other relatives believed the book was essentially Landy's version of Brian's life and questioned whether Brian had even read it. Their mother, Audree Wilson, unsuccessfully sued publisher HarperCollins because the book said she passively watched as her husband beat Brian as a child. Love successfully sued Brian Wilson, saying he was unfairly deprived of royalties after contributing lyrics to dozens of songs. He would eventually gain ownership of the band's name.",
      "The Beach Boys still released an occasional hit single: \"Kokomo,\" made without Wilson, hit No. 1 in 1988. Wilson, meanwhile, released such solo albums as \"Brian Wilson\" and \"Gettin' In Over My Head,\" with cameos by McCartney and Clapton among others. He also completed a pair of albums for the Walt Disney label \u2014 a collection of Gershwin songs and music from Disney movies. In 2012, surviving members of the Beach Boys reunited for a 50th anniversary album, which quickly hit the Top 10 before the group again bickered and separated.",
      "Wilson won two competitive Grammys, for the solo instrumental \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" and for \"The Smile Sessions\" box set. Otherwise, his honors ranged from a Grammy lifetime achievement prize to a tribute at the Kennedy Center to induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, he returned to his old high school in Hawthorne and witnessed the literal rewriting of his past: The principal erased an \"F\" he had been given in music and awarded him an \"A.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 19:57:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Weinstein was convicted of one of two counts of criminal sexual assault. The jury told the judge they hadn't reached a verdict on the third degree rape charge.",
    "story": [
      "A jury found Harvey Weinstein guilty of one count in his\u00a0sexual assault retrial\u00a0as they returned a partial verdict after days of deliberations.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faced three charges. He was accused of third-degree rape, and two counts of first-degree criminal sexual assault.",
      "The jury told the judge they found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Miriam Haley.",
      "The jury found Weinstein not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "The jury told the judge they have not reached a verdict on the charge of third degree rape involving Jessica Mann. The judge sent the jury home for the day, and told them they would continue to deliberate on that count Thursday.",
      "Jury foreperson reports alleged threat from fellow juror",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. They started deliberating on June 5. The verdict came after days of apparently tense deliberations, with jurors sending notes to the judge asking to speak with him privately. Weinstein's defense attorneys has repeatedly asked for a mistrial.",
      "Wednesday, the jury foreperson asked to speak to the judge in private, saying there was infighting going on between the jurors over the rape count, with one allegedly telling another they'd meet them outside one day as an apparent threat.",
      "According to a transcript, the foreperson said, \"Somebody talk to me, 'Oh, we will see you outside,' because I got my decision. I say, 'No, that's my personal decision. You don't have to change me.'\"",
      "That prompted the defense attorney to call for a mistrial and suggest the juror file a complaint with police.",
      "Despite all the fighting between attorneys, Weinstein himself then said, \"This isn't fair. This isn't right. I'm the one on trial. This is my life that's on the line, I am not getting a fair trial. You are endangering me.\"",
      "Weinstein's defense attorney Arthur Aidala told the judge he was disgusted by what was happening. The judge told Aidala the tension in the jury room appears to be schoolyard antics.",
      "The juror foreperson told the judge he does feel safe returning to court Thursday, but instead of going to the jury room, he will meet with a court officer and have court-appointed security.",
      "Accusers Kaja Sokola, Jessica Mann, Miriam Haley speak out",
      "Because the jury is still deliberating on the remaining count, neither the prosecutors nor defense attorneys could comment about the outcome to the press. Weinstein's publicist, however, said the split verdict is still a win.",
      "\"So today we consider this a victory, a win for us, because he beat the toughest charge, which was Kaja Sokola, which is the new charge, which meant that the clock would've had to start ticking again,\" publicist Juda Engelmayer said, \"whereas on the other two, he's already served time for them. So whatever time he might get on this, he's already served five-and-a-half, six years.\"",
      "But the lawyer for Sokola said this is a victory for all women who testified and survivors everywhere Even though Weinstein was not found guilty on her count, the lawyer said Sokola's truth was heard, and her testimony helped bring down a man who believed he was untouchable.",
      "\"I'm very happy he's convicted. That's all that matters,\" Sokola said.",
      "\"I knew how hard it is to prove reasonable doubt for a crime that happened almost 20 years ago. I made sure Kaja knew it, too, and she still stood in her truth, and history is going to remember her for that,\" attorney Lindsay Goldbrum said.",
      "\"I truly hope from the bottom of my heart that standing right here now will give courage to others to speak up, to don't suffer in silence. Because suffering and living with a trauma like this without sharing with other people is like cancer, it can eat you alive,\" Sokola said.",
      "Gloria Allred, Haley's attorney, called her client \"the real hero of this case ... because he was convicted not once but twice based on her testimony.\"",
      "\"The defense set a very disruptive and chaotic tone from the very beginning of this trial, which I suppose was meant to distract jury from undeniable facts. And I'm so grateful that they saw through the nonsense and the antics,\" Haley said.",
      "In a statement, Haley said the verdict gives her hope.",
      "\"Hope that there is a new awareness around sexual violence, and that the myth of the 'perfect victim' is fading. I hope this result empowers others to speak out and seek justice,\" she wrote, in part.",
      "Mann released a statement.",
      "\"I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone,\" Mann said in her statement. \"Coming forward cost me everything. My privacy, my safety. I laid bare my trauma, my shame \u2013 everything I'd tried to bury just to keep living. Still, I stood up and told the truth. Again and again.\"",
      "Legal expert on Wednesday's happenings",
      "\"This is really rare,\" said Rich Schoenstein, vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin. \"We're well into deliberations, and the jury essentially said we've agreed on two of the three counts. On one of the counts, we find him guilty. On another of the counts, we find him not guilty. And on the third count we haven't been able to reach a decision. And remember, each count is basically a different victim ... this is just a different decision with respect to each of three women.\"",
      "The charges against Harvey Weinstein",
      "The trial involved accusations from three women:\u00a0Haley, Mann and Sokola.",
      "Haley and Sokola both testified Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on each of them on separate occasions \u2013 Haley at Weinstein's apartment in July 2006 and Sokola at a Manhattan hotel sometime in late April or early May 2006.",
      "Mann testified Weinstein raped her at a New York hotel in 2013.",
      "All three accusers took the stand during the trial, along with Sokola's former roommate and an ex-aide who worked for Weinstein's film production company. Weinstein himself decided not to testify, his attorney said.",
      "Haley and Mann's accusations were the focus of Weinstein's original 2020 trial. Sokola came forward with her accusations as that trial was ongoing, and the related charges were added to the retrial.",
      "Harvey Weinstein trial timeline",
      "These charges date back to October 2017 when a bombshell expos\u00e9 into Weinstein's alleged misconduct was published in The New York Times, sparking the #MeToo movement.",
      "He surrendered to police in Lower Manhattan months later, in May 2018, and was arraigned on multiple sex assault charges, some of which were later tossed.",
      "As his New York trial got underway in January 2020, he was also indicted on separate sex assault charges in Los Angeles.",
      "On Feb. 24, 2020, after five days of deliberations, Weinstein was found guilty of third-degree rape and criminal sexual act. He was acquitted of three other counts, including predatory sexual assault. The following month, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "In December 2022, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of three counts of sexual assault, including rape. Two months later, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on those charges.",
      "Weinstein's 2020 conviction was overturned by the State of New York Court of Appeals in April 2024\u00a0because the judge in the original trial allowed prosecutors to call alleged victims whose accusations were not part of the charges against Weinstein.",
      "The retrial began April 23, 2025, with Weinstein facing an additional new sex crime charge. The trial lasted just over five weeks, with closing arguments given on June 3. Jury deliberations began June 5.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Tribeca Festival continues this week with movie screenings, Q&As, industry panel discussions and public performances across New York City. But one program in this year's festival takes place in virtual worlds.",
      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",
      "\"Scent,\" by Alan Kwan, is a first-person cinematic game in which the player becomes a dog wandering a landscape, who observes people being attacked and killed by malevolent forces. In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",
      "Other exhibits are immersive representations of culture \u2014 some self-generated, some created by AI.",

      "The interactive \"New Maqam City,\" by MIPSTERZ, allows you to become a DJ, manipulating drum beat patterns recognizable in Muslim communities around the world to create a transcendent vibe.",
      "\"The Innocence of Unknowing\" is a video essay and AI project studying media coverage of mass shootings, projected within a simulated classroom. (Created by Ryat Yezbick and Milo Talwani through the MIT Open Documentary Lab.)",
      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. Ironically, the creators' use of  haptic VR to demonstrate the harrowing effects of the pseudoscience of conversion therapy makes  one never want to have VR electrodes attached to your body.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",

      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He claimed he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later claimed he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "But Levi\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university. Spokespeople for the two institutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine, but little about vaccines or medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",

The next meeting of the committee is coming up at the end of June.",

      "Egg prices dropped to $4.55 in May, down 11% from $5.12 in April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price drop for a dozen Grade A large eggs comes as the effects of a years-long, widespread avian flu outbreak recede and demand for eggs eases, as it usually does this time of year.",
      "\"There are two main drivers behind the drop in prices \u2014 abatement in the conversation about bird flu, and some seasonality in uses of eggs. Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",

      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",

      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",

      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",

That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:28:35 -0400",
    "summary": "The federal government now spends more on servicing its debt than it does on defense. The GOP's new tax bill could ratchet that higher, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

      "While the announcement by Mr. Trump's top negotiators on Tuesday evening of an agreed framework was thin on details, the president\u00a0said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform Wednesday morning that it was \"done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me.\"",

      "In Geneva, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to put their unprecedented tariffs of more than 100% on each other's imports on hold for 90 days. That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports down to their current level of 30% after they briefly soared to around 145%.",

      "U.S. officials have been told Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region earlier Wednesday. The State Department ordered non-emergency government officials to exit Iraq due to \"heightened regional tensions,\" and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily leave locations throughout the Middle East, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Iran at an appearance at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, telling reporters Americans were advised to leave the region \"because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump also reiterated the U.S. did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, saying: \"We're not going to allow that.\"",
      "When asked at the White House why dependents of military personnel were allowed to voluntarily leave the region, Mr. Trump said, \"You'll have to see.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters Wednesday that if nuclear talks fail and \"a conflict is imposed on us,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"will target all U.S. bases in the host countries.\"",
      "The U.K. Maritime Trade Organization on Wednesday advised ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman \u2014 three key waterways for the global oil trade \u2014 due to \"increased tensions within the region which could lead to an escalation of military activity.\"",
      "Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought a deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear program, as international watchdogs say the country has continued to enrich uranium to near-weapons level. The talks are delicate, and it's unclear how close the two sides are to a deal: Mr. Trump has said he will not accept any uranium enrichment by Iran, but Iranian leaders have indicated they won't accept those terms, the president said earlier this week.",
      "For years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's office says Israel has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said publicly he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.",
      "\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Iran's nuclear program dates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.",
      "In 2015, former President Barack Obama struck a deal with Iran limiting the scope of the country's uranium enrichment program, over the objections of Netanyahu, who alleged Iran is unreliable and had covertly violated the agreement. Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern country expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.",
      "In a report two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated Iran had enriched 408.6 kilograms of uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 which is very close to the 90% enrichment level required to build a nuclear weapon. That's a significant jump from the 274.8-kilogram stockpile the United Nations agency had estimated in February.",
      "In testimony on Capitol Hill earlier Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, \"There are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon.\"",

    "summary": "Activist David Hogg will leave the Democratic Party's leadership, saying he will not run in a planned redo of this year's DNC vice chair elections.",
    "story": [
      "Activist David Hogg is exiting his role as Democratic National Committee vice chair, he said Wednesday, after months of controversy sparked by his plan to back primary challenges against Democrats he claims are \"asleep at the wheel.\"",
      "Hogg announced he will not run in a planned redo of this year's DNC vice chair elections, shortly after the party voted to void Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta's victories in the DNC's vice chair elections earlier this year. The revote is not related to Hogg's push to primary elected Democrats, but it came after Hogg drew stiff criticism over the plan.",
      "\"It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair \u2014 and it's okay to have disagreements. What isn't okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,\" Hogg said in a statement issued through his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve. \"Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, \"I commend David for his years of activism, organizing and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair.\"",
      "Hogg, 25, rose to fame after he survived the deadly 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and helped lead the March for Our Lives movement in support of gun control legislation. He was elected to one of the DNC's vice chair positions earlier this year.",
      "Months after taking on the role, Hogg and his group called Leaders We Deserve touted an effort to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats (not frontline districts) who are failing to meet the moment as part of a $20 million initiative to elect young leaders and bring about generational change in the Democratic Party.\"",
      "The move came as Democrats \u2014 stung by last year's presidential defeat and hobbled as the minority party in both chambers of Congress \u2014 debate how best to push back against President Trump.",
      "But Hogg's announcement was met with outcry from some Democratic heavyweights who believe party leaders should stay neutral in primaries and focus on ousting elected Republicans. Martin, who won his role the same day Hogg was elected as a vice chair, told reporters in April that \"no DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election \u2014 whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger.\"",
      "Matt Bennett, a campaign aide to former President Bill Clinton who now works for the centrist group Third Way, called it \"insane behavior from a DNC official.\"",
      "Hogg has defended the Leaders We Deserve initiative, telling CBS News' Major Garrett in April, \"We have to show our base right now that we are doing everything we can to fight back against Donald Trump, and that includes holding ourselves accountable.\"",
      "Hogg's future as a DNC vice chair has been in question for weeks as concerns about him within the party appeared to grow, and the infighting troubled an array of important people within the party.",
      "The challenge to Hogg's Feb. 1 election as a DNC vice chair, made well before the standoff between him and party officials began in April, moved forward in recent weeks as pushback and controversy enveloped the young leader just months into his tenure with the national party.",
      "The challenge from this winter, which eventually led to Wednesday's move for new elections for Hogg and fellow vice chair Kenyatta's party offices, was brought by Kalyn Free of Oklahoma, who argued she lost the vice chair race because the party didn't follow the proper rules. The complaint claimed that \"the decision to ignore the Charter, Bylaws and upend the stated Election Rules in conducting the election for the second and third Vice Chair positions gave the two male candidates an unfair and insurmountable advantage over the women candidates.\"",
      "While the election challenge was never about Hogg's controversies, the two became tied together publicly at a difficult time for the party. Reeling from losses in the 2024 presidential election and nationwide branding issues, Democrats were determined to start rebuilding. But the tensions between Hogg and party leaders loomed over that work publicly, and were used by some within the GOP to criticize the Democratic Party as the drama played out.",
      "Now, Democrats are expected to try and move past this period of intraparty fighting that has troubled them during the first year of President Trump's second term in office. Had Hogg tried to remain vice chair, he would have faced Kenyatta in a race for one vice chair role, with the loser then being eligible to run against several challengers for another vice chair slot.",
      "\"I look forward to getting back to work electing Democrats up and down the ballot,\" Kenyatta said in a statement about Wednesday's news. \"I wish David the best.\"",

    "summary": "The board that oversees prestigious Fulbright scholarships accused the Trump administration of meddling that could \"damage the integrity of this storied program.\"",
    "story": [
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships resigned Wednesday, protesting the Trump administration's alleged meddling with the selection of award recipients for the international exchange program.",
      "A statement published by the board members said the administration usurped their authority by denying awards to \"a substantial number of people\" who had already been chosen to study and teach in the U.S. and abroad. Another 1,200 foreign award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\"To continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board's request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America's credibility abroad,\" the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "Fulbright scholars include recent U.S. college graduates who pursue further study or teach English overseas, American professors who spend a year at a university in another country and international scholars who come to the U.S. to study or work at universities here. Alumni have gone on to serve as heads of state and have received Nobel and Pulitzer prizes.",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department and other countries' embassies. The board \u2014 whose members are selected by the president \u2014 has had final approval. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, agriculture, music, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "All the board members who resigned were selected under former President Joe Biden. The State Department, which runs the scholarship program, said they were partisan political appointees.",
      "\"The 12 members of the Fulbright Board were partisan political appointees of the Biden Administration. It's ridiculous to believe that these members would continue to have final say over the application process, especially when it comes to determining academic suitability and alignment with President Trump's Executive Orders. The claim that the Fulbright Hayes Act affords exclusive and final say over Fulbright Applications to the Fulbright board is false. This is nothing but a political stunt attempting to undermine President Trump,\" a senior State Department official told CBS News.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermines the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\"We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\" the statement said. \"It is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration's efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation's most respected and valuable programs.\"",
      "The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on international students in recent weeks. The State Department\u00a0halted all new student visa interviews late last month, in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also tried to block virtually all international students from traveling to the U.S. to attend Harvard University amid a feud with the Ivy League school, leading a federal judge to issue a restraining order. And anybody who wants to travel to Harvard from abroad \u2014 including students, faculty, guest speakers and tourists \u2014 is subject to \"additional vetting,\" according to a State Department email obtained by CBS News.",
      "International students who have already been granted visas could also face extra scrutiny. The administration\u00a0says it will \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of some Chinese students, and authorities have sought to rescind thousands of other students' legal status, though a judge blocked that practice.",

During major disasters, it serves as a 24/7 emergency operations hub, hosting experts from different federal agencies, the military and even nonprofits. When a major hurricane, wildfire or other crisis hits, the NRCC helps coordinate everything from getting rescue teams on the ground to dispatching food, water and medical supplies to disaster zones.",

      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",

      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

    "story": [
      "A war of words is escalating between Senate Democrats and executives at the crypto firm that is partly owned by President Trump's family, as congressional leaders seek more information about ways in which the first family may be seeking to blend profit with official government action, CBS News has learned.",
      "In an exchange of polite but pointed letters, Senate Democrats demanded more details about a multibillion-dollar transaction between the Trump family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, and a pool of investors that includes foreign nationals. And the senators questioned the firm on its launch of a \"stablecoin,\" a crypto product backed directly by U.S. currency.",
      "\"The launch of a stablecoin directly tied to a sitting President who stands to benefit financially from the stablecoin's success is an unprecedented conflict of interest presenting significant threats to both our financial system and our democracy,\" Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon write in the June 10 letter.",
      "The increased attention comes as the Senate is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, which would adopt a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins, which are pegged to a certain value \u2014 typically the U.S. dollar \u2014 are designed to be less volatile than other crypto products. This makes it an attractive asset for users who want to move between cryptocurrencies more efficiently.",
      "Warren and Merkley requested financial records related to the $2 billion investment in World Liberty made by MGX, an Emirati firm, and the involvement in the business deal by Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, controlled by a Singaporian national.",
      "The letter is addressed to the CEOs of Binance and MGX, and it asks these firms to preserve communications between Binance officials, MGX, World Liberty Financial, the White House and other U.S. federal government agencies. It also requests communications between specific individuals including President Trump, his sons Barron, Eric and Donald Jr.; Zack and Alex Witkoff, co-founders of World Liberty Financial, and their father Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "The senators' request is in response to a letter sent by World Liberty on May 29, in which the company's lawyers dispute allegations that MGX's $2 billion investment into Binance through World Liberty Financial improperly benefits the Trump family.",
      "\"What the Company rejects is the suggestion that legitimate financial innovation\u2014especially innovation that strengthens U.S. competitiveness\u2014should be treated with suspicion simply because it succeeds,\" says the letter from World Liberty's lawyers, reviewed by CBS News.",
      "CBS News reached out to the White House for comment about potential conflict of interest but did not hear back at the time of publication.",
      "Trump family's business interests in crypto",
      "In the last six months, the Trump family has rolled out a series of announcements related to its business interests in crypto.",
      "In the fall of 2024, the Trumps announced World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange that says on its website it was \"inspired\" by Mr. Trump, who is listed as \"chief Crypto Advocate,\" while his three sons are listed as \"Web3 Ambassadors.\"",
      "Months later, they announced both the $TRUMP coin and $MELANIA coin, crypto tokens known as \"meme coins,\" whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. This type of cryptocurrency is not usually used in transactions and is known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025 before rebounding a bit to about $11.",
      "Both crypto ventures have been financially beneficial to the president's family, which receives a share of transaction fees, regardless of how the currency is valued.",
      "The fine print on the World Liberty Financial's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company. According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity \"DT Marks DEFI LLC\" also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.",
      "On May 23, the president hosted a gala dinner\u00a0for the top holders of his $TRUMP coin, where attendees spent an average of $1 million a person to mingle with Mr. Trump at his Virginia golf course. Data from analytics firm Chainalysis shows that entities connected to Mr. Trump and other backers collected more than $300 million in transaction fees related to $TRUMP coin in the lead-up to the dinner.",
      "In April, World Liberty Financial launched a new stablecoin product called \"USD1,\" which is backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. MGX agreed to purchase $2 billion worth of this currency to finance a deal with Binance.",
      "\"Why \u2014 beyond the obvious benefit of gaining favor, directly or indirectly, with the Trump Administration \u2014 did you select USD1, a newly-launched, untested cryptocurrency with a no track record?\" Senators Warren and Merkley ask in their letter to the MGX and Binance CEOs.",
      "World Liberty Financial has maintained that stablecoins, including their USD1 product, help bolster the strength of the dollar.",
      "\"[USD1] is a stablecoin designed to assist in modernizing global access to the U.S. dollar and to enhance American monetary leadership by helping preserve the U.S. dollar's role as the world's reserve currency at a time when rival currencies and closed financial systems are gaining ground,\" the company said in its May 29 letter.",
      "The company's letter states that if the MGX deal had not been conducted in USD1, it would have been settled in a foreign currency, most likely UAE dirhams. Instead, it argues, keeping transactions in USD1 reinforces demand for the dollar.",
      "\"Absent USD1, that capital would have exited the U.S. financial sphere entirely and moved offshore,\" says the letter.",
      "But Warren and Merkley say the deal raises questions about potential efforts to curry favor with the president's family.",
      "The Senate is set to vote on the GENIUS Act today. If adopted, it would allow the federal government to issue licenses for stablecoin issuers and require those products to be backed by U.S. dollars or other cash equivalents.",
      "Supporters of the bill say it's a critical moment to introduce federal regulation over an increasingly popular investment tool.",
      "But critics like Warren say the bill does not go far enough to strengthen oversight over an industry that the president's family benefits from directly.",
      "\"A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President's corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.\" she said in a Senate floor debate on May 19.",
      "In May, Senate Democrats pushed to include an amendment that would specifically prevent a sitting president and his family from making money from stablecoin products. Ultimately, this amendment was not included and the bill advanced by a vote of 66 in favor and 22 opposed, with 16 Democrats joining Republicans to support it.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:28:03 -0400",
    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "summary": "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
    "story": [
      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "In addition to new design elements detailed below, iOS 26 will elevate the capabilities of existing apps including Facetime, Photos, Safari and Carplay.",
      "There's also a splashy update to iPhone photo display: With iOS 26, users will\u00a0 be able to view pictures in 3D across the Photos app, lock screen and home screen.",
      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",
      "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

    "summary": "We asked three experts what fresh college graduates can do to prepare as artificial intelligence changes how Americans work. Here's what they said.",
    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",

    "summary": "Children's deaths by gun-related homicide and suicide rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws following a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, a new study found.",
    "story": [
      "Gun deaths among children have risen over a 13-year period in states with lax firearm laws, according to a new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho and Georgia were among the states that saw a jump in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearms restrictions following a 2010\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0ruling that applied the Second Amendment to the states, researchers found.",
      "Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Brigham Hospital and the study's lead author, said he started the research after wondering why gun deaths among children were so high. Firearms are the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the United States, with a\u00a0steep increase\u00a0in ages 15 to 19 starting in 2020.",
      "\"Why did things go so badly in some states?\" Faust asked. He said legal scholars told him to look at\u00a0McDonald v. City of Chicago, which applied the Second Amendment to local jurisdictions.",
      "The Supreme Court held in the landmark case that the Constitution's Second Amendment restrains the government's ability to significantly limit \"the right to keep and bear arms.\" For the first decade of the 21st century, there were very few changes to gun laws but every state changed their laws to some or great extent after McDonald, said Faust.",
      "Researchers divided the 50 states into three groups \u2014 most permissive, permissive, and strict \u2014 based on legal changes made since 2010. The team, which included researchers from Brown University, Yale New Haven, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, used a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database to analyze data from the decade before the Supreme Court ruling and then compared that to data from 2011 to 2023.",
      "The findings surprised Faust and his team, he told CBS News.",
      "Youth deaths jumped by 7,398 in the period after the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 with a total of 23,000 gun-related fatalities. Children's deaths by both homicide and suicide also rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws, the study found. Black youth also saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the most permissive and permissive states.",

    "story": [
      "The head of FEMA's National Response Coordination Center \u2014 a position responsible for the government's response to storms \u2014 submitted his resignation letter Wednesday and will formally depart the agency in two weeks.",
      "Jeremy Greenberg's planned departure comes less than two weeks into hurricane season and amid a major leadership exodus at the nation's disaster response and recovery agency.",
      "Greenberg confirmed his departure to CBS News but deferred all comment to FEMA, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, also did not immediately respond.",
      "The National Response Coordination Center is the nerve center for FEMA during emergencies. During major disasters, it serves as a 24/7 emergency operations hub, hosting experts from different federal agencies, the military and even nonprofits. When a major hurricane, wildfire or other crisis hits, the NRCC helps coordinate everything from getting rescue teams on the ground to dispatching food, water and medical supplies to disaster zones.",
      "Among his many responsibilities, Greenberg oversaw and approved mission assignments to the Pentagon amid major disasters and was responsible for deploying FEMA's 28 Urban Search and Rescue Teams.",
      "\"This will be a significant loss. He led all of FEMA's planners that prepared for all hazards,\" a former FEMA senior official told CBS News. \"He had strong interagency relationship that fostered collaboration and coordination in responding to disasters.\"",
      "One current FEMA official told CBS News, \"He's irreplaceable. The brain drain continues and the public will pay for it. I don't see how FEMA will find someone who can coordinate with national, state and local emergency organizations like he did.\"",
      "Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6 has also announced his intention to depart the agency this week, sources told CBS News. Robinson began his career with FEMA as an intern in 1987 and has led Region 6, which oversees several disaster-prone states in the Gulf, including Louisiana and Texas, for the past dozen years.",
      "He led FEMA's response and recovery efforts for several notable disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Isaac, Ike, Gustav, Rita and Katrina. Robinson will also depart the agency by the end of June, the sources said. Robinson's departure follows the resignation of his deputy, Tracy Brasher, just last week, according to the sources.",
      "Sources tell CBS News all three leaders are among the most experienced career staffers at the agency.",
      "\"These leaders don't want to participate in the dismantling of the agency they value,\" the former senior FEMA official said. \"They have been dedicated to the mission over multiple administrations but won't support the current administration's direction.\"",
      "President Trump said Tuesday that his administration wants to \"wean\" states off assistance from FEMA after this year's hurricane season. The president's remarks came after he received a briefing from top administration officials about wildfire and emergency management. He claimed that FEMA has not been successful, and said governors are better positioned to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes.",
      "\"We want to wean off FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level \u2014 a little bit like education, we're moving it back to the states,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Earlier this month, newly minted acting FEMA administrator David Richardson said during a daily briefing that he had not been aware that the U.S. has a hurricane season, three sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News. Richardson's remark left FEMA employees confused, as they were unclear as to whether he made the comment as a joke, CBS News reported last week. DHS later insisted he was joking.",

      "President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, two U.S. officials said.",

      "When asked at the White House why dependents of military personnel were allowed to voluntarily leave the region, Mr. Trump said, \"You'll have to see.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters Wednesday that if nuclear talks fail and \"a conflict is imposed on us,\" the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"will target all U.S. bases in the host countries.\"",

The talks are delicate, and it's unclear how close the two sides are to a deal: Mr. Trump has said he will not accept any uranium enrichment by Iran, but Iranian leaders have indicated they won't accept those terms, the president said earlier this week.",
      "For years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been deeply skeptical of any deal with Iran. The two countries have been nemeses since Iran's 1979 revolution. Netanyahu's office says Israel has conducted \"countless overt and covert operations\" to stunt the growth of Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said publicly he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.",
      "\"I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Iran's nuclear program dates back decades, though the country has long insisted the program is only intended for peaceful purposes.",
      "In 2015, former President Barack Obama struck a deal with Iran limiting the scope of the country's uranium enrichment program, over the objections of Netanyahu, who alleged Iran is unreliable and had covertly violated the agreement. Mr. Trump exited the agreement during his first term and ratcheted up sanctions against Iran, while the Middle Eastern country expanded its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.",
      "In a report two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated Iran had enriched 408.6 kilograms of uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 which is very close to the 90% enrichment level required to build a nuclear weapon. That's a significant jump from the 274.8-kilogram stockpile the United Nations agency had estimated in February.",

      "His ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors that there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that the Bad Boy Records founder still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",

      "\"Jane Doe commented on the consistency between her experience and that of Cassie Ventura after she read Ventura\u2019s civil lawsuit,\" Beidel said. \"If the jury also finds the two women\u2019s experiences similar, Jane Doe\u2019s testimony becomes powerful corroboration of Ventura\u2019s testimony. Adding in the voice memos could lend even more credence to the two women\u2019s accounts, as those voice memos are evidence of Mr. Combs\u2019 views at the time in his own words.\"",
      "Jane told the court that Diddy asked her about coercion after he allegedly forced her to take drugs before having sex with a male escort. She testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior and said he once put her in a chokehold after kicking and punching her. The jury was shown video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead.",
      "Texts shown in federal court on Monday between Diddy and Jane revealed that she felt manipulated and wanted monetary income.",
      "The rapper allegedly texted Jane back, \"F--- you.\" Jane allegedly told Diddy, \"You're the only opportunist ... you had three years of fun with my body ... you were a full time job and consumed my life.\" The \"Last Night\" rapper allegedly texted back that he was blocking Jane's number and also calling the police.",

      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname \"Jane.\" (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Early in the trial, the prosecutors introduced extensive evidence to support their theory that Combs used violence and threats of violence to coerce Ventura into engaging in sexual activity,\" former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital. \"However, the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Jane Doe\u2019s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence.\u00a0That could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane\u2019s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate.\"",
      "Mark Chuktow, who now practices at Dykema, added, \"As a result, it might dilute the impact of Ventura\u2019s earlier testimony because Jane\u2019s evidence is less clear-cut regarding whether Combs coerced her to engage in sexual activity.\u00a0To counter this, the prosecutors might put more weight in closing arguments on the evidence that Combs blackmailed both women into complying with his sexual demands through threats of destroying their reputations and careers by publicly exposing the video recordings of their participation in the freak-offs.",

However, they are unlikely to be shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony given what everyone else has said thus far.",

      "\"When ICE agents called for police support when they were being assaulted, they hunkered down and waited two hours before police responded because police couldn't get authority to react.

      "The American Bar Association asked the Department of Justice on Tuesday to reconsider its historic decision to shut the organization out of the judicial nomination process and insisted it rates potential judges fairly.",
      "ABA President William Bay wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi that he was \"surprised and disappointed\" by her decision, which Bondi revealed in a letter two weeks ago.",
      "\"It is deeply disturbing that the Justice Department has decided to restrict access to judicial nominees without justification or basis,\" Bay wrote.",
      "Bondi accused the ABA, which comprises hundreds of thousands of lawyers and other legal professionals, of favoring Democratic administrations\u2019 nominees and refusing to \"fix the bias in its ratings.\"",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks at a news conference at the Justice Department, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)",
      "The ABA has for seven decades been involved in rating presidents' nominees to serve as judges in the district and appellate courts and the Supreme Court.",
      "An ABA committee rates potential judges as \"well qualified,\" \"qualified\" or \"not qualified\" based on their experience level, legal writings, and dozens of interviews with the candidates\u2019 colleagues and peers.",
      "Bay noted the ABA rated all three of President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees as \"well qualified\" and that it has given \"well qualified\" or \"qualified\" ratings to at least 97% of rated nominees for the last two decades.",
      "The ABA has also received nonpublic information about nominees, including their bar records, through DOJ waivers. Bondi said the department will no longer provide those.",

      "Bay\u2019s remarks were the latest development in a protracted legal fight that Trump and Republicans have waged against the ABA and big law over allegations they are plagued by bias. The ABA has on occasion promoted liberal initiatives, including abortion access, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the LGBTQ agenda. Bay said the rating committee is walled off from the rest of the organization.",
      "\"The Standing Committee\u2019s work is insulated from all other activities of the ABA to ensure its independence and impartiality,\" Bay wrote.",
      "Presidents nominate federal judges, and the Senate votes on them. The judges, once confirmed, serve lifetime appointments.",
      "Presidents and the Senate have for decades included the ABA in the nomination process, but Trump and President George W. Bush declined to give the ABA a first look at potential nominees before announcing them.",
      "Former President Joe Biden continued Trump\u2019s practice but clarified that he valued the ABA\u2019s ratings and only gave it post-nomination access to nominee information to save time.",

      "A DOJ spokesman said in response to Bay\u2019s letter: \"It\u2019s clear that the American Bar Association has lost its way and no longer treats all nominees in a fair and impartial manner.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who leads the Senate panel tasked with vetting potential judges, said in response to Bondi\u2019s decision that it was \"hardly surprising\" and that the legal organization has \"consistently taken partisan stances on political issues.\" Grassley noted the ABA could still weigh in on nominees independently of the administration.",
      "\"The Judiciary Committee will still accept letters from the ABA, the same as we do for all outside organizations, but it doesn\u2019t make sense for this administration to be giving favored access to an organization that\u2019s consistently shown political bias,\" Grassley said.",
      "Grassley's Democratic counterpart, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said in a statement online that the ABA's ratings process was objective.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The Trump Administration is clearly just trying to cover for unqualified and extreme nominees,\" Durbin said.",
      "Among those once rated as \"not qualified\" by the ABA was DOJ chief of staff Chad Mizelle's wife, Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who serves as a federal judge in Florida. The rating was due to her lack of experience, as the ABA's criteria for federal judges includes 12 years of experience practicing law.",
      "The ABA had mixed reviews for Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991, ultimately giving him its mid-level \"qualified\" rating.",

      "One of the most noticeable changes this year is Apple\u2019s decision to unify the naming across all its platforms. Instead of traditional version numbers, Apple is now using the year after release as the version name. So the new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "How to tell if your iPad has been hacked",
      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.",

      "Top tips to protect your iPad from hackers and malware",
      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",

      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",

It can be tricky to tell the difference.",

      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "DON'T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How to tell if a login alert is real or fake",
      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",

      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

    "summary": "E-BAR, MIT&apos;s mobile robot, provides physical support for seniors with handlebars that follow from behind, helping prevent falls while maintaining dignity for aging adults.",
    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "An individual demonstrating the E-BAR. (MIT)",
      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices. As the technology improves, it could change the way we think about caring for older adults, making everyday life safer and a bit easier for everyone involved.",

      "In the interviews with Fox News Digital, Iranians expressed deep skepticism that Khamenei would abide by any agreement. \"He lies,\" the journalist said bluntly. \"What he says publicly is never what he actually does. He manipulates both the public and foreign governments. No one should trust a dictator like him.\"",
      "The man echoed the sentiment. \"The regime's survival depends on its hostility toward the U.S. and Israel. If it truly committed to a deal, it would undermine its own ideological foundation. That\u2019s why no one believes it can last.\"",
      "Recent months have seen a resurgence of protest activity in Iran, including a growing nationwide strike by truck drivers demanding fair wages and lower fuel prices. Though largely ignored by international media, these strikes follow years of widespread protests\u2014most notably the 2022 \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" uprising sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in morality police custody.",
      "That movement, along with economic demonstrations in 2019 and 2021, was met with violent crackdowns, mass arrests, and internet blackouts. The pattern has left Iranians wary that any sign of instability is met with brutal suppression.",

Another, Daniel \u201cD.J.\u201d Rodriguez, drove a stun gun into the neck of a Capitol Police officer and pleaded guilty to the crime. And a third, Julian Khater, pepper-sprayed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick in the face. Sicknick later died.",

      "Trump\u2019s tolerance for violence against law enforcement during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is facing renewed scrutiny in the wake of his remarks and actions in Los Angeles, where his administration is taking a hard line against protesters. He federalized thousands of National Guard members and sent 700 U.S. Marines to the country\u2019s second-largest city \u2014 against the wishes of state and local officials \u2014 after protesters blocked immigration enforcement actions.",
      "It\u2019s a sea change from how Trump treated the Jan. 6 riot, when his supporters attacked the Capitol in an attempt to block Congress\u2019 certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Department officials say troops who cheered and jeered Tuesday at President Donald Trump\u2019s political statements at a rally at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, did not violate military regulations, but a former military legal officer said they did just that.",
      "During the speech, uniformed soldiers yelled in support of Trump\u2019s political statements and booed former President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "\u201cDo you think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said to boos about Biden.",
      "Trump made other comments about Newsom and about Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, where protests against the administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants have been taking place and where Trump has ordered thousands of National Guard members and active-duty Marines deployed in response. Other Trump comments about the \u201cfake news media,\u201d transgender people, protesters in California and flag-burning also drew boos from the uniformed military members in attendance.",
      "Trump is known for his rallies at which he goes after and pokes fun at political enemies and other issues, but typically he makes those remarks at political events, not on U.S. military bases.",
      "Such overt political activity on a base is the prerogative of the commander in chief. But military leaders would typically frown upon troops\u2019 reacting the way they did as inconsistent with military good order and discipline, and, according to one expert, it is a violation of military regulations found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.",
      "Presidents of both parties often use troops as political props and put them and their commanders in difficult positions by doing so, but Trump\u2019s speech took that to a new level, said Geoffrey DeWeese, a retired judge advocate general who is now an attorney with Mark S. Zaid PC. (Zaid has represented whistleblowers on both sides of the aisle, including one who filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment, and he was one of the people whose security clearances Trump revoked this year.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad tradition to use the military as a backdrop for political purposes,\u201d DeWeese said. \u201cTo actively attack another president or a sitting governor and incite the crowd to boo, that\u2019s a step in a dangerous direction, that really says we want to politicize the military, that sends a bad message.\u201d",
      "DeWeese said there were likely to have been violations of the UCMJ.",
      "\u201cI would be cringing if I was a senior officer and it happened under my watch,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly that he wants to take politics out of the military by removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning service by transgender service members.",
      "Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who worked at the State Department and the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and at the Pentagon under former President George H.W. Bush, said in an email that commanders at Fort Bragg should have done a better job preparing troops there.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s predictably bad behavior by the President to try and score political points in a military setting, and it\u2019s a command failure by leaders at Ft Bragg not to prepare soldiers for that bad behavior and counsel them not to participate.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon said in a statement that there had been no violation of the UCMJ and suggested the media was against policies that Trump has championed.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell also alleged in a statement that the media \u201ccheered on the Biden administration\u201d and its policies regarding the Defense Department \u201cwhen they forced drag queen performances on military bases, promoted service members on the basis of race and sex in violation of federal law, and fired troops who refused an experimental vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cBelieve me, no one needs to be encouraged to boo the media,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cLook no further than this query, which is nothing more than a disgraceful attempt to ruin the lives of young soldiers.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Army officials at Fort Bragg addressed the sale of some MAGA merchandise at the event, which was planned in cooperation with a nonpartisan organization, American 250.",
      "\u201cThe Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,\u201d Col. Mary Ricks, a spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s 18th Airborne Corps at Bragg, said in a statement. \u201cThe Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents. The vendor\u2019s presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar circumstances in the future.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A recent memo to immigration judges obtained by NBC News provides fresh insight into how the Trump administration is pulling off a new tactic \u2014 dismissing pending immigration cases, then immediately moving to arrest the immigrants \u2014 that is part of its bid to quickly increase the number of immigrants it is detaining.",
      "In the memo, the Justice Department instructs immigration judges, who report to the executive branch and are not part of the independent judiciary, to allow Department of Homeland Security lawyers to make motions to dismiss orally and then move quickly to grant those dismissals, rather than allow immigrants the 10-day response time that had been typical.",
      "\u201cOral Decisions must be completed within the same hearing slot on the day testimony and arguments are concluded,\u201d says the memo, which is dated May 30. It also tells the judges that \u201c[n]o additional documentation or briefing is required\u201d to grant the dismissals.",
      "Once their cases are dismissed, the immigrants in question may be put in expedited removal proceedings, which means they can be deported without a chance to make their cases for asylum before immigration judges. The memo notes that people in expedited removal proceedings \u201care subject to mandatory detention\u201d and can be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under DHS.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A source close to the immigration judges\u2019 union said that the move is legal but that it is still upsetting to many immigration judges.",
      "\u201cThey think it makes a mockery of the whole process and that it flies in the face of what Trump ran on. Immigration enforcement means it\u2019s done in a fair manner ... and this isn\u2019t fair,\u201d the source close to the union said. Immigration judges are not authorized to speak to the media except through their union.",
      "The memo cites a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that sets out the conditions under which the government can move to dismiss an immigrant\u2019s case. But it misstates the statute. The memo says, without quotation marks, that judges may grant motions to dismiss when \u201ccircumstances have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d But the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s wording is more specific; it states that cases can be dismissed when \u201ccircumstances of the case have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d",
      "Greg Chen, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he believes the new guidance violates that provision of the Immigration Nationality Act and is not legal.",
      "\u201cThe omission of the words \u2018of the case\u2019 is deliberate because DHS is trying to avoid having to speak to the individual case. The law requires them to provide particular reasons for their motion, and they are not doing that. The email is the written policy that contradicts the law,\u201d Chen said.",
      "Jason Houser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration, said dismissing cases that way will allow ICE to arrest more people but will not really help it speed up deportations because it lacks enough space to detain those arrested before deportation.",
      "The tactic of dismissing cases and then arresting people whose cases were dismissed \u201ctargets vetted migrants who were working and had legal status,\u201d he said. \u201cFlooding the system with thousands of noncriminals wastes time and resources when federal law enforcement should be focused on national security threats.\u201d",
      "As the agency steps up arrests, it faces an overcrowding issue. More than 51,000 immigrants were in ICE custody as of May 23, according to ICE data, though it is funded to hold only 41,500. Former ICE officials have said the agency can run over that allotment by only so much, and then only for a short amount of time, before it risks budget shortfalls and possible penalties from courts for living conditions that fall below court-mandated standards."

      "Rubio has cited an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s removal from the United States, saying he poses a national security risk.

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The new executive chairman for the controversial American-backed humanitarian organization distributing aid in the Gaza Strip refused to reveal the donors who are financing the agency, though he did tell NBC News that to his knowledge the group is not funded by the Israeli government.",
      "Johnnie Moore, an evangelical Christian and former PR consultant who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, was appointed executive chairman of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) last week as the organization reeled from the resignation of his predecessor. It has also faced criticism from the United Nations and aid groups for a lack of independence from Israel, which backs the organization along with the U.S.",
      "Since it started operating late last month, the group has set up aid distribution sites in Gaza in response to international pressure over serious malnutrition in Gaza, where Israel recently lifted an 11-week complete blockade on food, aid and medical supplies entering the enclave.",
      "But regular bouts of deadly violence in and around those sites has also brought increasing scrutiny on the GHF\u2019s source of funding and the degree of autonomy it has from Israel.",
      "In an exclusive interview last week, Moore said it was \u201ca private foundation.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans.\u201d",
      "Pressed on accusations that Israel was financing and controlling the organization, Moore said that \u201cbased upon what I know, this is an independent initiative that is not funded by the Israeli government.\u201d",
      "Other questions have also swirled around the GHF, even before it launched four aid distribution points in southern and central Gaza.",
      "A day before it began operations in the strip, Moore\u2019s predecessor Jake Wood resigned, saying in a letter published by Reuters that continuing to work with the group would compromise his \u201cneutrality, impartiality and independence.\u201d",
      "United Nations agencies and major aid groups that previously ran hundreds of community kitchens and bakeries in the enclave have also refused to cooperate with it, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid, forces widespread displacement in Gaza, and concentrates distribution in areas that may not be accessible to everyone.",
      "Setting up so few sites for food distribution meant crowd control problems were inevitable, according to Ciaran Donnelly, the senior vice president for international programs at the International Rescue Committee, which ran major relief operations in Gaza. \u201cNo aid organization would recommend doing it that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Inside Israel, as well, critics have questioned its independence. Last month in front of Israel\u2019s legislature, opposition leader Yair Lapid, without providing evidence, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of funding the GHF through foreign shell companies. And last week, citing unnamed public officials, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Israeli government had sent hundreds of millions of shekels to the group.",
      "Israel\u2019s government has repeatedly denied it funds the GHF.",
      "Any organization \u201cbeing used by occupying powers\u201d would not be able to carry out its task according to the humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence, said Philip Grant, the executive director of TRIAL International, a Geneva-based nongovernmental organization that advocates for victims of war crimes.",
      "TRIAL International has called on the Swiss government to investigate GHF, whose only registered presence outside the U.S. is in Geneva.",
      "While the GHF has said it is working to open new sites, including in northern Gaza, no such distribution points have opened yet, forcing some Palestinians with advanced injuries and disabilities to walk long distances for aid \u2014 often through dangerous areas and extreme heat.",
      "Such onerous requirements for something as basic as food could amount to war crimes, Grant said, and could even lead to accusations that organizations like GHF are complicit.",
      "\u201cThis operation comes with a huge risk in terms of violations of the Geneva Conventions,\u201d Grant said. \u201cEspecially the forced displacement of populations, which, if carried out, would be a participation in the war crime of enforced displacement of civilian population.\u201d"

      "The images, taken by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft and released Wednesday by the European Space Agency, offer fresh insights into the sun\u2019s behavior, its magnetic field and how it produces space weather.",
      "\u201cThe sun is our nearest star, giver of life and potential disruptor of modern space and ground power systems, so it is imperative that we understand how it works and learn to predict its behaviour,\u201d Carole Mundell, director of science at the European Space Agency (ESA), said in a statement. \u201cThese new unique views from our Solar Orbiter mission are the beginning of a new era of solar science.\u201d",
      "The images have already been a boon for heliophysicists, showing turbulent magnetic activity at the south pole as the sun ramps up to the most active phase of its natural cycle.",
      "The solar cycle typically spans about 11 years, with the sun going from a quiet period of low magnetic activity to a highly active phase characterized by intense solar flares and solar storms. As the sun reaches peak activity \u2014 a phase known as the solar maximum \u2014 its magnetic poles flip, meaning the sun\u2019s south pole becomes magnetic north.",
      "Why exactly that happens is unclear, as are precise forecasts for when it will occur. Solar Orbiter may be able to tease out some of these answers."

    "story": [
      "It wasn\u2019t exactly the verdict that Harvey Weinstein accuser Kaja Sokola had hoped for, but it was the verdict she said women determined to fight against sexual predators needed.",
      "Sokola, a former runway model from Poland, was one of three women who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them more than a decade ago.",
      "On Wednesday, a Manhattan jury found Weinstein guilty of assaulting former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley but not her. And it deadlocked on a third-degree rape charge against Weinstein in the alleged sexual assault of former actor Jessica Mann.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for me,\u201d Sokola told NBC News shortly after the verdict was announced. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change that much the most important thing, that he\u2019s convicted.\u201d",
      "What does it mean for the #MeToo movement, which was galvanized in 2020 by Weinstein\u2019s landmark conviction for sexually abusing young women?",
      "\u201cI think it sends the message that we still have some work to do,\u201d said Sokola, 39.",
      "Sokola also said she doesn\u2019t want what happened to her in court to deter other sex assault victims from coming forward.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no win or lose for me. I was not the one who was on the trial,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would not want these kind of decisions to discourage others from speaking their truth or from participating in proceedings like this, because we have one life to live, and if we won\u2019t fight for our own justice, then who will?\u201d",
      "Sokola\u2019s attorney, Lindsay Goldbrum, a partner at Goddard Law PLLC, said she and her client were prepared for the outcome.",
      "\u201cWe are in a different culture than we were five years ago when this trial first happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as a former prosecutor, I knew from the beginning that it was going to be an uphill battle for the prosecutors to be able to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt about a crime that occurred almost 20 years ago.\u201d",
      "Sokola wasn\u2019t among the women who testified against Weinstein at his first trial, in which he was convicted of third-degree rape of Mann in 2013. He was also convicted of first-degree criminal sexual act for forcibly performing oral sex on Haley in 2006.",
      "The convictions were overturned after an appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case.",
      "Sokola was added to the case after she filed her own lawsuit against Weinstein in December 2019 under New York\u2019s Child Victims Act.",
      "On the stand, Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel in 2006, when she was 19 years old. The alleged abuse first began in 2002, when she was 16, and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.",
      "\u201cI know what he did to me when I was 16, when I was 19, and nothing will change that,\u201d Sokola told NBC News.",
      "Sokola\u2019s testimony may have been undermined by her estranged older sister, Ewa Sokola, who had been subpoenaed as a prosecution witness. She testified that Sokola seemed \u201cextremely tense\u201d after a 2006 post-lunch meeting with Weinstein but didn\u2019t say she had been assaulted.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d Ewa Sokola testified.",
      "Asked about that testimony, Sokola said, \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think she does, or she should have,\u201d she said of her sister.",
      "Sokola said she has never spoken with Haley and has talked to Mann just once, about two years ago.",
      "Initially, Sokola was part of a group of women who filed a class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and his companies, alleging he had sexually abused them. At first, she hid her identity behind a pseudonym.",
      "Unhappy with a proposed deal under which almost all the civil cases against Weinstein would be settled for $47 million and he would not have to admit to wrongdoing, Sokola unmasked herself in December 2019 when she filed her lawsuit.",
      "In the suit, Sokola said she was 16 in 2002 when she had just moved from Warsaw to New York City and was first introduced to Weinstein. She said that when he learned she wanted to become an actor, he told her he could help her career.",
      "Three days later, the complaint said, Weinstein picked Sokola up for what was supposed to be a business lunch and instead took her his Manhattan apartment and demanded sex.",
      "When a weeping Sokola tried to resist, Weinstein told her he had \u201cmade\u201d the careers of the actors Penelope Cruz and Gwyneth Paltrow and warned the teenager that she \u201cwould never work as an actress unless she acquiesced to his demands,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Sokola said at Weinstein\u2019s retrial that he demanded that she masturbate him while he touched her.",
      "Sokola, 39, became one of three women who accused Weinstein of sex assault at his retrial after she told prosecutors he had also forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "That allegation of assault mirrored the testimony of Haley, who accused Weinstein of doing the same to her in 2006 when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",
      "Weinstein, who was hit with an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act, denied assaulting Sokola. He also denied assaulting Mann and Haley.",
      "Weinstein spokesman Juda Engelmayer said that \u201cwe consider this a little bit of a victory\u201d because Weinstein was acquitted on the Sokola charge.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s feeling, you know, not good about being convicted for Miriam but relieved that he wasn\u2019t convicted on Kaja and hopeful on the Jessica part,\u201d Engelmayer said of Weinstein at a news conference.",
      "Sokola is getting back to the dreams she says Weinstein stole from her after the alleged assaults, with the launch of her own production company, Falcon 88.",
      "\u201cHealing means doing what I love and being able to be a helpful member of society, being a producer that listens to others, respects others, treats people with dignity that they deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s named after my dad. He was 88 years old when he died.\u201d",
      "Her first project is executive producing a film, \u201cThe Eden Express,\u201d starring Jonah Hauer-King and David Duchovny.",
      "Sokola is also a single mom with a young son. And when she was asked how she hopes her son will react when he finds out she testified against Weinstein, she smiled.",
      "\u201cI hope he will think that his mom is a badass and that his mom stands for the truth and is not afraid to speak her truth,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "The Indiana Pacers didn't need one of their signature improbable comebacks to win Game 3 of the NBA Finals. And because of it, the Oklahoma City Thunder, once the heavy favorite to claim the league championship, will now need a rally of their own to keep their title hopes alive.",
      "During a bravura fourth quarter Wednesday in Indianapolis, the Pacers unleashed their best defense of the series and hustle on offense to force Oklahoma City into uncharacteristic mistakes and earn a 116-107 win and a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.",
      "NBA history suggests that the significance of this victory is hard to overstate: The team that wins Game 3 of an NBA Finals tied 1-1 goes on to win the series 80.5% of the time.",
      "Game 4 is Friday in Indianapolis.",
      "Oklahoma City scored only 18 points in the fourth quarter while making only six of its 17 shots, and it was outscored by 14 points in the game's decisive final 12 minutes. Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league's Most Valuable Player, was held to just 1-of-3 shooting over that span largely under the harassing defense of Pacers forward Pascal Siakam.",
      "Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 24 points but needed 20 shots, and he committed six turnovers.",
      "Indiana is 24-3 this season when it holds opponents to fewer than 110 points \u2014 including 14-0 at home.",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t all bad,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"But we definitely have to play our style and impose our will for more of the 48 minutes if we want to come on the road and get a win.\"",
      "Tyrese Haliburton scored 22 points with 11 assists and nine rebounds in a performance that was drastically more aggressive than three days earlier in a series-tying loss in Oklahoma City.",
      "Yet the Pacers' hero Wednesday was reserve Bennedict Mathurin, who failed to play even a single second during the opening quarter yet went on to score 27 points over his next 22 minutes. It was the highest-scoring performance by a reserve in the Finals since 2011, and his offensive outburst helped Indiana's reserves outscore Oklahoma City's 49-18.",
      "At halftime, holding a 64-60 lead, Indiana looked like a different team from the one that returned from Oklahoma City with a 1-1 split.",
      "It had scored more points in transition \u2014 one of the secrets of the team\u2019s postseason success \u2014 in just two quarters than it had scored in either of the two previous games. Indiana finished with 17 fast-break points, nearly tying its total from the first two games of the series.",
      "And the Pacers' reserves had scored 30 points by halftime, which was not only nearly half the team\u2019s total but also 19 more than Oklahoma City\u2019s own bench, the same unit that had decisively swung Game 2 in the Thunder\u2019s favor.",
      "Indiana point guard TJ McConnell and Mathurin were primarily responsible for that turnaround by the Pacers\u2019 bench. Shortly after they entered, the Pacers trailed by eight points, but McConnell had soon pestered the Thunder into three steals, including two in the backcourt. After turning up the pressure with each steal, McConnell gestured to his home crowd to turn up the noise.",
      "And after having made five shots total in the first two games of the series, Mathurin made five of his six shots in the first half alone of Game 3.",
      "\"This is the kind of team that we are,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"We need everybody to be ready. It\u2019s not always going to be exactly the same guys that are stepping up with scoring and stuff like that. But this is how we got to do it, and we got to do it as a team. And we\u2019ve got to make it as hard as possible on them.\"",
      "Their play earned Indiana a halftime lead. Yet Indiana\u2019s poor finish to the third quarter, scoring just five points over the final five minutes, earned it an uphill challenge, and a five-point deficit, entering the final quarter. Oklahoma City\u2019s vulnerability \u2014 perhaps its only one \u2014 was its lack of playoff experience, and it made the series\u2019 return to Indiana a critical opportunity for the Pacers.",

      "Yet despite their youth, the Thunder at times also showed steely resolve. Rather than become rattled by playing on the road, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams, in only his third season, led Oklahoma City out of tight jams with both his scoring and his passing late in the third quarter, and his layup with seven minutes to play in the fourth quarter helped erase what had been a four-point Indiana lead.",
      "But Indiana, so good at comebacks throughout this postseason, played superbly in the final minutes in building and protecting its lead.",
      "\"I was proud of the way we bounced back from a rough ending to the third quarter,\" Carlisle said. \"That was something that could have shaken us up a lot.\"",

      "Lakshmi Emory, whom Lewis once described as a \u201cphenomenal sister\u201d in a birthday message, shared news of her death in a June 11 Facebook post.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s free, and in His heavenly arms,\u201d she wrote next to a black-and-white photo of Lewis. \u201cLord, rest her soul.\u201d",
      "Emory did not share additional details, including Lewis\u2019 cause of death.",
      "Lewis was an MTV staple in the late \u201890s, hosting \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d and video countdown show\u201cHot Zone.\u201d She also hosted her own talk show \u201cThe Ananda Lewis Show\u201d in 2001.",
      "Lewis was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in 2019, but later revealed that she opted against the double mastectomy doctors recommended at the time.",
      "In a January 2025 op-ed for Essence, Lewis shared that she tried alternative methods to monitor her breast cancer, including cuting out alcohol, sugar, monthly ultrasounds, high-dose vitamin C IVs, hyperbaric chamber sessions and qigong exercise, among others.",
      "During the Covid-19 pandemic, she discovered that her tumor had grown and underwent genetically targeted fractionated chemotherapy, which is a treatment that destroys cancer cells without harming healthy ones, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "However, a PET scan done in October 2023 confirmed that her cancer had progressed to Stage 4 cancer. This time, she shared that she underwent treatment at an integrative facility.",
      "While Lewis had previously said she regretted refusing to undergo mammograms out of fear of radiation exposure, she urged the importance of women getting informed and learning about prevention.",
      "In her 2025 Essence piece, she wrote, \u201cGoing into 2025, I would say to women: Do everything in your power to avoid my story becoming yours. If I had known what I know now 10 years ago, perhaps I wouldn\u2019t have ended up here.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cI encourage people to look at the information and studies that exist. Seek them out, learn from them and apply the changes to your life, so that you can continue to thrive and live as long as you can.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 01:16:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Uniformed soldiers cheered and booed along with political statements, something typically frowned upon and potentially a violation of military regulations.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Department officials say troops who cheered and jeered Tuesday at President Donald Trump\u2019s political statements at a rally at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, did not violate military regulations, but a former military legal officer said they did just that.",
      "During the speech, uniformed soldiers yelled in support of Trump\u2019s political statements and booed former President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "\u201cDo you think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said to boos about Biden.",
      "Trump made other comments about Newsom and about Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, where protests against the administration\u2019s crackdown on immigrants have been taking place and where Trump has ordered thousands of National Guard members and active-duty Marines deployed in response. Other Trump comments about the \u201cfake news media,\u201d transgender people, protesters in California and flag-burning also drew boos from the uniformed military members in attendance.",
      "Trump is known for his rallies at which he goes after and pokes fun at political enemies and other issues, but typically he makes those remarks at political events, not on U.S. military bases.",
      "Such overt political activity on a base is the prerogative of the commander in chief. But military leaders would typically frown upon troops\u2019 reacting the way they did as inconsistent with military good order and discipline, and, according to one expert, it is a violation of military regulations found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.",
      "Presidents of both parties often use troops as political props and put them and their commanders in difficult positions by doing so, but Trump\u2019s speech took that to a new level, said Geoffrey DeWeese, a retired judge advocate general who is now an attorney with Mark S. Zaid PC. (Zaid has represented whistleblowers on both sides of the aisle, including one who filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment, and he was one of the people whose security clearances Trump revoked this year.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad tradition to use the military as a backdrop for political purposes,\u201d DeWeese said. \u201cTo actively attack another president or a sitting governor and incite the crowd to boo, that\u2019s a step in a dangerous direction, that really says we want to politicize the military, that sends a bad message.\u201d",
      "DeWeese said there were likely to have been violations of the UCMJ.",
      "\u201cI would be cringing if I was a senior officer and it happened under my watch,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said repeatedly that he wants to take politics out of the military by removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and banning service by transgender service members.",
      "Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who worked at the State Department and the National Security Council under former President George W. Bush and at the Pentagon under former President George H.W. Bush, said in an email that commanders at Fort Bragg should have done a better job preparing troops there.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s predictably bad behavior by the President to try and score political points in a military setting, and it\u2019s a command failure by leaders at Ft Bragg not to prepare soldiers for that bad behavior and counsel them not to participate.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon said in a statement that there had been no violation of the UCMJ and suggested the media was against policies that Trump has championed.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell also alleged in a statement that the media \u201ccheered on the Biden administration\u201d and its policies regarding the Defense Department \u201cwhen they forced drag queen performances on military bases, promoted service members on the basis of race and sex in violation of federal law, and fired troops who refused an experimental vaccine.\u201d",
      "\u201cBelieve me, no one needs to be encouraged to boo the media,\u201d Parnell said. \u201cLook no further than this query, which is nothing more than a disgraceful attempt to ruin the lives of young soldiers.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Army officials at Fort Bragg addressed the sale of some MAGA merchandise at the event, which was planned in cooperation with a nonpartisan organization, American 250.",
      "\u201cThe Army remains committed to its core values and apolitical service to the nation,\u201d Col. Mary Ricks, a spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s 18th Airborne Corps at Bragg, said in a statement. \u201cThe Army does not endorse political merchandise or the views it represents. The vendor\u2019s presence is under review to determine how it was permitted and to prevent similar circumstances in the future.\u201d",
      "The Army\u2019s own new field manual, published recently, says the apolitical nature of being a U.S. soldier is what contributes to the public trust.",
      "The Army \u201cas an institution must be nonpartisan and appear so, too,\u201d says the new field manual, \u201cThe Army: A Primer to Our Profession of Arms.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing nonpartisan means not favoring any specific political party or group. Nonpartisanship assures the public that our Army will always serve the Constitution and our people loyally and responsively.\u201d",
      "U.S. troops can participate in political functions, just not while on duty or in uniform, the book says.",
      "\u201cAs a private citizen you are encouraged to participate in our democratic process, but as a soldier you must be mindful of how your actions may affect the reputation and perceived trustworthiness of our Army as an institution,\u201d it says."

      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was \"uninvited\" to an annual White House picnic typically attended by members of Congress and their families, framing the move to reporters Wednesday as retribution for his opposition to key components of President Donald Trump's agenda.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re afraid of what I\u2019m saying, so they think they\u2019re going to punish me, I can\u2019t go to the picnic, as if somehow that\u2019s going to make me more conciliatory,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo it\u2019s silly, in a way, but it\u2019s also just really sad that this is what it\u2019s come to. But petty vindictiveness like this, it makes you \u2014 it makes you wonder about the quality of people you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d",
      "Paul, who said he attended picnics hosted by Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told reporters he called the White House on Wednesday to secure tickets to the annual picnic but was told he was not invited. He said he had family members flying to Washington to attend the event, including his son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-old grandson, who he noted owns a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.",
      "\u201cI just find this incredibly petty,\u201d Paul told reporters. \"I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been an intellectual opponent, a public policy opponent, and he\u2019s chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic and to say my grandson can\u2019t come to the picnic.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether Paul was ever invited to the event and whether Trump was directly involved in the decision to \"uninvite\" him.",
      "As Trump pushes Republicans to pass a package of measures to fund much of his domestic agenda by Independence Day, Paul is among the Senate Republicans poised to make that milestone unreachable, joining fiscal hawks in the party to balk at legislation the Congressional Budget Office estimates said would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit.",
      "In addition to his belief that the funding package would \"explode the debt,\" Paul has criticized spending cuts in the bill as \"wimpy and anemic,\" called planned Medicaid changes in the legislation \"bad strategy\" and proposed cutting billions of dollars for Trump's border wall from the bill.",
      "\u201cIn private, there\u2019s quite a few people in there who actually do think we could save some money and are open-minded to it and believe the administration should justify the numbers,\u201d Paul told reporters after a two-hour meeting on the bill Wednesday. \u201cEven if you\u2019re supportive, and I am supportive of border security, but I\u2019m just not supportive of a blank check.\u201d",
      "Paul said this week he plans to vote no on the legislation and speculated Wednesday that that might be among the reasons the invitation was rescinded.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m arguing from a true belief and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse, and they choose to react by uninviting my grandson to the picnic,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just think it really makes me lose a lot of respect I once had for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump has frequently lashed out at Paul in response to the sustained opposition, deriding him on Truth Social for his criticisms.",
      "\"Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting 'NO' on everything, he thinks it\u2019s good politics, but it\u2019s not,\" Trump wrote last week.",
      "Paul has emerged as a chief critic of Trump\u2019s fiscal policy, and he has intensely criticized his decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, arguing they will push the country into a recession.",
      "Paul, a libertarian conservative, was one of four Republican senators to back a Democratic resolution to block the implementation of Trump's Canadian tariffs, predicting at the time that the import penalties would \"threaten us with a recession\" and calling Trump's decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners \"a terrible, terrible idea.\" The effort has so far stalled in the House.",
      "Paul also joined Democrats in introducing a bipartisan resolution to undo the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs Trump imposed on dozens of countries, this time by terminating the national emergency he declared to implement the global penalties, arguing that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority.",
      "\u201cTariffs are taxes, and the power to tax belongs to Congress\u2014not the president. Our Founders were clear: tax policy should never rest in the hands of one person,\u201d Paul said in a statement about the bipartisan effort. \u201cAbusing emergency powers to impose blanket tariffs not only drives up costs for American families but also tramples on the Constitution. It\u2019s time Congress reasserts its authority and restores the balance of power.\u201d",
      "That effort failed to pass the Senate.",
      "Paul's differences with Trump even extend to the military parade taking place Saturday, which he likened to parades in countries led by dictators.",
      "\"I wouldn't have done it,\" Paul said Tuesday. \"The images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea, we were proud not to be that.\"",
      "But still, in the face of his criticisms of Trump, Paul appeared to view the rescinded invitation as a shock, noting that even Democratic lawmakers remain invited to the White House picnic.",
      "\"I think I\u2019m the first senator in the history of United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,\u201d Rand told reporters. \"Literally, every Democrat is invited, every Republican is invited, and to say that my family is no longer welcome, kind of sad, actually.\u201d"

      "It wasn\u2019t exactly the verdict that Harvey Weinstein accuser Kaja Sokola had hoped for, but it was the verdict she said women determined to fight against sexual predators needed.",
      "Sokola, a former runway model from Poland, was one of three women who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them more than a decade ago.",
      "On Wednesday, a Manhattan jury found Weinstein guilty of assaulting former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley but not her. And it deadlocked on a third-degree rape charge against Weinstein in the alleged sexual assault of former actor Jessica Mann.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for me,\u201d Sokola told NBC News shortly after the verdict was announced. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change that much the most important thing, that he\u2019s convicted.\u201d",
      "What does it mean for the #MeToo movement, which was galvanized in 2020 by Weinstein\u2019s landmark conviction for sexually abusing young women?",
      "\u201cI think it sends the message that we still have some work to do,\u201d said Sokola, 39.",
      "Sokola also said she doesn\u2019t want what happened to her in court to deter other sex assault victims from coming forward.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no win or lose for me. I was not the one who was on the trial,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would not want these kind of decisions to discourage others from speaking their truth or from participating in proceedings like this, because we have one life to live, and if we won\u2019t fight for our own justice, then who will?\u201d",
      "Sokola\u2019s attorney, Lindsay Goldbrum, a partner at Goddard Law PLLC, said she and her client were prepared for the outcome.",
      "\u201cWe are in a different culture than we were five years ago when this trial first happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as a former prosecutor, I knew from the beginning that it was going to be an uphill battle for the prosecutors to be able to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt about a crime that occurred almost 20 years ago.\u201d",
      "Sokola wasn\u2019t among the women who testified against Weinstein at his first trial, in which he was convicted of third-degree rape of Mann in 2013. He was also convicted of first-degree criminal sexual act for forcibly performing oral sex on Haley in 2006.",
      "The convictions were overturned after an appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case.",
      "Sokola was added to the case after she filed her own lawsuit against Weinstein in December 2019 under New York\u2019s Child Victims Act.",
      "On the stand, Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel in 2006, when she was 19 years old. The alleged abuse first began in 2002, when she was 16, and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.",
      "\u201cI know what he did to me when I was 16, when I was 19, and nothing will change that,\u201d Sokola told NBC News.",
      "Sokola\u2019s testimony may have been undermined by her estranged older sister, Ewa Sokola, who had been subpoenaed as a prosecution witness. She testified that Sokola seemed \u201cextremely tense\u201d after a 2006 post-lunch meeting with Weinstein but didn\u2019t say she had been assaulted.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d Ewa Sokola testified.",
      "Asked about that testimony, Sokola said, \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think she does, or she should have,\u201d she said of her sister.",
      "Sokola said she has never spoken with Haley and has talked to Mann just once, about two years ago.",
      "Initially, Sokola was part of a group of women who filed a class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and his companies, alleging he had sexually abused them. At first, she hid her identity behind a pseudonym.",
      "Unhappy with a proposed deal under which almost all the civil cases against Weinstein would be settled for $47 million and he would not have to admit to wrongdoing, Sokola unmasked herself in December 2019 when she filed her lawsuit.",
      "In the suit, Sokola said she was 16 in 2002 when she had just moved from Warsaw to New York City and was first introduced to Weinstein. She said that when he learned she wanted to become an actor, he told her he could help her career.",
      "Three days later, the complaint said, Weinstein picked Sokola up for what was supposed to be a business lunch and instead took her his Manhattan apartment and demanded sex.",
      "When a weeping Sokola tried to resist, Weinstein told her he had \u201cmade\u201d the careers of the actors Penelope Cruz and Gwyneth Paltrow and warned the teenager that she \u201cwould never work as an actress unless she acquiesced to his demands,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Sokola said at Weinstein\u2019s retrial that he demanded that she masturbate him while he touched her.",
      "Sokola, 39, became one of three women who accused Weinstein of sex assault at his retrial after she told prosecutors he had also forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.",
      "That allegation of assault mirrored the testimony of Haley, who accused Weinstein of doing the same to her in 2006 when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",
      "Weinstein, who was hit with an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act, denied assaulting Sokola. He also denied assaulting Mann and Haley.",
      "Weinstein spokesman Juda Engelmayer said that \u201cwe consider this a little bit of a victory\u201d because Weinstein was acquitted on the Sokola charge.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s feeling, you know, not good about being convicted for Miriam but relieved that he wasn\u2019t convicted on Kaja and hopeful on the Jessica part,\u201d Engelmayer said of Weinstein at a news conference.",
      "Sokola is getting back to the dreams she says Weinstein stole from her after the alleged assaults, with the launch of her own production company, Falcon 88.",
      "\u201cHealing means doing what I love and being able to be a helpful member of society, being a producer that listens to others, respects others, treats people with dignity that they deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s named after my dad. He was 88 years old when he died.\u201d",
      "Her first project is executive producing a film, \u201cThe Eden Express,\u201d starring Jonah Hauer-King and David Duchovny.",
      "Sokola is also a single mom with a young son. And when she was asked how she hopes her son will react when he finds out she testified against Weinstein, she smiled.",
      "\u201cI hope he will think that his mom is a badass and that his mom stands for the truth and is not afraid to speak her truth,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Under normal circumstances, moderating inflation and a weakening labor market would make an easy case for interest rate cuts.",
      "But these aren\u2019t normal times, and a scattering of headwinds on the horizon have made Federal Reserve officials leery of easing monetary policy for fear that the inflation fight isn\u2019t over.",
      "That sentiment is setting up an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank that could result in President Donald Trump taking the unusual step of naming a \u201cshadow\u201d chair whose responsibility it would be to watch over the Fed and Chair Jerome Powell until a permanent chief can be installed next year.",
      "There is \u201cfresh buzz\u201d around the idea that Trump could announce his choice to succeed Powell soon, \u201cas a shadow Fed chair in the interim,\u201d until the central bank chief\u2019s term ends, Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore, said in a note Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe idea would be to accelerate the timeframe over which the administration can put its stamp on the Fed and influence rates markets while avoiding the nuclear option of trying to fire Powell,\u201d Guha wrote.",
      "The practicality of such a move is sketchy. There are no imminent vacancies on the Fed\u2019s board of governors \u2014 save for Powell, a frequent Trump target whose term as head of the central bank expires in May 2026, though his governorship runs until 2028.",
      "Moreover, the impact of such a \u201cshadow chair\u201d likely would be minimal. It takes seven votes on the Federal Open Market Committee to move policy, and it would be hard to find more than one or two right now who would be in favor of the aggressive interest rate cuts Trump is seeking.",
      "Still, at least telegraphing now who he wants as chair could sent an important message to markets about the path Trump wants to see the Fed to take. The stakes were raised Wednesday following a comparatively benign inflation report showing prices up just 0.1% in May, and after Vice President JD Vance joined Trump in urging the Fed to cut rates.",
      "The stakes for a new chair",
      "The candidate list for chair seems to have been narrowed, and Trump noted Friday that he expects to make his preference public soon. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The list of apparent finalists includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Each has assets and liabilities, but the most important quality could be a tilt towards sharply lower rates, with an aggressive timetable.",
      "\u201cI think Trump\u2019s going to pick someone who\u2019s going to be uber-dovish,\u201d billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones said during a Bloomberg News interview Wednesday. \u201cWe are fiscally constrained. We\u2019re going to have budget deficits of 6% plus [compared to gross domestic product] as far as the eye can see. One of the major offsets if I was the president would be to lower my interest rate costs by appointing a Fed chair who is as dovish as could possibly be.\u201d",
      "Powell has been reluctant to push for cuts until the longer-term effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs can be better gauged.",
      "As Jones sees it, Trump has no other choice than to swing away from the moderate-to-hawkish Powell with the U.S. in a \u201cdebt trap\u201d that eventually will cause a market revolt.",
      "The budget deficit is heading toward $2 trillion for 2025 and actually is above 6% of GDP. Costs to finance the $36 trillion debt are estimated at $1.2 trillion this year and likely could be headed north of that as Treasury yields remain lofty. The easiest way for the U.S. to ease some of that burden would be Fed rate cuts that at least would ease some of those financing costs, which are running higher than any other budget category except Social Security and Medicare.",
      "So which way does Trump turn?",
      "Evaluating the candidates",
      "Guha, the Evercore analyst, sees positives and negatives in each prospective candidate.",
      "Warsh, he said, \u201chas direct Fed policy experience, is well-known to markets and Fed officials, and has the benefit of being perceived as being independent while maintaining cordial and constructive relations with the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "His downside: A leaning toward hawkishness on inflation and away from expansionary balance sheet policies that have been the Fed\u2019s hallmark since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "On Bessent, who emerged this week as a favorite, according to a Bloomberg report, his upside is market bona fides and stature as the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in the organized chaos of the Trump administration. However, a lack of monetary policy experience and perception of being \u201ctoo close to the Trump administration, and not sufficiently independent,\u201d could work against him perception-wise, Guha said.",
      "More of a longshot, Hassett has solid economic credentials but limited monetary policy experience and might, Guha said, also be perceived as being too close to the administration.",
      "Finally, Waller has the benefit of a folksy demeanor while his recent statements advocating \u201cgood news\u201d rate cuts later this year could put him in good standing with Trump. However, he could pay a price for supporting the 50 basis point rate cut last September, ahead of the November presidential election.",
      "For Trump, the challenge will be to pick someone credible who shares his vision on lower rates and easier policy and who can get through a Senate confirmation where Republicans hold the advantage, albeit a fragile one, and leadership that still wants an independent central bank.",
      "\u201cHopefully, whoever is selected is an individual that feels strongly that monetary policy should be set consistent with the dual mandate and not be politically influenced,\u201d former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said during a CNBC interview Wednesday. \u201cBut that remains to be seen.\u201d",

      "The defense did not call key figures central to the theory it laid out in those initial proceedings \u2014 that Read was the victim of a biased police investigation and a plot that sought to frame her for the killing \u2014 and opted instead for a series of experts whose testimony sought to dismantle the prosecution\u2019s evidence.",

      "Among them were three crash reconstruction specialists and two pathologists. Also called to the witness stand was a snowplow driver who offered what was perhaps the defense's most direct challenge to the case Norfolk County special prosecutor Hank Brennan had presented.",
      "Blizzardlike conditions descended on the Boston area on Jan. 29, and the driver, Brian Loughran, testified that before the snow grew heavy, he made multiple passes on the residential street in Canton where O\u2019Keefe was found unresponsive.",
      "O\u2019Keefe was discovered near a flagpole in the front yard of a now-retired Boston police sergeant, Brian Albert, shortly after 6 a.m. \u2014 a little over three hours after, Loughran said, he first passed the home in his plow, nicknamed \u201cFrankentruck\u201d for what he described as its mismatch of parts.",
      "Loughran said he knew the Albert family \u2014 he used to deliver pizzas for Brian Albert\u2019s brother \u2014 and he testified that he could clearly see from his truck to Albert\u2019s front door.",
      "\u201cWhat was on the ground in the area of the flagpole?\u201d defense attorney David Yanetti asked.",
      "\u201cNothing,\u201d Loughran responded.",
      "\u201cDid you see a 6-foot-1, 216-pound man lying on that lawn?\u201d Yanetti asked.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Loughran said.",
      "After a night of drinking, O\u2019Keefe was supposed to have gone to a gathering at Albert\u2019s home early Jan. 29. Brennan has said he never made it inside. Although prosecutors presented no direct evidence of the collision that they said mortally wounded O\u2019Keefe, vehicle data presented at trial showed Read suddenly reversing her Lexus at 12:32 a.m. at 24 mph in front of Albert\u2019s home.",
      "An accident reconstruction expert called by Brennan testified that dozens of abrasions found on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s right arm were consistent with injuries caused by the broken right taillight on Read\u2019s SUV.",
      "Read has said she dropped O\u2019Keefe off outside Albert\u2019s home and watched him enter. Her lawyers have said he was most likely beaten at the gathering \u2014 perhaps because she had recently flirted with, then ghosted, a federal agent who was also at the event \u2014 before O'Keefe was bitten by Albert\u2019s German shepherd, dragged outside and left in the snow. (Albert and the agent, Brian Higgins, have denied playing roles in O'Keefe's death.)",
      "One of the defense witnesses, a former emergency room doctor and forensic pathologist who said she had seen hundreds of dog bites in her career, testified that the dozens of abrasions on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm were not from a broken taillight but from a dog.",
      "The defense\u2019s final witness, a biomedical engineer who examined whether O\u2019Keefe\u2019s injuries were the result of a collision, testified Wednesday that they were not. Experiments conducted for the case using crash test dummies showed that at speeds of 24 mph, there most likely would have been more damage to Read\u2019s car and to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm, said the engineer, Andrew Rentschler.",
      "Absent from the witness stand were three people whose testimony played an outsized role in the first trial: Albert, Higgins and former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor.",
      "Proctor, who was fired after an internal investigation found that he sent derogatory texts about Read and shared confidential investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel, acknowledged during the first trial that he said \u201cunprofessional\u201d things about Read. But he rejected the defense\u2019s claims that he led a biased investigation.",
      "The defense mentioned Proctor repeatedly during Read\u2019s retrial, with defense attorney Alan Jackson at one point asking his supervisor whether his conduct tainted their examination of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThe investigation was done with honor and integrity, and the evidence pointed in one direction,\u201d State Police Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik responded."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/david-hogg-dnc-vice-chair-vote-malcolm-kenyatta-rcna212023",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 22:18:24 GMT",
    "summary": "The Democratic National Committee determined it failed to follow internal rules in the February election. Separately, Hogg\u2019s plans to back primaries against incumbent Democrats stirred controversy.",
    "story": [
      "Progressive activist David Hogg said he won\u2019t seek to continue as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after the DNC called for a redo of the February election that elevated him to the post.",
      "Shortly after the DNC announced it would hold new elections Thursday for two vice chair positions held by Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as a result of a procedural challenge, Hogg announced he wouldn\u2019t be a candidate.",
      "The decision comes amid a public spat with the DNC and its chairman, Ken Martin, over Hogg\u2019s decision to support primary challenges to Democratic incumbents, a spat that loomed over the vote even though it wasn\u2019t directly related to the challenge that ultimately led the party to call for a new election.",
      "Hogg made the announcement in a lengthy statement that criticized the Democratic Party for a lack of vision and a refusal to pass the torch to the next generation. But his discussion about the DNC and the vice chairmanship specifically was more muted.",
      "\"I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to have disagreements. What isn\u2019t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,\" he said in the statement.",
      "\"Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.\"",
      "Martin praised Hogg's for the party in a brief statement, saying, \"I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.\u201d",
      "\u201cI commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map,\" Martin said.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The DNC had voted hours earlier to accept a recommendation from its Credentials Committee that the party hold two new vice chair elections because it found the DNC mistakenly created an advantage for the two male candidates, Hogg and Kenyatta, as it managed the internal elections at the end of a marathon February party meeting in Washington.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the DNC announced that 75% of the votes its members cast in a virtual election were in favor of the recommendation, a vote of 294-99. It said 89% of its members participated in the virtual election.",
      "Because DNC rules require equal gender representation on its executive committee, not including the party chair, the results of elections in February meant the DNC had to elect at least one man to its final two vice chair slots. But instead of holding individual votes for each position, one to be filled by a man and one by a candidate of any gender, the party decided to hold one vote to decide who took the final two slots.",
      "Oklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in February, petitioned the DNC for a redo, claiming the decision to combine the ballots unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta over the female candidates who were eligible for the final vice chair slot.",
      "Though Free\u2019s challenge was filed well before Hogg\u2019s public spat with Martin, Hogg framed the decision last month as proof that the party was trying to strip him of his title over his support for primary challenges to Democratic incumbents. Martin and Kenyatta vehemently disagreed with his framing: Martin blamed a \u201cprocedural error\u201d from \u201cbefore I became chair\u201d for the episode, and Kenyatta criticized Hogg for distracting from the party\u2019s work by arguing the vote amounted to personal retribution.",
      "After the new election was called, Kenyatta said in a statement that \u201cnow we can almost bring this chapter to a close,\u201d adding that he looked forward to \u201cmaking my case to DNC members and our party as a whole\u201d in the snap election.",
      "\u201cWe need a strong Democratic Party and I hope we come out of this stronger and focused on the work ahead,\u201d he said.",
      "With Hogg's decision to step aside, Kenyatta is assured of winning his vice chair position back by the end of the week. The party will effectively be replacing Hogg with the winner of a subsequent vice chair election among the three candidates who were on the final ballot in February.",
      "Tensions between Hogg and the party have been brewing for months, since he telegraphed his decision to back Democratic primary challenges through a political group he started, Leaders We Deserve. Hogg, who rose to prominence as a political activist after he was one of the victims of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, argued in his statement Wednesday night that his mission to push the Democratic Party toward \"a new vision for the future and leaders to bring us there\" was most important to him, as he accused Democrats of thinking too small.",
      "\"After seeing a serious lack of vision from Democratic leaders, too many of them asleep at the wheel, and Democrats dying in office that have helped to hand Republicans an expanded majority, it became clear that Leaders We Deserve had to start primarying incumbents and directly challenging the culture of seniority politics that brought our party to this place to help get our party into fighting shape again,\" he said.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Politico published a short clip of an internal Democratic Party call on which Martin vented his frustration with Hogg, saying the fight has \u201cessentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to.\u201d",
      "The leak prompted another round of finger-pointing, with prominent DNC members accusing Hogg or his allies of orchestrating it. Hogg vehemently denied that and published a screenshot that he said showed his text messages with the reporter who published the story.",
      "Even if Hogg had decided to run again and won his seat back, Martin has said he would propose a neutrality pledge for officers that could have forced Hogg to choose between his party role and his role with the outside group he founded."

      "Zion Miller (played by Nathan Mitchell) rises to the fore of the show not only as Georgia\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest, but as a father reckoning with the emotional toll his absence has taken on his daughter, Ginny.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mitchell reflects on Zion\u2019s evolution and the weighty arcs shaping the Miller family dynamic this season.",
      "One of the most powerful moments comes in therapy, where Ginny opens up about how much Zion missed in her life.",
      "To recap, Zion and Georgia met as teenagers. When she became pregnant with Ginny, his parents stepped in to care for the infant. After they requested guardianship, though, Georgia ran away. She was gone for a year but returned, beginning Georgia\u2019s longest on-again, off-again romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cIt was really cathartic,\u201d Mitchell says of Zion and Ginny's conversation. \u201cZion is someone who\u2019s always followed his own path, but he cares deeply about Ginny. That scene shows him realizing the full impact of his absence.\u201d",
      "As Ginny continues to navigate trauma, secrecy and identity, Mitchell says Zion shares the blame.",
      "\u201cIf he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d Mitchell reveals. \u201cHe finally sees what Georgia is capable of and realizes he needed to be the stable force all along.\u201d",
      "This season, Zion provides calm amid the chaos, stepping up for both Ginny and Georgia \u2014 even as Georgia faces legal trouble.",
      "\u201cGeorgia has this chaotic energy. Zion is the contrast,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s fiercer, more protective now. That\u2019s been exciting to play.\u201d",
      "The drama intensifies when Zion broaches the idea of joint custody. Mitchell hints at what\u2019s to come: \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Georgia will be open to sharing custody of Ginny with Zion,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in for some spicy drama.\u201d",
      "Zion\u2019s growing involvement as a father forces Georgia to confront a reality she\u2019s long resisted: that Ginny isn\u2019t hers alone.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s always felt Ginny needed to be with her no matter what,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cBut Zion\u2019s love and commitment are just as valid. The tension will come from whether Georgia can finally acknowledge that and make space for him.\u201d",
      "With Ginny making adult decisions, including an abortion, Zion\u2019s parenting style is more visible than ever: steady, open-hearted, and nonjudgmental.",
      "\u201cZion honors Ginny\u2019s autonomy,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cSometimes you need to be firm, but more often, you need to be loving and present.\u201d",
      "Still, the road ahead isn\u2019t smooth. Ginny begins to mirror Georgia\u2019s manipulative traits, raising alarms for Zion.",
      "\u201cHe fears she might internalize the wrong lessons,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s encouraging her artistic side, her growth, but he\u2019s worried.\u201d",
      "Mitchell, though not a father himself, offers a message for parents: \u201cBe present. Be open. Vulnerability matters. Listen. You don\u2019t need all the answers \u2014 just care.\u201d",
      "Co-creators Sarah Lampert and Sarah Glinski echoed these themes. Glinski highlighted the therapy session between Ginny and Zion as a turning point.",
      "\u201cGinny always blames her mom, but the therapist asks, \u2018Where\u2019s your dad in all this?\u2019\u201d Glinski says. \u201cThat question shifts Ginny\u2019s perspective. She begins to hold Zion accountable too.\u201d",
      "Lampert says, \u201cThere\u2019s so much love, but also dysfunction. Zion stepping up now doesn\u2019t erase the past. But it does matter.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, Season 4 teases even more drama between Zion and Georgia. But at its heart, both parents are learning to prioritize Ginny\u2019s future, however messy that road might be."

      "Wilson's death was announced by his family on his official social media accounts.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.\u201d",
      "News of Wilson\u2019s death comes after his legal representatives said in 2024 that he had been suffering from a \u201cmajor neurocognitive disorder\u201d and suggested he be placed in a conservatorship.",
      "Wilson co-created The Beach Boys with his brothers Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and their friend Al Jardine in 1961, and would go on to become the band\u2019s primary songwriter.",
      "The Beach Boys scored an early hit with the harmony-drenched single \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d and went on to appear on the Billboard Top 40 single charts dozens more times with hits including \"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" \u201cI Get Around,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby, \u201cCalifornia Girls\" and \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "The band's genre-bending 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d primarily written, arranged and produced by Brian Wilson, is often recognized as a pop masterpiece by music critics, mentioned in the same breath as The Beatles\u2019 1967 landmark album \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201d",
      "Wilson's composition style, inspired in equal parts by 1950s doo-wop and Bach, combined simple coming-of-age lyrics about teenage crushes with deftly original instrumentation and rich vocal harmonies.",
      "He and the other members of The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2000.",
      "In his personal life, Wilson struggled with mental health issues and addiction, and had been diagnosed, at various times, with depression, schizoaffective disorder and paranoia, according to the Washington Post.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived a very, very difficult, haunted life,\u201d he told the publication in 2007.",
      "Wilson spent years in the round-the-clock care of celebrity psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy, who was later accused of trying to control the musician's life and was barred from contacting Wilson.",
      "The pair's unorthodox relationship was depicted in the 2015 film \u201cLove & Mercy.\u201d",
      "Wilson was a father of seven. He shared two daughters \u2014\u00a0Carnie Wilson and Wendy Wilson of the pop band Wilson Phillips \u2014\u00a0with his first wife Marilyn Wilson, and five other kids with his late wife Melinda Ledbetter, who died in January."

      "It's been three years since the actor made a brief appearance on the CBS daytime drama to mark the show's 35th anniversary. Before that, Wagner played Nick from 2003-2012.",
      "So, what brings the character back this time around? Love, naturally.",
      "\"Nick is coming back because he heard that Brooke\u2019s (Katherine Kelly Lang) heart is broken and what\u2019s happened in this triangle with Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) and Taylor (Rebecca Budig),\" he tells TODAY.com during a video interview.",
      "For those not in the know, Brooke Logan's relationship with her longtime love, Ridge Forrester, has hit a rough patch in recent months.",
      "The on-again, off-again couple are currently on the outs after a series of unfortunate events, including a power struggle at Forrester Creations and the return of Ridge's ex-wife, Taylor Hayes.",
      "Despite Brooke's best efforts to win Ridge back and pry him away from Taylor, she has yet to succeed. And that's where Nick, another one of Brooke's former flames, comes in.",
      "\"He\u2019s decided that he\u2019s going to step in and try to wake Brooke up to this toxic pattern she\u2019s been in with Ridge for years and years,\" Wagner explains. \"That is his primary motivation. (It's like he's saying to Brooke), 'I am back to try to get you to wake up and realize that I\u2019m still in love with you, and I want you to step out of this insanity.'\"",
      "Brooke and Nick also have a complicated history. Over the years, Nick has been romantically linked to Brooke's two sisters and one of her daughters, in addition to Taylor. But Wagner says his character keeps coming back to Brooke since she was \"his initial love.\"",
      "In the years since viewers have last seen Nick, he\u2019s had a lot going on, and fans will get to learn a bit more about his backstory.",
      "\u201cI really felt he needed to upgrade from living on the Shady Marlin (his boat). Like he wasn\u2019t this scruffy, bearded, smoking sea captain anymore. This guy is now a shipping titan. He runs Marone Industries, an international shipping company,\" Wagner says.",
      "While preparing for his return to the show, Wagner advocated for an upgraded wardrobe that was fit for his character's advanced professional status. He also had a say in how his character would present himself when he reunited with Brooke.",
      "\u201cI told Brad (Bell, executive producer and head writer of the show), 'I think the key here is masculine. This has to be real masculine, confident energy from Nick,'\u201d he says.",
      "While shooting on location on Italy's Amalfi Coast and Capri, Wagner and Lang re-created a famous scene from their characters\u2019 past: the moment they first saw each other at Forrester Creations.",
      "\"We tried to re-create that as best we could with Kelly trying on some lingerie, and all of a sudden I'm kind of like, 'Who\u2019s there?'\" he recalls.",
      "Talking some sense into Brooke is Nick's main goal, but he will briefly interact with a few other characters, including Taylor and Ridge, his rival and half brother.",
      "\u201cWhen Ridge comes into the scenes, he\u2019s surprised. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 Nick is unmoved and doesn\u2019t have one ounce of fear when it comes to Eric Forrester (John McCook) or Ridge or anything that has to do with the powerful Forrester family. He is unmoved, confident and fearless,\" Wagner says.",
      "Viewers won't get to see Nick and Brooke's son, Jack, on screen, but they will get a quick update on how he's doing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reference because we didn\u2019t feel we had time to really explore that storyline. That could be (a) future (storyline). But for right now, we needed to just kind of focus on Nick trying to wake Brooke up out of this toxic pattern with Ridge and the Forresters,\" Wagner says.",
      "Returning to the show after all these years felt like \"jumping on a moving train\" for Wagner in the best possible way.",
      "\"Kelly and I love to work together, and we collaborate very nicely,\" he says of his co-star. \"And Brad (Bell) collaborates with the dialogue and things I want to do for the character.\"",
      "In recent years, Wagner has starred as Bill Avery on the Hallmark series \"When Calls the Heart,\" and he was able to squeeze in his \u201cB&B\u201d story arc just before he\u2019s set to return to Vancouver to film the latest season of the show.",
      "The actor has a packed schedule but is still leaving the door open to returning to \u201cB&B\u201d for some more action.",
      "\u201cWe talked about it, and (Bell) said, \u2018I really would love to maybe keep this character alive. How do you feel about it?\u2019\" Wagner says. \"So I just got the script for my final scenes with Brooke after the whole location shoot in Italy, and it looks really promising.\"",
      "Viewers will have to tune in to see exactly what happens, but Wagner is happy to give a little teaser, saying, \"It's really a big deal how he leaves it and Brooke's reaction to what Nick presents for her.\"",
      "Looking ahead, the actor says it \"might be possible\" to pull double duty on \u201cB&B\u201d and \u201cWhen Calls the Heart.\u201d",

      "Rodgers was recently spotted wearing a ring on that finger while appearing on an episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d podcast. However, this is the first time the athlete has spoken publicly about his new marital status.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Rodgers' team for additional comment.",
      "While appearing on an episode of \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on April 17, Rodgers acknowledged that he was seeing someone special.",
      "\"I'm in a different phase of my life. You know, I'm 41 years old. I'm in a serious relationship. I have off-the-field stuff going on that requires my attention. I have personal commitments that I've made not knowing what my future was going to look like last year that are important to me,\" he said at the time.",
      "Earlier this year, Rodgers\u2019 fans learned that he would not be returning to the New York Jets as a quarterback. He has now assumed a role as quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
      "The football player was previously engaged to actor Shailene Woodley but the couple went their separate ways in 2022."

      "This past week, performer, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d finalist and makeup mogul was spreading natto on lavash.",
      "\u201cBack on my bulls---,\u201d she said before taking a bite.",
      "The pairing of the Japanese fermented soybean dish with the Armenian flatbread shows her palate is as adventurous as her drag persona.",
      "This international culinary philosophy is documented in her debut cookbook, \u201cKim Chi Eats the World,\u201d which comes out on Oct. 21 from publisher Union Square & Co.",
      "The book features 75 recipes inspired by Kim Chi\u2019s life thus far \u2014 from her childhood in both South Korea and the U.S. to the countries she\u2019s visited during her drag career.",
      "Kim Chi has said on social media that the book was developed during the pandemic when she couldn\u2019t travel and wanted to re-create the dishes she\u2019s had all over the world in her own kitchen.",
      "It is separated into four main parts \u2014 one for each continent covered \u2014 and consists of foods from 21 countries: ketchup chips from Canada, lemon sole from France, roasted flour soup from Switzerland and pineapple cake bars from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt all stems from my experiences,\u201d Kim Chi tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about food from around the world and how other people eat.\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "The worlds of drag and home-cooking have been intertwined for decades. Back in 1996, Honey Van Campe published \u201cThe Drag Queen\u2019s Cookbook & Guide to Sensible Living.\u201d",
      "Over the years, queens like Ruby Ann Boxcar, Ginger Minj and Silky Nutmeg Ganache have dropped their own cookbooks. Trixie Mattel, a frequent Kim Chi collaborator, was nominated for a James Beard award in 2018 for making a peanut butter jelly sandwich and a cocktail.",
      "\u201cWith my book, the idea is introducing global cuisine to the American audience,\u201d Kim Chi says, adding that she\u2019s developed recipes that are easy to replicate using pantry staples. \u201cSo even if someone has never had a specific dish, they can easily just go to a grocery store, get all the ingredients they need and try out the recipe. I wanted to make the global flavors fun and accessible.\u201d",
      "Kim Chi \u2014 named after the Korean fermented vegetable dish \u2014 has a litany of food-based entries on her resume: She has partnered with Chipotle and Trejo\u2019s Donuts; she appeared on Hulu\u2019s \u201cDrag Me to Dinner\u201d with fellow \u201cDrag Race\u201d Season 8 finalist Naomi Smalls; she hosts the \u201c1 For The Table\u201d podcast with YouTuber and cook Jon Kung; and she\u2019s posted what she\u2019s eaten on the road from Singapore to Oregon on her food-focused Instagram account.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny how drag and food overlap,\u201d she writes in the introduction of her cookbook. \u201cBoth are about creativity, storytelling, and, most of all, a little drama. When it comes to blending eyeshadow or blending spices, I want everything to be just right. But what really ties drag and food together is the way they both unite people.\u201d",
      "Her love of food developed early. Born in Lansing, Michigan, she moved to South Korea when she was five and then back to the Midwest when she was 12.",
      "She describes the \u201cculture shock\u201d of the cafeteria at school \u2014 leaving behind the fresh variety of a Korean midday meal to eat a typical American lunch. This led her to the kitchen, fostering a lifelong interest in foods that don\u2019t come with a mini-carton of milk.",
      "\u201cAfter growing up in Korea and then moving to the States, being able to recreate the Korean dishes that my grandmother or my mom used to make in Korea was a good way to connect to my culture, especially where I grew up in small-town Michigan,\u201d Kim Chi says. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t that much diversity.\u201d",
      "She says that in those formative adolescent years, her mom worked a lot, so she was in charge of cooking for her and her brother.",
      "\u201cAt home, I\u2019d just be creative, because ... we were poor,\u201d she says. \u201cI always worked with whatever ingredients we had in the kitchen and I would get really creative, and sometimes the recipes wouldn\u2019t work out, but when it did, it would be a hit.\u201d",
      "A childhood staple in the book that was also born out of the need to be creative is budae jjigae, aka \u201cArmy Base Stew,\u201d a hearty noodle stew that originated after the Korean War, as South Korean soldiers used U.S. military rations. Ingredients like Spam, kielbasa, baked beans and American cheese are simmered in a classic soup base of gochujang and kimchi.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "She says she hopes some of her recipes help picky eaters branch out.",
      "Another recipe, Taiwanese ice cream wraps, features \u00ada crepe base, taro ice cream, grated candied peanuts and cilantro \u2014 a combination of flavors one might not expect in a dessert.",
      "\u201cI want the audience at home to experience the same shock I had when I tasted it,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like life is too short to eat the same boring food over and over again, you know?\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if you don\u2019t like it, maybe this will make you more open-minded towards different types of food. It\u2019s a great way to learn about how people live, the climate and the types of ingredients that they have access to,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019ll also make you more open-minded towards the world overall.\u201d"

      "\"I always used to say, 'I'm never getting married,'\" Cooper said in her new Hulu docuseries, \"Call Her Alex.\"",
      "\"I thought it would threaten my independence \u2014 no man should be able to say that I'm his. My view changed with Matt.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Who Is Matt Kaplan?",
      "Matt Kaplan, 41, is a Hollywood producer who's made his mark in the entertainment industry with hit projects like Netflix's \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" franchise and the spinoff \"XO Kitty.\"",
      "After working for CBS and Lionsgate Films, Kaplan founded Chapter One Films in 2013, per Deadline, and later established Ace Entertainment in 2017, where he serves as founder and CEO.",
      "Kaplan was previously married to actor Claire Holt from 2016 to 2017.",
      "Today, Kaplan and Cooper have co-founded media company Trending together.",
      "The love story that started on Zoom",
      "Cooper and Kaplan's love story began in July 2020, when Cooper had a long day full of online meetings with film and television companies.",
      "Her last meeting of the day was with Ace Productions, Kaplan's company. Cooper later dubbed him \"Mr. Sexy Zoom Man\" on her podcast.",
      "\u201cYou know those people you meet immediately that it\u2019s just like you feel like you\u2019ve known each other for so long?\u201d Cooper explained on an episode of \u201cCall Her Daddy.\u201d \u201cWe immediately vibed, and it was just like we\u2019re going to get along so well.\u201d",
      "Though the television show they discussed in that meeting didn't pan out, the couple decided to take a chance on each other.

      "\u201cI think overall I\u2019m really enjoying his company,\u201d she shared with her listeners in August 2020. \u201cAre we making plans for the future? Yeah. Am I obsessed with him? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "Looking back, Kaplan appreciates the quirky nickname that started it all.",
      "\u201cMr. Sexy Zoom Man. I think that name that she created was silly but honest of how we met,\u201d he says in Cooper\u2019s new docuseries. \u201cI think it allowed me to ease my way into the Call Her Daddy fandom, because I enjoy being a behind-the-scenes person.\u201d",
      "Their Riviera Maya wedding",
      "The couple got engaged at Cooper\u2019s West Hollywood home in May 2023 during what she thought was a W Magazine photoshoot but was actually an elaborate proposal setup.",
      "Almost a year later, in April 2024, the couple tied the knot in Riviera Maya, Mexico.",
      "Cooper made the bold choice to walk down the aisle by herself, she told Vogue.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",
      "The couple's dogs, Henry and Bruce, served as ring bearers, while Cooper's brother Grant officiated the ceremony.",

      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",

      "She told W Magazine after their engagement why Kaplan was able to change her mind about marriage.",
      "\u201cWe had a really great dynamic early on that I didn\u2019t have in previous relationships, which is the amount that we communicate \u2014 even over communicate \u2014 about difficult things. Having that foundation of honesty and trust allowed us to get through things in life that made it so I couldn\u2019t envision anyone else by my side. On top of that, we have this insane chemistry.\u201d",

    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",

    "summary": "V. E. Schwab's newest novel, \"Bury Our Bones In the Midnight Soil,\" is a fantasy story about three queer vampires,",
    "story": [
      "For years, V. E. Schwab hasn\u2019t felt \"gay enough.\"",
      "\"With quotation marks \u2014 obviously it's an absurd concept,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"There is no such thing, and I know that.\"",
      "Schwab's journey coming out as queer started about 10 years ago, she says. But the hit fantasy author \u2014\u00a0known for 2013's \"Vicious,\" 2015's \"A Darker Shade of Magic,\" the 2020 BookTok darling \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" and more \u2014 has long strived to \"assimilate\" into the genre.",
      "When she started publishing, she downplayed the fact that she's a woman. And though her stories always featured LGBTQ+ characters, (in a 2018 tweet, Schwab notably said all characters in her \"Shades of Magic\" series \"should be presumed queer unless stated otherwise\"),\u00a0she didn't lead with her own \"queerness,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't want to do anything that would limit the growth of readership,\" Schwab says.",
      "The result was that \"no one ever thinks I'm gay,\" she reflects now. She thought she didn't mind. If blending behind the pseudonym of her initials meant someone may read her books, not knowing the breadth of identities ahead, and learn something? Better than someone not picking up the book at all, she says.",
      "In 2020, Schwab told her coming out story publicly in an essay for Oprah Daily. But it wasn't until her latest novel, \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil,\" out June 10, that she felt comfortable living, being, existing in that story.",
      "\"What I didn't predict and what turned out to be true is the catharsis of writing this book as a gay person,\" Schwab says. \"I did not realize how badly I needed to write this in order to take up the space of this story.\"",
      "\u2018I Can't Think of Any Greater Gift\u2019",
      "\"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil\" follows three women across a 500-year period, with alternating perspectives. The book opens with 10-year-old Maria in 1500s Spain. We next meet Alice, a college first-year in 2019 trying to face her anxiety at a party. Within pages, both Maria (who later renames herself Sabine) and Alice describe themselves \u2014 or who they want to be \u2014 as \"feral.\"",
      "Then there's Charlotte, or Lottie, born in 1800s England, who knots their stories all together.",
      "All three start as young women chafing against their circumstances, until another woman arrives. (Sabine encounters a widow passing through her home of Santo Domingo, Charlotte encounters Sabine, and Alice encounters Charlotte.) Their stories are different, but end the same: Each woman leaves dead \u2014 specifically, as a vampire.",
      "Schwab was inspired by the \"classic\" vampiric lore \u2014 \"everything from 'Carmilla' essentially up through Anne Rice,\" she says.",
      "\"If you go back and you look at these classic vampires, they're inherently queer, they're inherently liminal, they represent knowledge and the danger of being exposed to an alternate potential future,\" she says. \"And the idea is that once you're exposed, you can never go back to ignorance.\"",
      "A longtime love of vampires was just one of the \"ingredients\" that went into \"Bury Our Bones.\" (\"I see my stories as a meal,\" Schwab explains.) Other themes include queer love throughout history and collateral damage, first explored through what Schwab had long been taught about one-night stands.",
      "\"I'm an only child, and for some reason, my parents thought the way to keep me safe growing up \u2014 I remember this coming in at like, 13, it was a lesson for my future \u2014\u00a0was to never have a one-night stand,\" Schwab says, explaining she was taught that by definition, the act involves being in close quarters with a complete stranger and \"putting yourself in inherent danger.\"",
      "\"I always thought this was a hysterical take,\" she adds.",
      "For Alice's storyline, Schwab followed this lesson to its most extreme conclusion. In the spirit of taking on the mantle of a \"New Alice\" at university, Alice invites a woman (Charlotte) home to have sex ... and wakes up dead, paying the price of Charlotte's desire.",
      "She's robbed of a choice, but she's granted the metaphorical and literal teeth that ensure ultimate survival.",
      "\"I think we spend so much time with male vampires as the lead, and I'm like, 'They don't need it,'\" she says. \"You know who actually needs teeth, is the person who is made to feel small, told to limit their desire, told never to be insatiable, told never to want, told exactly how little they are supposed to take up in the world.\"",
      "To Schwab, the most important moment in the book occurs when Alice in the present day realizes the she has nothing to be afraid of. No, everyone else fears her.",
      "\"The thing about an immortal is that they endure. That is, by definition, what they do. They endure when you shouldn't be able to, and I can't think of any greater gift to give my lesbian women than the sense that they would get to know they would endure,\" she says.",
      "Writing Herself Into the Story",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com less than two weeks before publication date, Schwab says she's feeling \"deep, deep, crashing out in real time-level neuroses.\" Normally she'd be on deadline for her next project, but she purposefully finished a first draft of her next work (\"Victorious,\" the third and final book in the \"Villains\" series) early to be present for the release of \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil.\"",
      "\"In many ways, this story is about the three eras of my own queer coming out journey, and going from not knowing who you are, to just wanting to be loved, to being unapologetic,\" Schwab says. \"There's just a lot more nonfiction underpinning the fiction than I'm used to.\"",
      "Sabine represents the version of Schwab that was able to write a book like this, she says. Sabine is unapologetic about her beliefs, actions and behaviors, even as the novel's \"villain.\" She's fully realized and uninterested in \"conforming to anyone else's idea of what a life is,\" Schwab says.",
      "\"I think I had to get to her in my own journey before I could look back at my Alice and Lottie years,\" she says.",
      "Alice, the youngest of the pack, starts the novel open about her sexuality but struggling to define herself out of the shadow of her sister. She stands in for a version of Schwab who was trying to find her identity while dealing with the \"whiplash\" of a major event shaking one's foundation. For Schwab, it was realizing she was gay. For Alice, it was waking up a vampire.",
      "Then there's the \"Lottie years,\" or as Schwab calls them, \"the toxic years.\" Charlotte is defined by \"desperately wanting to be loved,\" even at the expense of others.",
      "When asked for one true \"villain\" of her vampire novel, Schwab gives the potentially hot take of Lottie. (\"We do not stan someone who perceives themselves as a victim when they are an abuser,\" Schwab says.) But all three women make terrible decisions and do awful things. That's, too, a reflection of Schwab's experience coming out and her relationship with publishing.",
      "\"For many, many years, even after I had come out, there was a sense that you could not write a queer villain, lest the readership conflate queerness and villainy,\" she says. \"It's such a harmfully reductive take because it suggests that queer characters, and by extension, queer humans, are not afforded the same level of complexity and nuance as their straight counterparts.\"",
      "By embracing a trio of \"messy b----es\" to lead the novel, every page, sentence and word, Schwab says, hones in on one purpose: hunger.",
      "\"I wanted to write a book about hunger in all of the forms that it takes, specifically for women and femme-presenting people and queer people \u2014 the hunger to be loved, to be seen, to be understood, and the hunger to take up space in a world that tries to make you small,\" she says. \"I think that's what I achieved.\"",
      "Returning to 'the Garden' \u2014 and the Easter Egg You Might Have Missed",
      "Before \"Bury Our Bones,\" Schwab didn't think she'd ever put herself \"so clearly\" into a project again. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" featured a character named Henry, whom Schwab describes as a character she \"wrote myself into.\"",
      "In the 2020 novel, the titular character trades being forgotten by everyone she meets for immortality. Henry is the first person who remembers her after her deal with the devil.",
      "If Addie and her sense of hope are an inspiration, the story of Sabine, Charlotte and Alice is more about the messes immortal beings leave behind.",
      "\u201cI wanted something a little bit angrier,\u201d Schwab says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an indicator of my own growth as a person. I think that\u2019s an indicator of the landscape of the world. I just spend a lot of my time feeling stifled or angry or what have you.\u201d",
      "It's fitting then that \"Bury Our Bones\" is set in the same universe as \"Addie LaRue.\" Both are Schwab's take on \"urban fantasy, but in a literary way,\" she says, a world facsimiled of our own that she refers to as \"the Garden.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit this space, because it's a place that I really enjoy creatively and aesthetically,\" Schwab says. \"I can see the Garden growing together and apart and in multiple directions.\"",
      "There's even a cameo from a character in \"Addie LaRue\" in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment more than halfway through the book, told in Charlotte's perspective. The goal is to establish that in this Garden, \"there are multiple kinds of magic and wonder and monstrosity just intertwined with our time and place and our history.\"",
      "Schwab says only eagle-eyed readers may spot the reference. And though she calls it the \"loosest thread\" she'd likely ever tie between her Garden books, it has consequences for the wider story.",
      "\"It has a repercussion if readers stop and think about it, which is that these characters are occupying the same terrain,\" Schwab says. \"They are coexisting in the same landscape. Addie's history has at some point tangled with one of our vampires.'\""

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The new executive chairman for the controversial American-backed humanitarian organization distributing aid in the Gaza Strip refused to reveal the donors who are financing the agency, though he did tell NBC News that to his knowledge the group is not funded by the Israeli government.",
      "Johnnie Moore, an evangelical Christian and former PR consultant who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, was appointed executive chairman of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) last week as the organization reeled from the resignation of his predecessor. It has also faced criticism from the United Nations and aid groups for a lack of independence from Israel, which backs the organization along with the U.S.",
      "Since it started operating late last month, the group has set up aid distribution sites in Gaza in response to international pressure over serious malnutrition in Gaza, where Israel recently lifted an 11-week complete blockade on food, aid and medical supplies entering the enclave.",
      "But regular bouts of deadly violence in and around those sites has also brought increasing scrutiny on the GHF\u2019s source of funding and the degree of autonomy it has from Israel.",
      "In an exclusive interview last week, Moore said it was \u201ca private foundation.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans.\u201d",
      "Pressed on accusations that Israel was financing and controlling the organization, Moore said that \u201cbased upon what I know, this is an independent initiative that is not funded by the Israeli government.\u201d",
      "Other questions have also swirled around the GHF, even before it launched four aid distribution points in southern and central Gaza.",
      "A day before it began operations in the strip, Moore\u2019s predecessor Jake Wood resigned, saying in a letter published by Reuters that continuing to work with the group would compromise his \u201cneutrality, impartiality and independence.\u201d",
      "United Nations agencies and major aid groups that previously ran hundreds of community kitchens and bakeries in the enclave have also refused to cooperate with it, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid, forces widespread displacement in Gaza, and concentrates distribution in areas that may not be accessible to everyone.",
      "Setting up so few sites for food distribution meant crowd control problems were inevitable, according to Ciaran Donnelly, the senior vice president for international programs at the International Rescue Committee, which ran major relief operations in Gaza. \u201cNo aid organization would recommend doing it that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Inside Israel, as well, critics have questioned its independence. Last month in front of Israel\u2019s legislature, opposition leader Yair Lapid, without providing evidence, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of funding the GHF through foreign shell companies. And last week, citing unnamed public officials, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Israeli government had sent hundreds of millions of shekels to the group.",
      "Israel\u2019s government has repeatedly denied it funds the GHF.",
      "Any organization \u201cbeing used by occupying powers\u201d would not be able to carry out its task according to the humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence, said Philip Grant, the executive director of TRIAL International, a Geneva-based nongovernmental organization that advocates for victims of war crimes.",
      "TRIAL International has called on the Swiss government to investigate GHF, whose only registered presence outside the U.S. is in Geneva.",
      "While the GHF has said it is working to open new sites, including in northern Gaza, no such distribution points have opened yet, forcing some Palestinians with advanced injuries and disabilities to walk long distances for aid \u2014 often through dangerous areas and extreme heat.",
      "Such onerous requirements for something as basic as food could amount to war crimes, Grant said, and could even lead to accusations that organizations like GHF are complicit.",
      "\u201cThis operation comes with a huge risk in terms of violations of the Geneva Conventions,\u201d Grant said. \u201cEspecially the forced displacement of populations, which, if carried out, would be a participation in the war crime of enforced displacement of civilian population.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Views of the U.S. and confidence in its leader to handle world affairs have taken a dive in more than a dozen countries over the last year, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday and conducted over the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "These declines are most pronounced among residents in neighboring Mexico and Canada, which have been at the center of high-profile spats with the administration, as well as a handful of NATO countries (like Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands) amid Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.",
      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",
      "Men, younger people and those who view their country's right-wing populist parties favorably are more likely to have more confidence in Trump.",
      "For example, 51% of Japanese people ages 18 to 34 have confidence in Trump, according to the poll, while 31% of Japanese people 50 years or older say the same.",
      "In the United Kingdom, 45% of men say they have confidence in Trump, compared with 28% of women.",
      "Respondents across 13 nations registered a double-digit decline in confidence in the U.S. president on world affairs from 2024 to 2025. While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.",
      "The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word \"arrogant\" described Trump well.",
      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A life-size Labubu figure has been sold in China for more than $170,000, a record for the highly sought-after toothy monster toy boosted by celebrities.",
      "The 4-foot-tall mint-green doll, whose price included a 15% commission, was traded in Beijing on Tuesday at what was billed as the world\u2019s first auction dedicated to Labubu collectibles. Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.",
      "The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "The \u201cintense\u201d bidding showed the \u201cgrowing momentum of pop art in the auction market,\u201d Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall. Coming in third was a set from a series called \u201cThree Wise Labubu\u201d \u2014 one doll crossing its arms, one making a peekaboo gesture and one covering its mouth \u2014 that sold for more than $80,000, including commission.",
      "The success of Labubu at auction reflects the \u201cgrowing presence\u201d of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.",
      "\u201cIn a somewhat stagnant art auction market, this development is both stimulating and indicative,\u201d he told NBC News via a messaging app.",
      "Created in 2015 by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, Labubu is one of \u201cThe Monsters\u201d in his children\u2019s book series inspired by Nordic mythology. With high, pointed ears and serrated teeth, the small monster is \u201ckind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,\u201d according to Pop Mart.",
      "Labubu dolls are often sold in \u201cblind boxes,\u201d sealed packages whose contents are revealed only upon opening. In the U.S. store, one blind box from a recent collection retails for $27.99, while a set of six costs $167.94, though prices can more than double on resale sites such as eBay.",
      "The dolls have also been popularized by celebrities such as Rihanna and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink, both of whom have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags.",
      "Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Mart shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.",
      "In the first three months of this year, Pop Mart\u2019s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.",
      "As Labubu\u2019s popularity soars globally, Wang Ning, the founder of Pop Mart, became $8 billion richer from 2024 to 2025, a fivefold increase in his wealth, according to Forbes.",
      "CORRECTION (June 11, 2025, 11:40 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misidentified the Chinese retailer behind the popular Labubu products. It is Pop Mart, not Pop Market."

    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
      "The Kirchner governments carried out \u201can extraordinary fraudulent maneuver\u201d that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.",
      "Supporters of Fern\u00e1ndez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina\u2019s two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalizing cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez rejected the decision, calling the court justices \u201cpuppets\u201d of those wielding economic power in the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,\u201d she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the opposition. It\u2019s the concentrated economic power of Argentina\u2019s government.\u201d",
      "Gregorio Dalb\u00f3n, one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s lawyers, vowed \u201cto take this case to all international human rights organizations.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges."

      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
