    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Additional arrests may follow as the investigation continues.",
      "The more than 100 investigators that Beccuau said are assigned to the case are combing through 150 DNA samples, surveillance footage and evidence left behind in the thieves\u2019 wake.",
      "Those assigned include the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry, the special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts.",
      "Recovering the jewels could be among the most difficult parts of investigators' work. French authorities have added the jewels to Interpol\u2019s Stolen Works of Art Database, a global repository of about 57,000 missing cultural items.",
      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",
      "But don\u2019t expect a flood of updates. Indictments and verdicts are not routinely made public in France. French trials are not televised, and journalists are not allowed to film or photograph anything inside the courtroom during a trial.",

      "FIFA has started selling another million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup",
      "FIFA began the process of selling another 1 million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup on Monday, with the opening of a new ticket draw marking the start of the tournament\u2019s second phase of sales.",
      "This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.",
      "The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.",
      "\u201cWe already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.\u201d",
      "Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.",
      "Residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order \u2014 purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.",
      "Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.",
      "FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year\u2019s World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.",

An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina \u2014 featuring Lionel Messi \u2014 and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.",
      "Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.",
      "Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats \u2014 set at $60 \u2014 were available for at least 40 matches. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.",
      "Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer\u2019s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.",

      "June Lockhart, beloved for her roles in \u201cLassie\u201d and \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died at 100",
      "LOS ANGELES -- June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \u201cLassie\u201d or up in the stratosphere in \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died. She was 100.",
      "Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.",
      "\u201cShe was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\u201d",
      "The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.",
      "From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \u201cLassie.\u201d From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",
      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

      "Also gutted was the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which ensures that students with disabilities get the services they\u2019re entitled to under federal law. It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",
      "The new layoffs have been halted by a federal judge. But as the shutdown drags on, more states are likely to break federal laws unknowingly because they can\u2019t get help from the government, said Neas, who led the special education office under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople of good intention and good faith are going to have honest questions that they're not going to be able to get an answer for,\u201d Neas said.",
      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, a lot of districts are just going to continue to follow the old guidance because it\u2019s the best thing they have,\u201d Martin said.",
      "McMahon has acknowledged that only Congress can fully eliminate the Education Department, despite Trump's campaign pledge to shut it down. As a workaround, officials have been developing plans to transfer core functions to other agencies.",
      "The Education Department already moved some of its adult and career education programs to the Labor Department in July. The Labor Department now oversees federal Perkins grants, which go to states to fund career and technical education.",

      "The Supreme Court paved the way for that work to continue in a July decision overturning a lower court order blocking the department\u2019s wind-down.",
      "At her Senate confirmation hearing, McMahon also said special education programs might fit under the Department of Health and Human Services, and that the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights could be moved to the Justice Department.",

      "The new deaths were reported in Hawaii and Oregon, the CDC said. Previous deaths were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Utah. One person who became ill was pregnant and it resulted in the death of a fetus.",
      "The outbreak has been traced to precooked pasta produced by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. In September, the company recalled nearly 245,000 pounds (111,130 kilograms) of pasta, including cases of linguine, fettuccine, penne and other products sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads.",
      "The move came after tests showed that pasta made by Nate's Fine Foods contained the same strain of listeria found in chicken fettuccine Alfredo and meatball linguine products identified in the outbreak. FreshRealm, the San Clemente, California, company that produced those meals, used genetic sequencing to confirm the link to the outbreak.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments.

Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",

      "The court heard arguments Wednesday in a 2019 case challenging the constitutionality of a law that states only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.",
      "The law, dating to the 1970s, was struck down as unconstitutional by Superior Court judge Josie Garton last year, a victory for the group that brought the challenge, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky. The state appealed Garton's ruling.",
      "Planned Parenthood has argued there is no medical justification for the restriction and that it unfairly burdens those seeking an abortion by limiting the pool of those qualified to provide care. In 2021, Garton granted the group\u2019s request to allow advanced practice clinicians \u2014 health care workers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants \u2014 to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. They have continued to do so and since the 2024 ruling also have been able to provide procedural abortions, Planned Parenthood says.",
      "Advanced practice clinicians routinely provide care similar in risk and complexity to that of providing abortion services, and in 25 states can provide medication abortion, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said in court documents. Planned Parenthood's advanced practice clinicians seek to provide abortion care in just the first trimester, the attorneys said.",
      "Since Garton's 2021 decision, advanced practice clinicians have been providing \u201cnearly all\u201d medication abortions in Alaska, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the state have been able to offer medication abortion each day they've been open, the attorneys wrote. Before that, doctors hired by Planned Parenthood on a per diem basis \u2014 at the clinics on limited days \u2014 were able to offer medication abortions perhaps once or twice a week at each clinic, they wrote.",
      "A vital statistics report released by the state this year shows that the total number of abortions in Alaska has been fairly consistent \u2014 1,229 in 2021, 1,247 in 2022, 1,222 in 2023 and 1,224 last year. The report says that could include cases where medication was provided to manage a miscarriage, but without providing a number. It also says reasons for ending pregnancies are not reported to the state.",

      "BERLIN -- The organization that handles claims on behalf of Jews who suffered under the Nazis said Wednesday that Germany has agreed to extend another $1.076 billion (923.9 million euros) for Holocaust survivors ' home care around the globe for the coming year.",
      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cThis historic increase to home care funding reflects the complex and growing needs of Holocaust survivors worldwide,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference.",
      "\u201cWhile we are losing survivors at a rapid pace each year, those who remain are older, frailer and in greater need than ever before,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \"This budget is critical in providing each of them the opportunity to age in place, a dignity that was stolen from them in their youth.\u201d",
      "The average age of survivors receiving home care through Claims Conference funding has increased from 86 in 2018 to 88.5 in 2024. Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children",
      "Amanda Porretto isn't sure she'll ever have children.",
      "At 27, she is the average age of new mothers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's feeling the pressure as an only child. Her father wants to be a grandfather and her mother, before she died, always told Porretto that she would eventually want to be a mom.",
      "\u201cSome people think it's a bad thing\u201d not to have a child, said Porretto, who works in advertising. \u201cI just don't think I need to bring more people into (the world) when there's so much here currently that we need to fix.\u201d",
      "Younger generations of Americans are increasingly citing climate change as making them reticent to have children, according to several studies. They are worried about bringing children into a world with increasing and more intense extreme weather events, a result of climate change, which is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when oil, gas coal are burned. And they are concerned about the impact their offspring will have on the planet.",
      "In a 2024 Lancet study of people 16 to 25 years old, the majority of respondents were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d worried about climate change. The study also found that 52% said they were hesitant to have children because of climate change. Adults under 50 years old without children were four times more likely than adults over 50 without children to say that climate plays a factor in their decision, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found more than half of respondents said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d to whether climate change made them question having children.",
      "Parenthood and climate change are related not just because of fears for a child's well-being, but also by concern for the planet's well-being.",
      "Compared to the carbon emissions of all the other decisions, \"having a child is by far, by orders of magnitude, larger,\u201d said Nandita Bajaj, executive director of Population Balance, which is a nonprofit focused on humans' environmental impact.",
      "Unlike other choices, procreation comes with something that bioethics professor Travis Rieder of Johns Hopkins University calls \u201ccarbon legacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not only doing carbon expensive activities like buying a larger house and a larger car and diapers and all that,\" said Rieder. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating someone who is going to have their own carbon footprint for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "That child might have children, and those children might have children, creating an impact that lasts generations, Rieder added. Of course, the logical extreme of minimizing an environmental footprint means having no children, Rieder said, which he is not advocating.",
      "It's tricky to quantify the impact of a child. That's because there's no consensus on what percentage of their impact is the parent's responsibility, and partly because the impact of that child depends on their parents' lifestyle.",
      "\u201cOne of the best predictors of how carbon-expensive they\u2019ll be is how wealthy you are,\u201d Rieder said.",
      "For example, the U.S. emits 123 times more carbon emissions than Ghana, according to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. Adjusted for population size, that means the average American emits more than 12 times as much as the average Ghanan.",
      "Procreation might have the largest climate impact, but when it comes to actions people can take to reduce their personal contribution to global warming, having fewer children often isn't discussed.",
      "Researchers who study climate change and family planning give two reasons.",
      "\u201cIf a person tells you that they\u2019re expecting or that they are pregnant, the immediate response is to offer some kind of support, congratulate them, that sort of thing,\" said Trevor Hedberg, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Arizona.",

      "The other factor, said Rieder: the impact of procreation sometimes is tied to conversations about overpopulation.

      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are health and safety challenges in this work,\u201d said Simai, an independent farmer who said she makes around $50 per month to help support her small family of two. The work may be more challenging for those with larger families, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Moolenaar, who represents a district he handily won last year, responded: \u201cWe have time to negotiate, figure out a plan going forward and I think that\u2019s something that could occur.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have shown urgent concern. In a letter sent to Johnson, a group of 13 battleground House Republicans wrote that the party must \u201cimmediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of health care affordability\u201d once the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cWhile we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed.",
      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",

      "In rural Ukraine, attack drones are assembled in secret to strike deep into Russia",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- At a secret location in rural Ukraine, columns of attack drones are assembled at night and in near silence to strike deep inside Russia.",
      "Their targets are strategic: oil refineries, fuel depots, and military logistics hubs. Since the summer, Ukraine\u2019s long-range drone campaign has ramped up dramatically, pounding energy infrastructure across Russia and stretching Moscow\u2019s air defenses thin.",
      "Built from parts made in a scattered network of workshops, these drones now fly much further than at any point in the war.",
      "Officers in body armor move with quick precision; headlamps glow red to stay hidden. Engines sputter like old motorcycles as exhaust fumes drift into the moonless night. Minutes later, one after another, the drones lift from a makeshift runway and head east. The strikes have caused gasoline shortages in Russia, even forcing rationing in some regions and underscoring a growing vulnerability in the country\u2019s infrastructure.",
      "Western analysts say the attacks on energy infrastructure so far have had a serious \u2014 but not crippling \u2014 effect. Ukrainian drones have repeatedly hit 16 major Russian refineries, representing about 38% of the country\u2019s nominal refining capacity, according to a recent review by the Carnegie Endowment, a U.S.-based think tank.",
      "But it argues the actual impact has been considerably more limited: most plants resumed operations within weeks, and Russia\u2019s refining output has been cushioned by idle capacity and existing fuel surpluses.",
      "The deep strikes have, however, given Kyiv the initiative at an important moment. The United States and Europe are ramping up sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil industry even as Kyiv\u2019s request for U.S. long-range Tomahawk missiles has stalled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine\u2019s improved long-range strike capability is causing real damage \u2013 forcing the Kremlin to import fuel and curb exports. \u201cWe believe they\u2019ve lost up to 20% of their gasoline supply \u2014 directly as a result of our strikes,\u201d he told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv.",
      "At the secret launch site, the commander overseeing the operation \u2014 a broad-shouldered man identified by his call sign, \u201cFidel,\u201d in accordance with Ukrainian military regulations \u2014 watches through night-vision goggles as the drones climb into the star-filled sky.",
      "\u201cDrones are evolving,\u201d Fidel told The Associated Press. \u201cInstead of flying 500 kilometers (310 miles), now they fly 1,000 ... Three factors go into a successful operation: the drones, the people and the planning. We want to deliver the best result. For us, this is a holy mission.\u201d",
      "Much of Ukraine\u2019s fleet is homegrown. The Liutyi, a workhorse of the nightly attacks, is a waist-high craft with a sausage-shaped body, a propeller at the back, and a distinctive triangular tail.",
      "It looks neither sleek nor intimidating \u2014 more Home Depot than Lockheed Martin \u2014 but the ease of assembly means it can be kept hidden and constantly tweaked: optimized to slip through heavily monitored frontline airspace.",
      "Typical of Ukraine\u2019s no-frills war production philosophy, the Liutyi \u2014 whose name means \u201cfierce\u201d in Ukrainian \u2014 has become a symbol of national pride and recently featured on a local postage stamp.",

Attacks a year ago damaged refineries in a much narrower range, mostly in western Russian border regions. Costs have also come down, further testing expensive air defense systems, with long-range drones now being produced in Ukraine for as little as $55,000.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that Ukraine is getting better at taking the war inside Russia,\u201d said Adriano Bosoni, director of analysis at RANE, a global risk analysis firm. \u201cFor most of the war, Russia operated on the assumption that its own territory was safe. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d",
      "The strategic logic is attrition by logistics, he argued: by forcing Russia to reroute supplies and commit air defenses to a wider area, Kyiv seeks to degrade Moscow's capacity to sustain large-scale operations.",
      "The Paris-based International Energy Agency says repeated drone strikes have cut Russia\u2019s refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels a day. That\u2019s triggered domestic fuel shortages and curbed exports of diesel and jet fuel, even as overall global oil production remains steady and prices stable.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s homegrown strike capability allows independent drone launches, bypassing the Western approval required for imported long-range weapons. That autonomy preceded tougher sanctions on Russia: allies escalated only after Ukraine had spent months hitting Russian refineries.",
      "On the ground, each mission is a study in tradeoffs. Fewer than 30% of drones even reach the target area, so meticulous planning is essential, said Fidel, who reflected on the human cost. \u201cWar has fallen to our generation so that we can fight for our kids and they can live in a free democratic country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are currently obtaining experience that will be used by every country in the world, and we are paying the price with our lives and the lives of our friends.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Families of the scores of people killed in a deadly gang raid by Rio de Janeiro police began burying the dead on Thursday, with residents left reeling by the scenes of carnage and livid at law enforcement whom they accuse of excessive force, torture and extrajudicial killings.",
      "In the Vila Cruzeiro favela, where the bodies were lined up next to one another a day prior, many voiced their shock, grief and anger as government ministers and lawmakers came to hear the demands of the community.",
      "At least 132 people were killed during Tuesday\u2019s operation, including four policemen, according to a Thursday tally by Rio de Janeiro\u2019s public defenders\u2019 office.",
      "A day after a raid that many described as feeling like a war, the low-income neighborhood showed signs of a return of everyday activities, with a few restaurants and shops once again awaiting customers.",
      "\u201cI came to work because I have to, but my mental health is shattered,\u201d said Monique Santiliano, a 40-year-old local who runs a nail salon in front of the favela rights\u2019 group CUFA in Vila Cruzeiro, part of the sprawling Penha complex of urban communities.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an operation, these were assassinations. They didn\u2019t come to arrest, they came to kill,\u201d Santiliano added, her voice shaking.",
      "Conservative Rio state gov. Claudio Castro said on Tuesday that Rio was at war against \u201cnarco-terrorism,\u201d a term that echoed the Trump administration in its campaign against drug smuggling in Latin America. He called the operation a success.",
      "Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo told residents and journalists gathered in Penha that she did not accept that claim and that the fight against organized crime should target masterminds and financiers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no point in coming into our communities and exposing children, the elderly and people with disabilities to such terror,\u201d she said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s raid, conducted by some 2,500 police and soldiers, targeted the notorious gang Red Command in the Complexo de Alemao and Complexo da Penha favelas. It drew gunfire and other retaliation from gang members, sparking scenes of chaos across the city on Tuesday.",
      "The state government said those killed were criminals who resisted the police.",
      "But the death toll, the highest ever in a Rio police operation, sparked condemnation from human rights groups, the U.N. and intense scrutiny from authorities. Brazil's Supreme Court, prosecutors and lawmakers ordered Rio state Gov. Claudio Castro to provide detailed information about the operation.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes scheduled a hearing with the state governor and the heads of the military and civil police next Monday in Rio.",
      "While some in Brazil, particularly right-wing voters and politicians, applauded the operation against the heavily-armed gang, others questioned whether it would achieve lasting results and argued that many of those killed were low-ranking and easily replaceable.",
      "Otoni de Paula, a conservative lawmaker, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the disparity between the number of deaths of police officers and of suspects at the very least raises questions.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re dealing with an ambush whose sole objective was execution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot think that the state can grant the police the right to kill anyone.\u201d",

      "Trump described his Thursday meeting with Xi as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans. Their deals were a relief to a world economy rattled by trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to skip APEC fits with his well-known disdain for big, multi-nation forums that have been traditionally used to address huge global problems, but his blunt dismissal of APEC risks worsening America\u2019s reputation at a forum that represents nearly 40% of the world\u2019s population and more than half of global goods trade.",

      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for a deeper strategic partnership between Europe and Turkey",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Europe should forge a deeper strategic partnership with Turkey in response to emerging global challenges, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday on his first official visit to Ankara, which has played a crucial mediating role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Merz was speaking alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, just days after Turkey and the United Kingdom finalized a multi-billion-dollar deal for the sale of 20 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Germany, part of the consortium that manufactures the advanced fighter aircraft, recently lifted its longstanding objection to their export to Turkey.",
      "Merz\u2019s visit also comes amid reports of German backing for Turkey\u2019s participation in a European defense initiative known as the Security Action for Europe, or SAFE - a 150-billion-euro ($173.5 billion) program designed to enhance the continent\u2019s military capabilities. The initiative allows non-EU countries, including Turkey, to join defense projects.",
      "Greece openly opposes Turkey\u2019s participation in the SAFE program, arguing that Ankara must first drop its standing threat of war linked to sea boundary disputes between the two NATO members.",
      "Merz did not mention SAFE but underscored the importance of cooperation. \u201cGermany and Turkey should use the enormous potential of our relations even better in the coming months and years,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere are compelling reasons for this, because we are entering a new geopolitical phase marked by the politics of great powers,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cA central conclusion from that for me is that as Germans and Europeans, we must expand our strategic partnerships, and there is no way around a good and deepened partnership with Turkey.\u201d",
      "Divisions surfaced during the joint news conference over human rights and the situation in Gaza.",
      "The advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, had urged Merz to speak out against Turkey\u2019s crackdown on the opposition, including the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The opposition figure, widely seen as a potential challenger to Erdogan, has been held in pretrial detention since March on corruption charges, which he denies. This week, Turkish authorities filed new charges against him for alleged espionage.",
      "Merz avoided direct mention of Imamoglu but said: \u201cDecisions have been made in Turkey that do not yet meet the requirements regarding the rule of law and democracy as we understand them from the European point of view.\u201d",
      "Erdogan responded by defending Turkey\u2019s judicial system: \u201cNo matter what position you hold, if you trample on the law, judicial authorities in a state governed by the rule of law are obliged to take whatever action is necessary.\u201d",
      "On the issue of Gaza, Merz said that Germany has stood firmly by Israel since it was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust and will always do so. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that we respect or accept every political decision by an Israeli government and accept it without criticism.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump seemed to love his whirlwind Asia trip",
      "TOKYO -- For an \u201cAmerica First\u201d president, Donald Trump seemed to love his whirlwind five days skipping across Asia \u2014 a reflection of a White House that is increasingly focused on the rest of the world.",
      "When Trump stepped off Air Force One on Sunday for his first stop in Malaysia, he danced with local performers who had greeted him on the red carpet. In Japan, he helicoptered to a mammoth aircraft carrier for a speech with the country's prime minister. And South Korea gave him a gold medal and crown as gifts.",
      "Back home in Washington, the federal government was shut down as Trump\u2019s poll numbers remain low, and it's unclear how much Trump's trip will resonate with voters consumed by other concerns at home.",
      "Yet on the last night of his trip, Trump was overheard at a state dinner talking about how much he enjoyed meetings with his foreign counterparts.",
      "\u201cThat was a great meeting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re all great meetings. This was a great meeting. We had a fantastic meeting.\u201d",
      "Had a president who once used the term \u201cglobalist\u201d as a slur suddenly found the fun in being a little bit globalist? He definitely likes the international deal making, the parties in his honor, the praise from other leaders and the possibility of leaving his mark on the wider world.",
      "The president sees diplomacy as a way to fulfill his domestic agenda of returning manufacturing to America and creating factory jobs, said Carla Sands, who was the U.S. ambassador to Denmark during Trump's first term and is now chair of the foreign policy initiative at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is working as fast as possible to reindustrialize America, bring jobs back home, and secure better trade deals for the American people and businesses,\u201d Sands said.",
      "The ebullience abroad also reflects the mood of a president who has struck economic deals and helped smooth relations between warring nations.",
      "He helped to affirm a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. There\u2019s a detailed list of nearly $500 billion in investment commitments from Japan. And South Korea pledged $150 billion to help revive American shipbuilding, including a project to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine \u2014 on top of $200 billion in investments over a decade to the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt's not globalism to go to other countries and stand up for America,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a former White House aide who traveled to Asia and other foreign destinations with Trump in his first term. When Trump travels, he makes sure \u201cthe globe is fully aware that this president is going to stand up for the American people first,\u201d Gidley said, making it \u201cthe exact opposite of globalism.\u201d",
      "As for the dancing?",
      "\u201cLook, when you're scoring touchdowns, it's OK to dance in the end zone,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cAnd this president is scoring touchdowns and running up the score.\u201d",
      "Many Trump voters believed they were electing a president who would focus on them instead of distant countries. But Trump in his second term is increasingly finding it easier to sell the idea of America with jaunts to Asia and the Middle East.",
      "The shift in tone reflects foreign governments\u2019 strenuous efforts to keep Trump happy, like stationing American-made vehicles near him in Tokyo and featuring U.S.-raised beef on the menu.",
      "Trump is increasingly showing confidence that he can play on the global stage, instead of grinding metaphorical axes as he did during his first term by attacking NATO and finding ways to intimidate and frustrate allies such as Angela Merkel, then the chancellor of Germany.",
      "\u201cHe appears to believe in his skills as a one-on-one negotiator with world leaders,\u201d said Jasen Castillo, a professor with a focus on national security at Texas A&M University. \u201cAll of this suggests that his foreign policy ventures are genuine.\u201d",
      "Still, it\u2019s not always clear what Trump is trying to achieve, other than a chance to declare victory. Some of his trade talks have led to foreign countries promising investments, but not necessarily the careful negotiations on which durable coalitions are built.",
      "\u201cWhat can confuse observers is that he lacks a consistent, coherent world view,\u201d Castillo added.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- The death toll in a major police raid targeting a drug trafficking gang in Rio de Janeiro has risen to at least 121 people, authorities said Thursday morning.",
      "The operation began Tuesday in two of the city\u2019s favelas, sparking intense gunbattles. An unknown number of people were wounded. Among the dead were four police officers, according to officials.",
      "The number of dead rose from 119 to 121, but further details on the two new deaths weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Human rights organizations have called for investigations into the deaths, describing the operation as one of the most violent in Brazil\u2019s recent history.",
      "Police said that the raid followed a yearlong investigation into the Red Command criminal gang, which controls drug trafficking and other illicit activities in the low-income communities of Complexo do Alemao and Penha. The group originated in Rio\u2019s prison system and has expanded its influence in recent years.",
      "During the operation, officers arrested 113 people, seized 118 weapons and confiscated more than a ton of drugs, police said.",

      "Rio has long been the scene of deadly police raids. In March 2005, 29 people were killed in the Baixada Fluminense region, which borders Rio. In May 2021, 28 died in a raid in the Jacarezinho favela.",
      "However, the scale of Tuesday\u2019s operation was unprecedented. The action sparked protests and accusations of excessive force and calls for the resignation of Rio\u2019s governor.",
      "On Thursday morning, community leaders in Penha gathered at the headquarters of favela rights group CUFA to prepare legal support for grieving families. Many shops remained closed, and the atmosphere was somber.",

      "After a devastating landslide five months ago, the Swiss village of Blatten might have been left for dead",
      "BLATTEN, Switzerland -- When a devastating landslide all but swallowed his Swiss village and toppled his three-generation family-owned hotel in May, Lukas Kalbermatten was overwhelmed by a sense of emptiness before the emotions hit. But he choose not to dwell on them long, and snapped into action to rebuild.",
      "The hotelier's response sums up a mindset of many of the 300-odd residents of Blatten: They could have left their bucolic village in the southern L\u00f6tschental valley for dead \u2014 but instead decided to try to see it come alive again one day, and are taking steps to rebuild.",
      "Authorities evacuated villagers and livestock, but a 64-year-old man was killed as 9 million cubic meters of ice, stone and earth tumbled down from the Kleines Nesthorn peak on May 28. The landslide left a trail about 2-1/2 kilometers (about 1-1/2 miles) wide and 100 meters (about 330 feet) high in places.",
      "It all came down in about a half-minute, coating the valley in plumes of dust for kilometers (miles). More than 90% of village homes and buildings were destroyed.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were emotional of course, but I didn\u2019t get much too emotional,\" Kalbermatten said. \"I was really realistic and the emotions, they came later after three or four days.\"",
      "If the toll had been higher, locals say, many might not have wanted to return to Blatten.",
      "Kalbermatten, whose website for his Hotel Edelweiss in Blatten shows it half-sunk in a pea-soup-green pond created by the disaster, joined up with other local families to set up a temporary hotel at the summit of a gondola lift in the neighboring village of Wiler \u2014 one of three villages in the valley where most Blatten residents relocated.",
      "\u201cFor tourism in this valley it\u2019s also a catastrophe because we don\u2019t have enough beds for all the tourists,\" he said Tuesday. \u201cThe most important for us is to do something quickly.\u201d",
      "Laurent Hubert, co-owner of the Nest- und Bietschhorn hotel and restaurant near Blatten, said it was \u201cpulverized\u201d last May. His wife, Esther Bellwald, is spearheading the new hotel with Kalbermatten. Its website said the families of the staff were \u201call deeply shaken and endlessly sad\u201d after the hotel was destroyed.",
      "\u201cThis project is a bit of the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Hubert said in knee-deep snow near the construction site, with crews in short sleeves working fast under sunny skies for a planned Dec. 18 opening of the \u201cMomentum\u201d hotel.",

      "Others queued up to claim lost items found by cleanup crews \u2014 books, family photos, and heirlooms like a wedding dress.",
      "Manfred Ebener, the construction coordinator in Blatten, said some 400,000 cubic meters of rock and ice remains unstable atop the mountain, making for delicate work in the warmer summer and fall months. The snowfall and cool temperatures have helped solidify the rock and ice overhead, lowering the risks, but frozen ground will make digging harder.",
      "\u201cThe movements are declining,\u201d he said on a hillside overlooking the snow-covered mud cone, referring to the shifting geology that set off the landslide. \"We are looking at next spring with a bit of concern: The whole process will take place the other way around. When the snow melts, a lot of water gets back into the rock.\u201d",
      "Ebener says several years of clearing work, followed by construction of a new village, should pave the way for inhabitants of Blatten to go back by 2030. In the meantime, the villagers \u2014 and much of Switzerland \u2014 must brace for a new reality: That global warming may be leaving its trace.",

      "China's promise to delay its newest restrictions on the export of the rare earths that are crucial to many high-tech products for one year as part of a trade agreement President Donald Trump secured creates an opportunity for the U.S. and its allies to bolster their own production and processing capabilities. But it will be hard to undercut China's stranglehold on the market.",
      "The restrictions China imposed on rare earths this year have been a key issue in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Trump responded angrily to China's latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.",
      "This week's deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.",
      "These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles and robots to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world\u2019s rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China\u2019s new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn\u2019t change the broader strategic picture, and it's important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.",
      "\u201cThis move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,\u201d Mukherjee said. \"This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.\u201d",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies. The Pentagon agreed to invest $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials and promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.",
      "Ian Lange, who is an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines, said he thinks the U.S. and its allies can make significant progress in a year\u2019s time to lessen China\u2019s dominance of the rare earths market.",
      "There are a number of promising efforts already underway. Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year. And starting next year MP also plans to begin processing the heavy rare earths China had restricted in the spring at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California.",
      "And Lange said that other efforts to recycle rare earths and begin producing them as byproducts at existing steel and zirconium mines may also start to pay off. The United States\u2019 recent agreement with Australia will also help provide additional materials to counter China.",
      "China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a resolution Thursday that would undo many of President Donald Trump's tariffs around the globe, the latest note of displeasure at his trade tactics in Washington that came just as the president celebrated his negotiations with China as a success.",
      "After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would in turn purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiation would secure \u201cprosperity and security to millions of Americans.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, senators \u2014 several from Trump's Republican Party \u2014 have demonstrated their dissent with Trump's tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP.",
      "The latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump's tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is \u201cstill much higher than we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "\"It still will lead to increased prices,\" he said.",
      "The votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new law that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won't ultimately take effect.",
      "But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues.",
      "\u201cAmerican families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that \u201cin many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,\u201d and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Overall there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump's import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution.",
      "Those four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil, but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 American farmers welcomed China's promise to buy some of their soybeans, but they cautioned this won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with soaring prices for fertilizer, tractors, repair parts and seeds.",
      "The Chinese promise to buy at least 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually for next three years will bring their purchases back in line with where they were before President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China in the spring. But the 12 million metric tons that China plans to buy between now and January is only about half the typical annual volume.",
      "\u201cThis is a very good thing. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d said Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt, who is a director with the United Soybean Board. \"I don\u2019t want to sound like a ungrateful farmer, but it doesn\u2019t cure everything in the short term.\u201d",
      "Missouri farmer Bryant Kagay said it\u2019s somewhat \"crazy\u201d that everyone is getting so excited about this deal when all it does is get farmers back to where they were before this trade war began.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why you would go to war on trade if you didn\u2019t expect you could get a better outcome in the end,\u201d said Kagay, who is part owner of Kagay Farms in Amity, Missouri,",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China also agreed to remove all its retaliatory tariffs on American ag products, which should open the door for sales of other crops and beef. Plus, China promised to resume buying U.S. sorghum, which is another crop largely used for animal feed that depends on that market. More than half the sorghum and soybean crops are exported every year with much of that going to China.",

      "Trump had promised to offer farmers a significant aid package this fall to help them survive the trade war with China, but it's been put on hold because of the ongoing government shutdown.

      "China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. It had been consistently buying about one quarter of the American crop in recent years. China bought more than $12.5 billion worth of the nearly $24.5 billion worth of U.S. soybeans that were exported last year.",
      "China quit buying American soybeans this year after Trump imposed his tariffs. Yet it had been steadily shifting more of its purchases to Brazil and other South American nations over the past decade.",
      "Last year, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China\u2019s imports, while the U.S. share fell to 21%, World Bank data shows. Argentina and other South American countries also are selling more to China, which has diversified to boost food security.",

      "NEW YORK -- The United States is running out of pennies.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is starting to have real implications for the nation\u2019s commerce. Merchants in multiple regions of the country have run out of pennies and are unable to produce exact change. Meanwhile, banks are unable to order fresh pennies and are rationing pennies for their customers.",
      "One convenience store chain, Sheetz, got so desperate for pennies that it briefly ran a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies. Another retailer says the lack of pennies will end up costing it millions this year, because of the need to round down to avoid lawsuits.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chunk of change,\u201d said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation.",
      "The penny problem started in late summer and is only getting worse as the country heads into the holiday shopping season.",
      "To be sure, not one retailer or bank has called for the penny to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and are more often than not used exclusively to give customers change. But the abrupt decision to get rid of the penny has come with no guidance from the federal government. Many stores have been left pleading for Americans to pay in exact change.",
      "\u201cWe have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\u201d said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "Trump announced on Feb. 9 that the U.S. would no longer mint pennies, citing the high costs. Both the penny and the nickel have been more expensive to produce than they are worth for several years, despite efforts by the U.S. Mint to reduce costs. The Mint spent 3.7 cents to make a penny in 2024, according to its most recent annual report, and it spends 13.8 cents to make a nickel.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s rip the waste out of our great nation\u2019s budget, even if it\u2019s a penny at a time,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted and by August, those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\u201cWe got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that\u2019s it.",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.23 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change, and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",

      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\u201cAs a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\u201d a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers and debit and credit card customers on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "So, to avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, says it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel. That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "A bill currently pending in Congress, known as the Common Cents Act, calls for cash transactions to be rounded to the nearest nickel, up or down. While the proposal is palatable to businesses, rounding up could be costly for consumers.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "The United States is not the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later.

      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Thursday pledged to strengthen ties between the neighbors, whose relations have long been strained by their bitter wartime history",
      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi met in their first summit Thursday, pledging to strengthen ties that have been frequently strained by their bitter wartime history.",
      "Their meeting in South Korea came after both launched charm offensives toward U.S. President Donald Trump, who visited their countries and pressed the two key U.S. allies to complete their massive U.S. investment pledges.",
      "Meeting with Takaichi ahead of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, Lee said South Korea and Japan share common challenges in the face of \u201crapidly changing international dynamics and trade conditions\u201d and that their future-oriented cooperation was more important than ever.",
      "Takaichi said trilateral cooperation between Tokyo, Seoul and Washington is becoming increasingly crucial \u201cunder the current strategic environment,\u201d according to Lee\u2019s office.",
      "The two leaders agreed to continue their \u201cshuttle diplomacy,\u201d in which they take turns hosting summits, Lee\u2019s office said in a statement.",
      "Takaichi described her first talks with Lee as \u201cvery enjoyable and meaningful\" and that she believes \u201cwe will welcome (Lee) in Japan next time.\u201d",
      "The Oct. 22 election of Takaichi raised concern in Seoul about a potential deterioration in ties, as South Koreans view her right-wing views on history as hawkish. She has resisted acknowledging Japanese aggression in World War II and atrocities and denied that coercion was used against Korean laborers and women held as sexual slaves for Japanese troops.",
      "But many experts say Seoul and Tokyo will more likely continue to tighten cooperation as they both struggle to defend their economic interests in face of Trump\u2019s unilateral push to reset global trade. They also face other common challenges like supply chain vulnerabilities and North Korea's nuclear program.",

In return, they say the Americans have agreed to lower tariffs on Korean vehicles and auto parts from 25% to 15%.

Growth in the 20 countries that use the euro was held by back higher U.S. tariffs and anemic performances by Germany and Italy, both of which barely avoided a technical recession.",

You can recognize the spin and you can still have a pretty ugly swing on it if the metrics are right.\u201d",

      "Usage dropped after the pitch gained a reputation for causing elbow injuries. Just 1.4% of regular-season pitches were splitters when tracking started. The percentage climbed to 2.2% in 2023, 3.1% in 2024 and 3.3% this year.",
      "\u201cGoing back a few years, I think certain people thought they couldn\u2019t throw it, they couldn\u2019t actually get their fingers wide enough,\u201d Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \u201cPitch design has changed, and I think guys have figured out different ways to grip it, like, Gaus\u2019s is different than Trey\u2019s, Trey\u2019s is different than Seranthony\u2019s, Yariel\u2019s is different than -- they all hold it a little bit differently. So I think pitchers have just gotten to the point where they understand that pitch works against certain swing types that are pretty prevalent in the league and they figured out ways to kind of manipulate to get the same action.\u201d",

      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",

The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple's iPhone sales growth decelerated during its summertime quarter, but the company still delivered financial results that exceeded analyst projections while the trendsetting company continued to catch up to its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "The performance announced Thursday was driven largely by strong initial demand for the premium models of the iPhone 17 lineup that went on sale last month.",

      "Apple also largely maintained its pricing on its latest iPhones, despite being squeezed by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war that imposed tariffs on the U.S. devices that the company mostly makes in India and China.",
      "The formula apparently was enough to win over consumers, particularly in the United States, and deliver iPhone sales totaling $49 billion during the July-September period, a 6% from the same time last year. That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

The rally catapulted Apple\u2019s market value above $4 trillion for the first time earlier this week and now the stage is set for the shares to hit another new high during Friday's regular trading session.",

      "Apple had promised a wide array of AI features would be rolling out on last year\u2019s iPhone models, but was only able to deliver a few of them. The missing upgrades included a smarter and more versatile version of its frequently flummoxed Siri virtual assistant \u2013 a makeover that Apple now doesn\u2019t expect to complete until next year.",

      "Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are developing tiny drones inspired by bats for search and rescue missions",
      "WORCESTER, Mass. -- Don't be fooled by the fog machine, spooky lights and fake bats: the robotics lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute lab isn't hosting a Halloween party.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "The excavation project itself began after artifacts began appearing on the beach around 2007. Part of the site that washed out had been excavated previously.",

      "When he left in July, there was a roughly 30-foot buffer to the sea. The storm took out the buffer and another 30 feet of the site, he said. It also left what Knecht described as piano-sized clumps of tundra on the tidal flats.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google\u2019s corporate parent on Wednesday announced its first-ever quarter with more than $100 billion in revenue, a milestone that illustrates the unwavering power of its internet empire amid legal and competitive threats.",
      "The news of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s accelerating growth in revenue and profit comes on the heels of a court ruling in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s landmark monopoly case against Google\u2019s dominant search engine that was widely seen as a mild rebuke that wouldn\u2019t hobble the company.",
      "Alphabet performed like a powerhouse during the July-September period, delivering a profit of nearly $35 billion, or $2.87 per share, a 33% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% from last year to $102.3 billion. Both figures easily exceeded the analysts' projections that steer the stock market.",

      "That\u2019s on top of a 30% surge in Alphabet\u2019s shares that has created nearly $770 billion in stockholder wealth since early September. That\u2019s when U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected a Justice Department proposal to break up Google to curb the abuses of a search engine that was declared an illegal monopoly last year.",
      "Mehta\u2019s cautious handling of Google\u2019s search monopoly largely reflected his belief that rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology have already been spawning conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d from rising tech stars such as ChatGPT and Perplexity that are giving consumers more options.",

      "Producing and manufacturing electric vehicles and their batteries uses a lot of energy, leading many to be skeptical about the environmental benefits of going electric",
      "DETROIT -- Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.",
      "The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.",
      "The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.",
      "\u201cWhile there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you\u2019re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,\" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.",
      "The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.",
      "Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.",
      "They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest \u2014 a 31% share of vehicle sales \u2014 to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)",
      "The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.",
      "The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is \u201cnot only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,\u201d said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.",
      "Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, called it a \u201cvaluable study\u201d that echoes other findings and \u201cconfirms the environmental and economic benefits\u201d of EVs.",
      "\u201cAccelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.",
      "\u201cWhen you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody\u2019s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.\"",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",

      "China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys have joined pandas as diplomatic envoys to Europe",
      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",
      "Another trio of golden monkeys arrived at the Pairi Daiza zoo in Hainaut, Belgium, in May. The zoo distributed Belgian and Chinese hand flags to visitors on the day the monkeys arrived.",
      "After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. So far, they appear to be in good health, according to the two zoos, adapting to new climates outside Asia for the first time.",
      "At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs.",
      "\u201cThe diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,\u201d said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.",
      "The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Ana\u00efs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.",
      "The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs \u201csimilar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,\u201d Maury said.",
      "Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary\u2019s College of California.",
      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",
      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",
      "The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world\u2019s first Communist state.",
      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "The world's two largest economies appeared to dial back a monthslong trade war.",
      "A short-term agreement struck between the U.S. and China early Thursday appeared to dial back a monthslong trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, carrying implications for everyone from smartphone buyers to soybean farmers.",
      "The deal came after a high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first in-person gathering of the two leaders since Trump took office for his second term.",
      "Some trade experts who spoke with ABC News indicated both sides had won notable concessions, though the ultimate impact may depend on whether the agreement can withstand mercurial US-China relations.",
      "Trump said Thursday the 20% tariffs on China related to fentanyl were being reduced to 10%, bringing the total effective tax rate on Chinese imports from 57% to 47%.",
      "The one-year agreement also addresses other issues, such as U.S. access to critical rare earth minerals and the Chinese soybean market, Trump said. The fate of social media platform TikTok remains unclear after the deal, but a thaw in tensions could influence a potential sale, some experts said.",
      "\u201cThis is progress,\u201d Kaiser Kuo, the host of \"Sinica Podcast,\" a U.S.-based podcast on current affairs in China, told ABC News. \u201cWhether it will endure is yet to be seen.\u201d",
      "Rare earth minerals",
      "Beijing said it would delay imposing dramatic restrictions on rare earth minerals -- key materials for the production of computer chips necessary for goods ranging from smartphones to AI to defense technology.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed the temporary suspension of those restrictions in an official readout. Trump said he believes the one-year deal will be \"routinely\" extended.",
      "China dominates global production of rare earths, accounting for roughly 60% of rare earth mining and about 90% of processing capacity, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "If China had moved forward with the threatened restrictions, the policy would have hamstrung U.S. production in key sectors, Dennis Wilder, a professor at Georgetown University and former official on the White House\u2019s National Security Council, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese backdown here is real,\u201d Wilders added, but he cautioned that yet-to-be-seen details of the commitment would determine whether U.S. access to rare earth minerals ends up fully restored.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is highly dependent and will be for a number of years still,\u201d Wilders said, estimating that it would take between 5 and 10 years for the U.S. to establish a domestic supply of rare earth minerals.",
      "Soybean farmers",
      "Trump also said Xi had \"authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products.\"",
      "On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that China had agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from U.S. farmers this year, as well as at least 25 million metric tons over each of the next three years. Such volume would return Chinese soybean purchases to annual levels recorded prior to recent trade tensions.",

      "Joe Janzen, a professor at the University of Illinois and its FarmDoc project, said the agreement could ease a major fear among U.S. soybean farmers about a continued loss of Chinese purchases and the drop in soybean prices that would have ensued.",
      "\u201cThe concern has been about expectations of the future and how things could get worse,\u201d Janzen said. \u201cThis agreement realizes what some people in the trade were thinking: There\u2019s got to be a resolution to this conflict that means we shouldn\u2019t see dramatically lower prices for soybeans.\u201d",
      "But, Janzen cautioned: \u201cThe market still has to process to what degree it thinks this is really binding in the medium and long run.\u201d He noted China\u2019s failure to fulfill the terms of a commitment on soybean purchases hatched out in a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal reached during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "TikTok",
      "Last month, Trump announced an agreement that would pave the way for social media giant TikTok to come under the control of a group of U.S. investors.",
      "Ahead of the meeting on Wednesday, China had not provided public approval of the deal, leaving the fate of a potential U.S.-based TikTok uncertain. China continued to withhold its approval after the summit, saying only that it would collaborate with the U.S. to \u201cproperly address\u201d the topic.",
      "Still, Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that China had \u201cfinalized\u201d its approval in recent days.",
      "\u201cI would expect that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that,\" Bessent added.",
      "The potential end to the standoff comes 10 months after a ban on the China-based app was set to take effect in January. Instead, Trump delayed the ban multiple times, while assuring app stores and server companies that they would not face penalties in the meantime.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who has closely tracked the TikTok ban, said he would await a firm, detailed agreement before weighing in on whether TikTok had complied with the divestiture required to lift the ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so chaotic that until there's a signed piece of paper, somewhere I\u2019ll wait to have an opinion,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "Scrutiny has centered on the fate of TikTok's algorithm, a proprietary formula that fuels the attention-grabbing social media platform. U.S. critics have raised concern about potential Chinese manipulation of the content feed if the algorithm remains under the ownership of a China-based company.",
      "Wilder, of Georgetown, said the algorithm may be a sticking point in the TikTok sale, since the Chinese view the algorithm as valuable intellectual property while some U.S. officials consider it a critical part of any agreement.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that one side will have to give on this issue and so far neither side has shown a willingness to do that,\u201d Wilder said.",

      "A U.S. Senate investigation has uncovered numerous credible reports of medical neglect and poor conditions in immigration detention centers across the country",
      "A U.S. Senate investigation has uncovered dozens of credible reports of medical neglect and poor conditions in immigration detention centers nationwide \u2014 with detainees denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water \u2014 raising scrutiny about how the government oversees its vast detention system.",
      "The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.",
      "The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.",
      "The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.",
      "A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that \u201cambulances have to come almost every day,\u201d according to the report.",
      "Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.",
      "\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,\u201d Ossoff told The Associated Press. \u201cEvery human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.\u201d",
      "The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.",
      "The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.",
      "The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report's findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff's first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to \u201cscore political points.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they've seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.",

      "Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization's clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola's Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.",
      "Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.",
      "\u201cHe still could not walk by himself,\" she said. \u201cHe still had paralysis on his left side.\u201d She added: \u201cHe was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn't able to get up.\u201d",
      "Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he's been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.",
      "Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Dagen said several of the organization's clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.",
      "But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it's much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.",
      "\u201cWhat we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,\" Dagen said. \u201cWe would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.\u201d",
      "Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren't always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.",
      "\u201cThis is 100% a problem of their own making,\u201d she said of the authorities. \u201cThese hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical \u2026 fully knowing they don\u2019t have the ability to hold these people.\u201d",

The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\u201d",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \u201cairstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An investigation by The Associated Press and Cox Media Group Television Stations found that school crossing guards face dangerous conditions, with many injured or killed on the job",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anthony Taylor will never forget the look of horror on the student\u2019s face. The school crossing guard was walking into the crosswalk in front of Washington Township High School in Indianapolis when a car with a young boy and his mom, who was dropping him off at school, suddenly appeared. The mom's eyes grew wide, and the boy began vigorously hitting on his mother\u2019s chest.",
      "\u201cNext thing, it was boom, lights out. That\u2019s all I remember,\u201d Taylor said. He woke up in the hospital hours after undergoing surgery for a fractured pelvis and other broken bones.",
      "In many ways, Taylor was lucky. Despite the broken bones and the pins and metal plates to heal his body from that August 2018 collision, he returned to work.",
      "Across the country, school crossing guards like Taylor, who stand in the cold, rain or heat to protect children, face the risk of injuries from drivers who may be distracted or in a hurry.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press and Cox Media Group Television Stations found that over the past 10 years, hundreds of school crossing guards \u2014 many of them of retirement age or older -- have suffered injuries on the job after being hit by a vehicle, and dozens of them have died.",
      "A full accounting is impossible. No federal agencies and just two states track how many crossing guards are injured or killed each year. And local police accident reports often have no code to distinguish between school crossing guards and other pedestrians hit near schools.",
      "\u201cOfficers rarely stop to consider whether the injured \u2018pedestrian\u2019 was on duty.\u201d said former Cornelius, North Carolina, Police Chief Bence Hoyle.",
      "A database compiled by AP and Cox Media Group shows that 230 school crossing guards across 37 states and Washington, DC, were struck by vehicles. Nearly three dozen were killed in these collisions. The cases, compiled from incident and accident reports requested from nearly 200 police departments, represent only a portion of guards injured and killed nationwide.",
      "The investigation shows that in these cases, drivers who hit or even kill crossing guards rarely face serious consequences. Of the incidents involving 183 crossing guards where an outcome could be determined, nearly half resulted in traffic citations \u2014 such as \u201cfailure to yield to a pedestrian.\u201d About a quarter of the drivers weren\u2019t ticketed at all, while just over a quarter faced criminal charges. Police said several factors go into whether or not a driver who hits a crossing guard is charged, including things such as weather conditions or negligence by the person operating the vehicle.",
      "Taken as a whole, these incidents highlight a largely underreported problem: Crossing guards, tasked with protecting children as they navigate busy streets in front of schools, can be casualties of dangerous roadways.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge responsibility to step out in front of a vehicle,\u201d said Dacia Maisonave, a crossing guard trainer in Seminole County, Florida. \u201cIt is unfortunate that our crossing guards don\u2019t have a lot of laws. The only thing they really have to protect them is the stop paddle.\u201d",
      "The lack of a system to track injuries and deaths of crossing guards has hampered efforts to develop better safety measures or even assess just how dangerous the job is, experts say. School crossing guard protection remains a patchwork of state and local policies.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes survey data for on-the-job injuries and deaths across most industries, but school crossing guards are included in a job category with road construction flaggers \u2014 and the agency does not publish a fatality rate for it.",
      "The AP calculated its own fatality rates for nearly 200 job classifications with at least 10,000 workers and 10 deaths in 2023, the most recent year of available records. Crossing guards and flaggers were in the top fifth of deadliest jobs, the AP\u2019s analysis found, on par with power line installers and air transportation workers. It\u2019s the only occupation in that top fifth that interacts with children daily.",
      "Other federal agencies also rarely capture details specific to school crossing guards\u2019 injuries or deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s records on fatal accidents specify whether a school bus was involved or the crash happened within a designated school zone. But no information is captured about whether a victim was a crossing guard.",
      "Very few accident reports filed through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration mention school crossing guards.",
      "Only two states have made a serious effort to track crossing guard safety: New Jersey and Massachusetts.",
      "After examining the deaths of 16 crossing guards struck by motor vehicles and more than 230 injuries between 1993 and 2008, the New Jersey Department of Health launched a program aimed at crossing guard safety in February.",
      "Officials in New Jersey said they target school zones for recurring safety inspections and have already issued eight serious violations and 30 others to employers for noncompliance. But even this pioneering effort faces limitations.",
      "\u201cSince there are no crossing guard standards in New Jersey, there is only so much we can do but to make sure they have appropriate training,\u201d says Assistant State Labor Commissioner Justin Baker.",
      "New Jersey state officials said they work with local police to provide training and proper equipment, including reflective vests.",
      "Michael Flanagan, director of the Department of Labor Standards in Massachusetts, said his state began tracking school crossing guard injuries and deaths when a guard was fatally struck in 2012. In 2022, he said the state mandated that cities and towns report crossing guard injuries.",
      "Labor experts say more can be done to make the job safer. Among possible solutions that remain underused in the U.S, experts say, are installing smart crosswalk systems with flashing LED lights, raised crosswalks, automated speed cameras or requiring all guards to wear high-visibility gear.",
      "Flanagan said ultimately the most effective measure for protecting cross guards from injuries and deaths comes from talking to and educating motorists.",
      "\u201cCrossing guards are out there, and just slow down and be aware of that and look out for them,\u201d he said.",
      "School crossing guards are employed by local police departments, school districts or private companies hired by schools. Many of them are older adults or retirees \u2014 of the 160 cases where AP and Cox Media Group were able to document ages, more than half were older than 65.",
      "In interviews, many guards say they enjoy their jobs. But they also recount almost daily close calls with hurried and distracted drivers who ignore posted warning signs and the guards themselves, even in crosswalks.",
      "Travis Callis, a former crossing guard in Martinsburg, West Virginia, said while he\u2019s never been hurt, he\u2019s had several close run-ins, including an instance where a car was so close he could feel its heat on the back of his legs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m holding the sign up and they\u2019re just driving at me,\u201d he said.",
      "In some cases, collisions can kill.",
      "Last year, Stanley Brucker, 61, was working as a crossing guard at Fort Mill Elementary School in South Carolina when he was struck by a car as he was holding a stop sign and directing traffic.",
      "Video captured by a passing school bus shows a vehicle hitting Brucker and flipping him over the car as he stands in the crosswalk. He was transported to a nearby hospital but later died.",
      "Brucker was the fourth crossing guard to be hit or killed while working for the school district. His death caused many of the district's crossing guards to refuse to show up for two days after they learned the driver who hit him wouldn\u2019t face charges.",
      "\u201cThere is no indication that the driver of the vehicle was driving in a dangerous or reckless manner,\u201d local prosecutors in the 16th Circuit Solicitor\u2019s Office said in a statement at the time.",
      "Brucker\u2019s family sees it differently and has filed a lawsuit against the school district and the driver who struck him.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the Fort Mill School District of choosing locations for crossing guards that were not \u201creasonably safe,\u201d citing \u201cthe actual conditions on the site in the middle of a busy highway and by the numerous past instances of injury to crossing guards.\u201d No trial date has been set for the case to be heard.",
      "In response to questions about the lawsuit, a spokesperson for the district wrote: \u201cIn light of the pending litigation, in which the actions of traffic guards employed by the company providing guards to the district is an issue, the district, on advice of counsel, is unable to respond further.\u201d The Fort Mill School District and the driver who hit Brukcer have both asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Before the start of this school year, district officials informed parents that public schools in Fort Mill will not have traffic guards. The district has installed a new traffic system to help improve safety in the absence of traffic guards.",
      "Rutledge Young, an attorney in Charleston, South Carolina, representing Brucker\u2019s family, said Brucker was doing what he was told to do.",

      "Police said the incident was not a result of speeding or impairment, but environmental conditions. The driver was given various traffic citations, but no criminal charges were filed.",
      "Kevin VanFleet, a detective in the Simi Valley Police Department in California, said each collision must be looked at individually. He said several factors go into deciding if a driver is going to be charged, including what police -- who rarely witness the accident -- find during their investigation and whether local prosecutors feel charges are warranted.",
      "\u201cNot everybody that is involved in a collision, let\u2019s say, with a pedestrian in a crosswalk, or perhaps a crossing guard in a crosswalk, is going to receive an infraction ticket. It depends on the severity of it,\u201d VanFleet said",
      "One common explanation for drivers hitting crossing guards that emerges from a review of traffic and incident reports is the glare of sunlight.",
      "\u201cThe sun was in my eyes,\u201d appears repeatedly in reports obtained by AP and Cox Media Group.",
      "Last year, Patricia Davis, a guard in Monroe County, Georgia, about an hour east of Atlanta, was hit by a truck while helping students cross.",
      "The driver told law enforcement that the sun was directly in his eyes, and he didn\u2019t see Davis until his truck struck her. Davis was taken to the hospital after suffering minor injuries. The driver was not charged. Police labeled the collision an accident.",

The driver, who was not charged, told police that sunlight blinded him, and he never saw Peavy.",
      "Crossing guards said these cases and dozens more like them highlight how drivers rarely face serious consequences when one of them is severely injured or killed.",
      "Beyond distracted drivers and the glare of sunlight, experts point to multiple other factors that compromise crossing guard safety.",
      "The higher hoods of today\u2019s SUVs and trucks create larger blind spots that reduce visibility. Many school zones lack adequate traffic-slowing measures like speed bumps or automated enforcement cameras. And many local roads are designed to prioritize vehicle flow over pedestrian safety and have inadequate sight lines and insufficient buffer zones around crosswalks.",
      "Still, former Police Chief Hoyle in North Carolina said drivers should be held accountable for injuring or killing crossing guards. He suggests raising speeding tickets in school zones to $1,000 and implementing license plate recognition systems to track down reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cThe penalties should be much higher, making drivers think twice about speeding through a school zone,\u201d Hoyle said.",
      "VanFleet, the Simi Valley Police Department detective in California, said greater police presence in school zones would likely be more effective than fines.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the cost of the infraction it would be that would cause a deterrence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be having more officers out there doing more enforcement.",
      "Among the incidents where AP and Cox Media Group could determine an outcome, around a quarter resulted in criminal charges. About 40% of those criminal charges occurred when the driver fled the scene.",

      "They are also pushing their employers to provide items they think will make the job safer, such as body cameras, which some have already bought with their own money.",
      "The guards said they would also like to see increased police supervision in school zones and license plate recognition systems to help police spot bad drivers.",

      "Mid-cycle congressional redistricting efforts could move forward Friday in two more states amid growing maneuvering to influence which party will control the U.S. House after next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "A Republican-controlled Ohio commission is meeting to consider a proposed map that could give the GOP a chance at winning two more seats. Meanwhile, senators in the Democrat-led Virginia General Assembly are expected to vote on advancing a proposed constitutional amendment that would let them temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage.",
      "Their scheduled vote comes after the Virginia House passed the same resolution on Wednesday. President Donald Trump kicked off the redistricting fray this summer by urging Republican-led states to redraw voting districts ahead of next year\u2019s congressional elections. Republicans in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina already have done so. Voters in Democratic-led California are deciding on new districts.",
      "In Ohio, the map proposed by the commission appears to increase Republican chances in districts held by Democratic U.S. Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur around Toledo, an area that voted for Trump in last year's presidential election. Kaptur won a 22nd term last fall by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, while Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.",
      "If the Ohio commission fails to adopt a map, the job goes to the Republican-led Legislature, which could enact a map designed to bolster the size of the state's GOP congressional delegation, now with a 10-5 Republican majority.",
      "In Virginia, the proposed constitutional amendment being considered by senators is in its early stages. After Friday, the resolution would need to pass the state Legislature again next year, then go before voters by way of a referendum.",
      "Along with California, Virginia would be one of the few states with a Democratic-led statehouse to enter the national redistricting battle.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a double standard for Democrats in authority that somehow we have to lay down while Donald Trump seizes power that we\u2019ve never seen, and the Republicans run the play,\u201d Virginia House Speaker Don Scott said this week.",
      "Through the constitutional amendment, Virginia\u2019s Legislature would have the power to create a new congressional map only when other states do so between now and 2030. Democrats have not unveiled their planned map.",
      "Asked about whether his party has begun drafting new districts, Scott said: \u201cYou\u2019re not naive.\u201d",
      "The developments come as Virginia has statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.",

He was dismissed Oct. 14 for his \u201clack of leadership and ability to work in alignment with the university's direction for the Student Media Plan,\" according to David Tolchinsky, dean of the university's media school, who also ended the newspaper's print product.",
      "\u201cThe question is if a university doesn't like the content of the student newspaper, can it simply pull the plug on the student newspaper,\u201d Rodenbush's attorney, Jonathan Little, said.",
      "Phone and email messages were left for university spokespersons. The school issued a statement earlier this month saying it was shifting publication from print to digital platforms for educational and financial purposes.",
      "Editors of the Indiana Daily Student announced Thursday that the university backtracked on its decision to cut future print editions for the rest of the school year. Chancellor David Reingold authorized the paper to use its established printing budget through June 30, 2026. The next issue is scheduled to print Nov. 20.",
      "Reingold said Thursday in a letter to the editors of the student paper that he recognizes the university \u201chas not handled recent decisions as well as we should have.\u201d",
      "The chancellor noted that the \u201cpersonnel matter\u201d and the budget-related decision to pause printing fueled a perception that the school was trying to censor editorial content. He reminded editors that the paper is \u201cnot immune to the financial realities of this campus.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: my decision had nothing to do with editorial content of the IDS,\" Reingold said. \u201cAnd contrary to what has been posted on social media and published, Indiana University has never attempted to censor editorial content, period.\u201d",
      "In their own letter Thursday, student editors Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller disagreed with the chancellor, saying the administration\u2019s actions constituted censorship.",
      "Subsidized by $250,000 a year because of dwindling ad revenue, the Indiana Daily Student, regularly honored as among the nation's best collegiate news organizations, had its weekly print editions reduced to seven special sections a year. Rodenbush said this fall, administrators questioned why the special sections still had hard news content.",

      "A briefing held only for Republicans in Congress on U.S. military strikes is drawing a fierce rebuke from a key Democrat",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s increasing efforts to exclude Democrats from national security briefings could endanger troops and keep important information from the public, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee warned Thursday.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you even begin to rebuild trust,\u201d Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said after Democrats were not invited to a briefing this week on U.S. military strikes against boats alleged to be carrying drugs. \u201cThis is against every norm of how national security policy has worked.\u201d",
      "Every senator should be read in, Warner said, and \u201cwhen you politicize decision making about putting service members in harm's way, you make them less safe.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers in both parties have had questions about the American strikes on boats in the waters off South America \u2014 14 strikes so far, killing 61 people \u2014 and the legal justification for them, given that Congress has not authorized military action. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration also has been building up an unusually large force of warships in the region, fueling speculation that the moves are aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The Senate could have a say next week with an expected vote on a war powers resolution forced by Democrats that would prohibit strikes in or near Venezuela, unless Congress approves. Several Republicans who are considered potential swing votes in favor of that resolution were part of the briefing this week.",
      "One of those Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, said he had requested the briefing along with others. He said it helped ease some of his concerns, but that he\u2019s going to \u201ccontinue to look at\u201d the resolution.",
      "Tillis said that he saw nothing wrong with Republicans having their own briefing since the issue has become \u201cpoliticized.\u201d But Democrats \u201cshould be entitled to a briefing\u201d as well, Tillis said.",
      "Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also said Democrats should hear from the administration. Asked if he\u2019s worried about the precedent being set by excluding them, Graham responded that \u201cthey\u2019ll get briefed.\u201d",
      "Warner said that is \u201cbull\u2014--.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomebody needs to be held accountable for this,\u201d he said. \u201cSome \u2018oops\u2019 makeup session doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d",
      "Warner has criticized the Trump administration for months as military and intelligence officials have increasingly moved away from the long tradition of bipartisan briefings in the Capitol and cracked down on access to national security information.",
      "Trump officials only called Republicans in Congress, not Democrats, before launching strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this year. They also canceled a routine classified meeting that Warner had scheduled with career intelligence staffers at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency after it was criticized by Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist.",

      "\u201cSomebody should have walked out of the meeting,\u201d Warner said.",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, another Republican who attended the briefing, said he did not know until he arrived that it would be partisan. He said he received a phone call from the White House on Thursday morning inquiring about whether he had concerns.",

      "The Chinese promise to buy at least 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually for next three years will bring their purchases back in line with where they were at before President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China in the spring. But the 12 million metric tons that China plans to buy between now and January is only about half the typical annual volume.",
      "\u201cThis is a very good thing. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d said Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt, who is a director with the United Soybean Board. \"I don\u2019t want to sound like a ungrateful farmer, but it doesn\u2019t cure everything in the short term.\u201d",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China also agreed to remove all its retaliatory tariffs on American ag products, which should open the door for sales of other crops and beef.

More than half the sorghum and soybean crops are exported every year with much of that going to China.",

      "Trump had promised to offer farmers a significant aid package this fall to help them survive the trade war with China, but it's been put on hold because of the ongoing government shutdown.

Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.",
      "\u201cI thought I had died. I thought I was either on my way to heaven or in heaven,\u201d Zwerner testified. \"But then it all got black. And so, I then thought I wasn\u2019t going there. And then my next memory is I see two co-workers around me and I process that I\u2019m hurt and they\u2019re putting pressure on where I\u2019m hurt.\u201d",
      "The shooting sent shock waves through the military shipbuilding community and the country, with many wondering how a child so young could access a gun and shoot his teacher.",

The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",

    "summary": "Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" about his inspiration for his latest project and his perspective on life after being involved in a terrifying car crash over a decade ago.",
    "story": [
      "Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan's love for family is what drew him to his latest project \u2013 starring in the new Paramount+ comedy series \"Crutch.\"",
      "Morgan plays Frank Crutchfield, a widowed father of two adult kids who move back into the family home in New York City's Harlem. It's a spinoff of the hit CBS show \"The Neighborhood.\"",
      "\"Prepping my whole life, man. I've got kids. My real wife died, Sabina. She passed away eight years ago. I \u2026 knew this role. I know this guy,\" Morgan said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Wednesday.",
      "Morgan's ex-wife Sabina, who was his high school sweetheart, died of cancer in 2016.",
      "\"I was with her in the hospital the day she closed her eyes and I said, 'I love you. I miss you and please forgive me for any hurt I've ever caused you and I will see you again.'\"",
      "Purpose in his work",
      "For Morgan, he says it's important to not just be funny, but also send a message in his work.",
      "\"If it doesn't have a heart, I don't want to do it,\" he said. \"I need to be motivated. I got to say something. You got to tell life how I see it.\"",
      "Humor has helped the comedian through some of life's most demanding moments, all while he built one of comedy's most impressive resumes. Morgan found comfort in commanding an audience, standing out in everything he put his fingers on, including \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "\"When I first got there, I felt socially pushed away,\" he said. \"Because it is like the whitest show in the world and I didn't want no one to portray me in a way that wasn't true. It was like I had the whole Black community on my back.\"",
      "Morgan said then he had a conversation with the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels, which changed everything.",
      "\"Lorne let me know, 'Tracy, we didn't hire you because you're Black. We hired you because you're funny,' and that changed it all. That's when I let go and I let God,\" he said.",
      "Car crash impact on his life",
      "In June 2014, at the height of his fame, Morgan nearly lost his life after his limousine was hit by a tractor trailer. His friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash.",
      "Morgan was in a coma for two weeks with a traumatic brain injury and broken bones.",
      "\"I just thank the Lord that I'm alive and I'm here and \u2026 I move on,\" he said.",
      "Morgan said he is now thriving with a renewed outlook on forgiveness and a focus on being present.",
      "\"The man almost killed me in that Walmart truck. I forgave him. As soon as I came out the coma, I forgave him,\" he said.",
      "For Morgan, forgiveness is the key to moving forward, but adds you don't have to forget.",
      "\"I wouldn't have been able to be funny no more. I would have been too angry. He almost killed me. I forgave him just to move forward with my life. Now look at me. I'm funnier than ever,\" he added.",
      "After the terrifying experience, Morgan says his perspective on life evolved: \"You have to cherish it. Cause once it's done, it's done.\"",

      "He added that Turner, \"always knew what she wanted. She would say, 'oh that's too old fashioned, I\u00a0 can't wear that.' Then she would put it on and go, 'oh. Well, that's pretty good.'\"",
      "Now some of Mackie's iconic designs are headed for auction in December.",
      "\"It's OK. I don't have it at home waiting for me. It's just there and the girls kind of like seeing somebody else wear it. That's fun,\" he said.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

      "Lockhart died of natural causes at home in Santa Monica, California, with her daughter, June Elizabeth, and granddaughter, Christianna, by her side, her spokesperson said Saturday in a statement.",
      "Her family said in the statement, \"We will miss this truly remarkable woman, mom and grandmama.\"",
      "Born in New York on June 25, 1925, Lockhart was the daughter of Oscar-winning actor Gene Lockhart and actor Kathleen Lockhart. She made her professional debut at age 8, playing Mimsey in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. She later made her screen debut in MGM's version of \"A Christmas Carol\", playing the daughter of her real-life parents in the movie.",
      "Lockhart then went on to play the ing\u00e9nue in the Broadway comedy \"For Love or Money\" with John Loder, winning the Tony in the category of Best Newcomer in 1947. She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.",
      "The actor became a household name to American audiences when she starred as Ruth Martin, the mother in \"Lassie,\" the hit TV show featuring a beloved long-haired collie that aired from 1954 to 1973.",
      "Lockhart would again capture TV audiences in her role as Maureen Robinson, the matriarch in \"Lost in Space,\" a show about a family struggling to survive in a space colony. It ran from 1965 through 1968.",

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "title": "CEO Nicholas Thompson on how running helped him find his footing",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicholas-thompson-on-the-running-ground/",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church!

      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",

      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "A San Antonio, Texas, woman whose husband works for the Department of Defense, told CBS News her family\u00a0is relying on a no-interest loan from the United Services Automobile Association (USAA) to pay the bills while he is furloughed.",
      "The woman, who did not want to be named because of concerns about sharing private financial matters, told CBS News the family took out a $3,200 loan from USAA earlier this month, saying that \"we would have been in trouble\" without the money.",
      "Her predicament highlights the financial challenges many government workers are facing as the stalemate in Congress, now on Day 30, continues. She said that one of her five children, who has special needs, underwent spinal fusion surgery earlier this year. Their health plan covered most, but not all, of the procedure's costs, saddling them with medical bills that are now coming due.",
      "\"Insurance took some time to process it all, and things are starting to come in at a really bad time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Since the shutdown began on October 1, USAA has issued more than $365 million in special loans to over 119,000 federal employees affected by the government shutdown.",
      "\"These are unique, zero-interest, zero-fee loans built specifically to help people meet their essentials during this crisis,\" USAA certified financial planner JJ Montanaro told CBS News.",
      "USAA members can apply for a no-interest loan equal to one net paycheck, for up to $6,000, and have 90 days to repay the loan from its date of issuance, according to the San Antonio-based lender. USAA provides banking services to 14 million members of the military, veterans and their families, and has offices in eight cities.",
      "Paycheck replacement",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal workers missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24, and last received partial paychecks on Oct. 10. Furloughed workers, as well as essential government employees required to work without pay during the shutdown,\u00a0are entitled to back pay once agencies reopen.

      "The credit union's no-interest loans are issued in the amount of members' regular deposits, also up to $6,000. Once workers receive their paychecks again, the amount of the loan will be deducted as repayment.",
      "During a 2018-2019 government shutdown that lasted a record 35 days, Navy Federal issued a total of $53 million in loans to 32,000 recipients. Anne Repczynski, an assistant vice president at the lender, said member enrollment in the financial assistance program has been \"significantly higher\" during the latest shutdown.",

      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",

      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",

      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:52:49 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Treasury Department no longer minting the one-cent coin, some businesses are offering perks to customers who bring in pennies.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Wednesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Canada, a day after the chamber rebuked the president with another vote to block tariffs on Brazil.",
      "In a 50 to 46 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the measure, which would terminate the national emergency used to impose tariffs on some goods from Canada. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with their party to vote in favor of the resolution, which required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "The move is mostly symbolic, since it is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "For months, trade tensions have flared between the U.S. and Canada. In August, the president raised tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods remain exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Then, over the weekend, Mr. Trump said he is raising tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%, blasting the U.S.'s northern neighbor over an anti-tariff ad by the government of Ontario that used quotes from former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more\" to combat \"drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote to challenge the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, effectively bypassing Senate leadership. He has argued that the tariffs on one of the nation's top trading partners aren't justified under the emergency.",
      "\"I don't think you can say that fentanyl is not an emergency vis-a-vis Mexico or China, but it is ridiculous to say that fentanyl is an emergency with respect to Canada,\" Kaine said. \"And it's a pretext that's just being used to pour more and more tariffs onto Canada.\"",
      "The vote came after the Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Wednesday's vote also marked the second time lawmakers have weighed in on the Canada tariffs, after the Senate approved a resolution aimed at blocking the levies in April.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",

      "\"Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\" said the letter, addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the letter when contacted by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

      "But some experts say the center's power demands will raise customers' power bills statewide. The state's main utility company \u2014 Entergy \u2014 agreed to pay for a $550 million transmission line to the center, a cost that experts say will be passed on to the 1.1 million customers under Entergy Louisiana's umbrella. This, in a parish where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, according to the state's utility commission.",
      "That's not the only reason people in Louisiana could see higher utility bills \u2014  state officials who approved the plan admit the increased energy demand from the site could, in turn, increase gas prices.",
      "\"This single data center is set to span an amount of land that is about 70 football fields worth of land, and it's going to consume roughly three times the amount of electricity that the entire city of New Orleans consumes on an annual basis,\" Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, told CBS News.",
      "The Hopkins family showed CBS News their power bills, which indicated the fuel costs on their bill went up by about $13 a month compared to last year.",
      "As the nationwide construction boom in new data centers continues, other communities are already feeling the impacts. Some customers in at least 13 states are seeing higher utility bills because of new data centers, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "\"We're all kind of sharing the pain in that fight,\" Arbaje said. \"It's up to state regulators, really, to step in and protect consumers and make sure that tech companies and utility companies are paying their fair share for this development.\"",
      "Meta's head of community development in North America, Katie Comer, said they're working with Entergy to reduce customer impacts, telling CBS News that Meta has \"invested a million dollars into their bill pay assistance program to support low-income families.\"",
      "Asked about concerns from residents that Meta is imposing on the neighborhood, Comer said, \"We are actively on the ground every day. We want to listen and learn and meet the community where they're at.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",
      "Alan  He and \n                                                  \n                      Grace  Kazarian\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "United Airlines told CBS News that it is helping support essential workers who are going unpaid during the stalemate in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"United is donating meals for air traffic controllers and other federal workers whose pay is delayed. We appreciate the hardworking federal employees who are keeping the air travel system running,\" the airline said in a statement.",
      "United said that it's feeding workers at the airline's hubs across the country, including in Chicago; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.",
      "Delta Air Lines also confirmed to CBS News that it has \"arranged for a limited number of meals for transportation sector workers,\" while noting that it is operating \"within the strict rules established for employees of federal government agencies.\"",
      "American Airlines this week told CBS News that it is also providing meals for air traffic controllers, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at more than seven airports across the country. For example, at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, American sent \"dozens of pizzas\" to air traffic controllers last week, the airline said.",
      "Additionally, JetBlue said it is working with its federal partners, including local aviation officials, \"to offer meals at our airports as a gesture of support.\" The airline said it's working with the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Federal Aviation Administration to coordinate those efforts.",
      "At a press conference on Tuesday at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted air traffic controllers' financial struggles\u00a0as they go without pay.",
      "\"This is day one,\" he said of controllers missing their first full paychecks. \"Day two gets harder, [and] day three is harder after that, as expenses continue to roll [in].\"",
      "Duffy also noted that controllers are calling in sick in larger numbers than usual, as some seek side gigs with companies like\u00a0Uber or DoorDash\u00a0to make ends meet during the shutdown.",
      "Speaking at the same event, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels also emphasized the financial pressure on his members.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "On average this year, 5% of flight delays were attributed to air traffic controller shortages, Duffy said. The personnel shortages at some airports were responsible for roughly 44% of the\u00a08,700 flight delays\u00a0on Sunday, while accounting for 24% of Monday's delays, according to Duffy.",
      "Controllers were planning to gather outside at least 17 airports nationwide on Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"The pressure is real,\" air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes at airports in the New York area, said at the press conference at LaGuardia. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe. We have trainees that are trying to learn a new job that is very fast-paced, very stressful, very complex now having to worry about how they're going to pay bills.\"",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

Their Iowa farm also grows corn and soybeans \u2014 crops that have been hit hard by the trade war with China \u2014 but cattle had been a bright spot so far in 2025.",
      "\"This year, it is the one thing that is going to make any money for us,\" Burleen said.",

      "His words sent wholesale cattle prices plummeting.",
      "\"I thought the whole point of tariffs was to bring production back home, and now he is trying to do something to destroy that production,\" Burleen said, adding, \" It feels like being a pawn in a game we're not going to win.\"",
      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",

That potential aid package is on the back burner due to the shutdown, and is separate from the $3 billion in new assistance, a senior administration official said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record.

      "Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency. Regardless of who wins between the two in November, Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become the Commonwealth's first ever female governor.",
      "The Trump administration's impact on the federal workforce and the ongoing shutdown may also be on voters' minds in the coming days, as they get their say in a contest that historically has been fraught with prospect of serving as a rebuke to the incumbent in the White House.",
      "\"It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4, that we recognize how important it is to have a governor who will stand up for Virginians,\" Spanberger said at a recent event.",
      "State of the race",
      "Spanberger headed into the start of early voting in September with a clear advantage in the contest. That momentum threatened to be impacted, however, by a controversy that has made its way through Virginia politics. She has faced difficult political questions in attempting to respond to violent text messages, authored by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race, about a Republican leader.",
      "\"I'm asking my opponent to please, ask him to get out of the race,\" Earle-Sears said during the lone debate between the two candidates. \"Have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as governor. Well as governor, you have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race.\"",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, which were made public after the start of early voting, where he wrote in the past about a fantasy hypothetical situation involving the shooting of a Virginia state House Republican leader.",
      "Jones however has not left the race, and is still running as the Democratic attorney general candidate in the Nov. 4 election.",
      "That dynamic has provided Virginia Republicans with an issue against Democrats that could alienate moderates and independents at a time where concerns about political violence are rampant. Virginia Democrats are also mounting a last-minute effort to redraw congressional districts in the state to help the left counter Mr. Trump's successful push in a series of red states to undertake an overhaul of district maps in hopes of helping Republicans hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections.",

    "summary": "The United Nations human rights chief says the Trump administration \"must halt\" strikes on alleged drug boats to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014\u00a0The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are \"unacceptable\" and must stop.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.",
      "Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for T\u00fcrk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \"airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\"",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls \"narco-trafficking vessels\" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said\u00a0the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.",
      "The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.",
      "After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed \"drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by \"careful limits\" placed on the use of lethal force.",
      "Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing \"an imminent threat to life,\" she said. \"Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "The strikes are taking place \"outside the context\" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",

      "The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.",

      "The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.",
      "His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Mr. Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.",
      "From coast to coast, fallout from a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.",
      "Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.",

      "The president said he's easing tariffs because China pledged to work with him on the deadly fentanyl crisis. China is the world's largest exporter of the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which has been a longstanding complaint of the president.

    "summary": "Just before meeting with China's Xi Jinping, President Trump announced he had directed the Pentagon to resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries' tests, possibly ending a decades-long U.S. pause that stretches back to the end of the Cold War.",
      "The announcement came moments before Mr. Trump walked into a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.",
      "\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, using his administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"That process will begin immediately.\"",
      "It's not clear when or if the military will carry out a test, or what the president meant by restarting tests \"on an equal basis.\"",
      "The U.S. conducted its last nuclear weapons test in Nevada in 1992. President George H.W. Bush then imposed a moratorium on testing in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "China has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996, and Russia \u2014 or the then-Soviet Union \u2014 hasn't carried out such a test since 1990, though Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country had tested a new nuclear-powered drone, which came shortly after a test of a new nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile.",
      "But China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years, a trend that the Pentagon expects to continue for the rest of the decade.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Xi is expected to primarily focus on trade and tariffs, but security concerns still lurk in the U.S.-China relationship.",
      "The U.S. military is discussing a missile launch this week in a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News reported earlier Wednesday. And some Trump allies have encouraged the U.S. president to recognize Taiwanese independence, a move that Beijing has long viewed as unacceptable.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his dayslong Asia trip to boost relations with U.S. allies in the region like Japan and South Korea, two rivals of China. Earlier Wednesday, he said he will allow South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine.",

      "That unsparing description of the Capitol riot was notable, as Mr. Trump has called Jan. 6 a \"day of love\" and referred to the rioters as \"hostages.\"",

      "Hours after the sentencing memo was submitted, two prosecutors whose names appear on it were placed on leave, CBS News has confirmed. U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch Trump backer, was also listed on the filing.",
      "Then, later Wednesday, a new, shorter sentencing memo appeared in the federal court database with the references to the Jan. 6 riot and Mr. Trump's post about Obama now omitted. Two different federal prosecutors were listed at the bottom of the filing, along with Pirro.",
      "Pirro said in a statement to CBS News: \"While we don't comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\"",
      "\"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 accused and convicted Capitol rioters shortly after returning to the Oval Office earlier this year. The near-blanket pardons drew outrage from Democratic lawmakers and pushback from some federal judges who accused the president of downplaying the event and perpetuating a \"revisionist myth.\"",
      "Taranto is one of several pardon recipients who have faced prosecution for non-Jan. 6 crimes. Earlier this month, a pardoned rioter was charged with allegedly threatening House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Others have been accused of burglary and \"raising a firearm at police.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is urging a federal court to dismiss the two federal charges brought against him over allegedly false testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020. He's arguing that the questions he answered, which were asked by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, were \"confusing\" and \"fundamentally ambiguous.\"",
      "In a new filing with the court in Alexandria, Virginia, Comey's lawyers argued that his testimony in response to Cruz's questions was \"literally true\" and cannot support a conviction. The former FBI director's legal team suggested that the government is attempting to try Comey on \"cherry-picked statements\" given during a four-hour long Senate hearing without specifying which parts of his testimony it believes were false or misleading.",
      "They argued that while the government has the authority to prosecute witnesses who mislead federal investigators by giving false answers to clear questions, \"it does not authorize the government to create confusion by posing an imprecise question and then seek to exploit that confusion by placing an after-the-fact nefarious interpretation on the ensuing benign answer.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers also asserted that \"basic due process principles in criminal law require that the questioner frame his questions with clarity so that a witness does not have to guess.\"",
      "A federal grand jury in Alexandria indicted Comey late last month on charges he lied to Congress and obstructed a congressional investigation. The alleged offenses stem from testimony Comey gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "Comey has already filed\u00a0one tranche of motions with the court that argue the indictment should be tossed out on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and selective prosecution. He is also challenging the validity of interim U.S. Attorney\u00a0Lindsey Halligan's appointment to that role.",
      "Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in one of those filings that he would seek to dismiss at least the first count of the indictment \u2014 the allegation that Comey lied to Congress \u2014 because of Cruz's questioning.",
      "In addition to his latest bid to have the charges dismissed, Comey's lawyers are asking for more details about the conduct underlying the two counts. They are claiming the indictment is \"sparse\" and has a \"total absence of factual allegations.\"",
      "The indictment against Comey references an exchange the former FBI director had with an unnamed senator, believed to be Cruz, during the Judiciary Committee hearing more than five years ago. During the questioning, Cruz asked Comey about testimony he gave in May 2017, in which the former FBI chief was questioned about whether he had ever been an anonymous source or authorized anyone to be an anonymous source about matters relating to investigations into President Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016.",
      "Cruz then referenced comments from Andrew McCabe, who was Comey's deputy at the FBI, and claimed McCabe publicly said that Comey authorized him to leak information to the press.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true; one or the other is false. Who's telling the truth?\" Cruz asked Comey.",
      "Comey said in response, \"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by what, the testimony you summarized that I gave in May of 2017.\"",
      "Cruz reiterated that Comey was testifying that he \"never authorized to leak. And Mr. McCabe when if he says contrary is not telling the truth, is that correct?\"",
      "\"Again, I'm not going to characterize Andy's testimony, but mine is the same today,\" Comey replied.",
      "But prosecutors have claimed that Comey's testimony was false because he authorized Daniel Richman, a longtime friend of his, to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the FBI investigation involving Clinton.",
      "The government confirmed to Comey's lawyers that an unidentified individual referred to as \"Person 3\" in the indictment is Richman. A Columbia University law professor, Richman is a former federal prosecutor who also served as a \"special government employee\" at the FBI when Comey was director.",
      "Richman has not been charged with any wrongdoing. His name also did not come up in the exchange that appears to have led to the charges against Comey.",
      "In their bid to have the indictment dismissed, Comey's lawyers said that any false-statements charge that rests on an interpretation of a \"fundamentally ambiguous question\" must be dismissed.",
      "\"Fundamental to any false statement charge are both clear questions and false answers,\" they wrote. \"Neither exists here.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers argued that a \"reasonable person\" would've interpreted Cruz to be asking only about whether the former FBI chief had authorized McCabe to be an anonymous source, rather than broadly inquiring about Comey's interactions with anyone at the FBI.",
      "\"The indictment contains no allegations that Mr. Comey's answers were false: it never alleges that Mr. Comey made a false statement regarding Mr. McCabe,\" they wrote. \"On the contrary, the indictment omits Senator Cruz's statements about Mr. McCabe, obscuring the context necessary to understand both the questions themselves and Mr. Comey's responses.\"",
      "Comey's legal team reiterated that he maintains that his 2017 testimony was truthful, but was also argued that his \"statement that he stood by his prior testimony was truthful regardless of whether that prior testimony was itself truthful.\"",

The 2025 shutdown is a few days shy of the record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 34 days and took place during President Trump's first administration.",
      "On Sept. 19, the House passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21, but the bill failed to make it out of the GOP-led Senate the same day. Since government funding lapsed on Oct. 1, the Senate has held a number of votes, but Republicans have not been able to garner the support they need from Democrats to advance the bill.",

      "Since just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the Senate has voted 13 times on a House-passed resolution to fund the government until Nov. 21. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",

      "43: Senate Democrats/independents opposed, plus 1 Republican",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He opposes the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The effort fell short at the time, with two senators who had previously voiced opposition to the tariffs measure absent from the vote.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",
      "The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority.",
      "Afrikaners are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European settlers and colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s. The Trump administration welcomed the first group of Afrikaners granted refugee status in May.",
      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",
      "\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.",
      "Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group.",
      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.",
      "After refugee admissions plummeted to a record low of 11,000 in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 mostly due to Trump-era cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the Biden administration dramatically expanded the program.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, the highest level since the 1990s, according to government data. Officials stopped publishing refugee admissions data after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an \"amazing meeting\" and a \"great success.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a deal\" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement \"pretty soon,\" though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. \"A lot of things we brought to finalization\" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a \"tremendous leader of a very powerful country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47%\u00a0would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.",
      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

    "summary": "Border Patrol agents have been responsible for more Chicago-area arrests than ICE amid \"Midway Blitz,\" an unprecedented shift that has caused some internal tensions, CBS News has learned.",
    "story": [
      "Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.",
      "This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area \"Midway Blitz\" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.",
      "A federal law enforcement official said ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago area comes out to be around 1,800 if arrests by the agency made prior to Sept. 16 \u2014 before CBP started conducting operations in the region \u2014 are counted.",
      "The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.",
      "As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.",
      "That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Over the summer, sweeping \"roving patrols\" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.",
      "Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.",
      "On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.",
      "Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, \"the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.\"",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.",
      "But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.",
      "DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department \"is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.\"",
      "\"DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,\" the department added.",
      "The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.",
      "Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is \"unique,\" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.",
      "Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents \u2014 significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.",
      "But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a \"faster-paced\" and more \"forward-leaning\" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is \"methodical\" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.",
      "\"It's just like a baseball game, right?\" Hudak said. \"If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sweeping sanctions on members of an alleged Mexico-based human smuggling network that it says trafficked people from four continents using yachts, hotels and cartel connections, a move officials say underscores the Trump administration's intensifying strategy to treat migrant trafficking schemes as a direct threat to national security.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) targeted the Bhardwaj Human Smuggling Organization, its alleged ringleader Vikrant Bhardwaj plus three accomplices and 16 affiliated entities on Thursday. The sanctions will freeze any U.S. property or interests tied to the sprawling group and bar U.S. persons from conducting financial transactions with the alleged criminal organization.",
      "According to Treasury officials, the Bhardwaj HSO constructed a \"sophisticated\" smuggling pipeline that tapped its own collection of yachts and marinas, as well as hostels, hotels and other front operations across Mexico, India and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Thousands of migrants from Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia \u2014 including some from countries deemed national security risks \u2014 were allegedly flown or sailed into Mexico, then routed north toward the U.S. border over land, a dangerous passage dubbed the \"Tapachula-Cancun-Mexicali corridor.\"",
      "Officials allege the group's services cost migrants thousands of dollars apiece, and the group solicited operational support from individuals employed by the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.",
      "Investigators identified a web of corporate fronts allegedly controlled or used by the group, spanning so-called tourism companies in Mexico to real estate and hospitality firms in India and the UAE, as well as a Mexican supermarket to hide illicit revenue streams.",
      "The Treasury sanctioned three other associates: Jose German Valadez Flores and Jorge Alejandro Mendoza Villegas are accused of facilitating the trafficking ring by bribing officials at airports and ports of entry, while a third, Indu Rani, is identified as Bhardwaj's wife and the lead on logistical operations.",
      "\"Today's action, in collaboration with our law enforcement partners, disrupts this network's ability to smuggle dangerous illegal aliens into the United States,\" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said in a statement to CBS News. \"The Trump administration will continue to target and dismantle human smuggling organizations that value profit over human life.\"",
      "In recent years, U.S. authorities have expanded the use of sanctions tools \u2014 originally conceived for targeting terrorism or narcotics networks \u2014 to confront human smuggling and transnational criminal organizations.",
      "In June 2023, Biden-era Treasury officials targeted the Hernandez Salas smuggling network for facilitating thousands of migrants and laundering proceeds. Later that year, OFAC sanctioned the Mexican-based Malas Ma\u00f1as trafficking network, linking human smuggling operations to narcotics trafficking and cartel business.",
      "The Treasury's latest move likens the Bhardwaj HSO to full-blown national security threats, akin to drug cartels or terrorist syndicates.",
      "To bolster enforcement, the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) recently issued an alert urging U.S. banks to look out for bulk cash smuggling and repatriation patterns tied to Mexican-based criminal organizations.",
      "Still, Mexican officials have publicly challenged U.S. evidence prompting sanctions under the Trump administration, even questioning past designations connected to Mexican banks for alleged ties to cartel money laundering.",
      "In June 2025, the U.S. Treasury targeted commercial banks CiBanco and Intercam, and the brokerage firm Vector Casa de Bolsa, accusing them of moving money on behalf of cartels and their fentanyl supply chain. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, expressed frustration at the time and publicly requested that the U.S. Treasury \"send proof, if they have it, so we can accompany them in the process.\"",
      "This time around, Treasury officials tell CBS News the latest sanctioning effort against the Bhardwaj HSO was coordinated with Mexico's financial intelligence unit \u2013 the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (UIF) \u2013 as well as agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:38:19 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a statewide network of clinics that provide family-planning services to more than 33,000 patients each year.",
      "Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said the state could lose $6.1 million in Title X funding if federal appropriations expire after March 31, 2026. It's a cut that would reduce access to care across the network. \"That's $6.1 million for Arizona,\" she said. \"That means over 33,000 patients in our state could lose access to services.\"",
      "Thomas noted that two consecutive funding reductions, combined with 11 years of flat federal support and rising healthcare costs, have already strained operations. Without new funding, she warned, clinics may be forced to limit contraceptive options to cheaper methods, reduce preventive care, and risk staff layoffs, especially in rural communities.",
      "\"We're talking about impacts to people's jobs and their ability to access the care they need,\" she said.",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said Wednesday he's allowing South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine in Philadelphia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday that South Korea can build a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "\"Our Military Alliance is stronger than ever before and, based on that, I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines that they have now,\" the president wrote on Truth Social during a multiday visit to South Korea.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the submarine will be built in Philadelphia, as the president and lawmakers seek foreign investments as a way to boost the American shipbuilding industry. A South Korean company bought the Philly Shipyard last year.",
      "During a meeting with Mr. Trump earlier Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he's looking for U.S. support in getting nuclear fuel for submarines. He argued that shifting away from diesel-electric submarines \u2014 which typically have more limited ranges \u2014 would allow South Korea to help the U.S. Navy patrol the region.",
      "\"We're not aiming for nuclear-armed submarines, but rather, conventionally armed submarines powered by nuclear energy,\" Lee said through a translator, saying his country's existing fleet has \"limited capabilities\" and \"cannot really effectively monitor and counter any undersea activities from other countries.\"",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines are a key part of the U.S.'s naval fleet, and the advanced technology necessary to build them is closely guarded by U.S. officials. The Biden administration inked a deal with Australia to help the country build the submarines.",
      "The move could pose concerns for the U.S. and South Korea's two mutual rivals in the region, North Korea and China. The Chinese navy has nuclear-powered submarines, and North Korea said earlier this year it had developed one. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday local time, for talks that are expected to focus on trade.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the submarine deal as part of a broader trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner and a key military ally in the region.",
      "He said the country has agreed to \"pay the USA\" $350 billion, invest in U.S. industry, and buy American oil and gas in exchange for lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. Mr. Trump outlined a similar deal over the summer, which called for 15% tariffs on South Korean goods.",

    "summary": "Some firms involved in the White House ballroom project appear to be trying to lower their online profiles.",
    "story": [
      "\"The site is under construction\" is a sign that could greet visitors peering through the fence at the southeast corner of the White House, trying to catch a glimpse of where the East Wing once stood.",
      "Instead, those are the words greeting visitors to the websites of several companies working on building the White House ballroom.",
      "Some of these firms appear to be trying to lower their profiles (in some cases, literally, on social media) amid the sometimes vitriolic online reaction to the East Wing demolition and construction of the 90,000-square-foot, privately financed ballroom. None of the firms have been accused of any legal wrongdoing.",
      "EAI Rolloff, a Maryland-based hauling company, has advised visitors to its homepage that the site is \"Undergoing Routine Maintenance.\" There are no links or contact information listed.",
      "It's not clear when the site was taken offline or why, but an archived version from earlier this year gives customers options to learn about the company's services, contact the firm or read about its history.",
      "\"We are honest, ethical, responsive, professional and diligent,\" the company's archived \"core values\" page said.",
      "Late last week, a red and charcoal gray truck bearing the EAI logo and phone number delivered discarded rebar from the White House to a scrap yard just outside Washington. The company did not respond to emails and a phone call seeking comment.",
      "Photographers last week captured heavy equipment leveling the East Wing and corridor connecting it to the White House residence. Emblazoned in black, white and red on an excavator arm was ACECO, a Maryland-based demolition company.",
      "ACECO's website is also unavailable. \"This Site Is Under Construction,\" it says in bold block lettering. As recently as August, according to the Internet Archive, ACECO's site showed off the firm's work at the University of Maryland and heralded its clients, which included Clark Construction, the construction contractor hired to build the White House ballroom.",
      "Social media profiles for the company and its leadership are no longer active. WTOP reported that ratings website Yelp \"temporarily disabled the posting of content to the page for ACECO\" because of hostility directed at the company.",
      "One Yelp poster wrote, \"How do you sleep at night when all of America hates you?\"",
      "Representatives for ACECO \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "When President Trump announced the project this summer, he named McCrery Architects as the lead design firm. As recently as April, McCrery's site was robust, displaying the firm's prior design projects, its approach to architecture and staff biographies, according to an archived version of the page maintained by the Internet Archive.",
      "Now, McCrery's website is limited to a single page with a rotating photo, generic email address and phone number. Renderings of the White House ballroom are included in the photo carousel.",
      "When CBS News called the number listed on the firm's website, the phone rang several times before a recorded message said the voicemail was full. A McCrery spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Not all companies have shunned attention brought on by their association with the ballroom.",
      "Websites for Clark Construction and AECOM, the lead engineering firm, appear to be intact. Both are large companies \u2014 Clark has a national footprint and AECOM is a multinational company valued at $17 billion and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "The smaller businesses that have pulled down their websites are headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "Carrier, another multibillion-dollar, publicly traded company, was not shy about its involvement in the ballroom. A company spokesperson proclaimed that Carrier was \"honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

      "Melissa made landfall over eastern Cuba early Wednesday, near the city of Chivirico, as an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 3 storm, the hurricane center said. On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday night, Melissa's core was about 105 miles east-northeast of the central Bahamas and about 800 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 21 mph.",
      "It was expected to continue moving over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday night and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",

      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.",

      "Cuba rides out the storm",
      "People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.",

      "Moving toward the Bahamas",
      "Melissa began affecting the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, said. Authorities in the Bahamas were evacuating dozens of people from the archipelago's southeast corner ahead of Melissa's arrival.",

    "summary": "A Florida couple traveled to Colombia to make their dream of a family a reality through the booming \"fertility tourism\" business.",
    "story": [
      "After two years of trying to get pregnant, Maggie Quinn and Ricardo Escobar faced a financial obstacle they hadn't expected: the cost of in vitro fertilization in the United States.",
      "\"It was astronomical, and you don't know how many rounds you're going to need,\" Quinn said.",
      "With limited insurance coverage, the Florida couple started researching what's known as \"fertility tourism,\" where patients travel abroad for more affordable fertility care.",
      "Ricardo, who is originally from Colombia, found a clinic in the country's capital of Bogota offering a dramatic price difference\u2014a package of four IVF rounds in Colombia for $11,000 compared to around $60,000 for four rounds in the U.S. Medication costs were also less than half of those in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",
      "\"From the U.S., they mainly come for two things,\" Giraldo said. \"The first is cost, and the second is personalized treatment. It's really common that patients there feel they don't have a close relationship with their doctor.\"",
      "The couple made several trips to Colombia, where their first IVF round produced four viable embryos. After multiple embryo transfers, Quinn became pregnant and gave birth to their son, Lorenzo, in 2023. They returned the following year for another round and are now expecting again.",
      "Quinn estimates they saved between $15,000 and $20,000 per round. Her flexible work schedule made the travel possible, and some bloodwork and ultrasounds were completed in Florida.",
      "Dr. Sangita Jindal, with the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, advises Americans pursuing fertility treatment abroad to carefully review local laws.",
      "\"I would want to know that there is a flexible legal framework that would allow me to bring my embryos back to the U.S. for transfer to my uterus,\" Jindal said. \"Some countries may have prohibitive laws around that.\"",
      "The global fertility-tourism market has grown by more than $50 million in the past year and is projected to reach $800 million by 2030.",
      "For Quinn and Escobar, who became pregnant again after two rounds of IVF, the journey has been more emotional.",
      "\"It's a blessing, really,\" Escobar said. \"Being able to have the first one, and then being able to give our first boy a brother is, is just a blessing.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

Apple rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and, eventually, $3 trillion.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

    "story": [
      "Daylight saving time is coming to an end for 2025. This Sunday, Nov. 2, clocks \"fall back\" and we gain an hour. Here's what to know about the seasonal time change.",
      "When does the time change for the end of daylight saving 2025?",
      "Daylight saving time comes to an end on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 2 a.m., when the time goes back to 1 a.m.",
      "Daylight saving time\u00a0began last spring\u00a0on March 9. Clocks will \"spring forward\" next year on March 8, 2026, when daylight saving time returns.",
      "Do we lose or gain an hour when daylight saving time ends?",
      "People will gain an hour as clocks fall back on Sunday. For most Americans, that means an extra hour of sleep.",
      "Many digital clocks will automatically reset overnight, but remember to change any watches or clocks that need to be manually adjusted.",
      "After the time change, darkness will arrive earlier in the evening, and sunrise in the morning will also come earlier.",
      "Why was daylight saving created in the first place?",
      "Annual clock changes have been around for decades, but the origins of the practice remain something of a mystery. People have pointed toward farmers wanting more daylight or cited various proponents of getting up earlier in the day, but some of those theories are disputed.",
      "Germany began observing daylight saving time in 1916 during World War I, with the thought that it would save energy. Other European countries and the U.S. followed suit in the next few years.",
      "There was some debate around the practice in the decades that followed, but eventually, daylight saving time was enacted in the U.S. as a legal requirement by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.",
      "Which states don't do daylight saving time?",
      "While clocks will change for most of the U.S., there are two states and several territories that do not observe daylight saving time. Clocks will not change in\u00a0Hawaii or Arizona (except for in Navajo Nation), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the nation's time zones",
      "States can opt out of observing daylight saving time, but they cannot choose to permanently be on daylight saving time.",
      "Most countries around the world do not observe daylight saving, with the U.S. and most of Europe being the exception rather than the rule, according to Pew Research Center. Among countries that do change their clocks, most of them rolled back an hour in October, according to timeanddate.com.",
      "The debate over daylight saving time today",
      "A 2022 CBS News/YouGov poll found that nearly 80% of Americans supported changing the current system, with more Americans preferring daylight saving time to standard time.",
      "That same year, the Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act that would have made daylight saving time permanent, but it never advanced in the House of Representatives.",
      "President Trump, before his return to office for his second term, said he'd push to eliminate the time change.",
      "\"The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,\" he wrote on Truth Social in December of last year.",
      "While his December comment called for the elimination of daylight saving time, Mr. Trump has, in the past, called for permanent daylight saving \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead.",
      "There have been a number of studies finding that changing clocks twice a year can be disruptive for people's health. In addition to impacting mood and mental health,\u00a0researchers at Stanford Medicine this year said that falling back and springing forward may lead to an increase in heart attacks, obesity and strokes.",

      "The Nov. 4 elections for governor of Virginia \u2014 pitting former Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears \u2014 will serve as one of Democrats' first major opportunities to rebound from the setbacks they suffered in the 2024 presidential election, when they also lost control of the Senate and failed to retake control of the House.",

Glenn Youngkin and become the first GOP candidate since 1997 to succeed a fellow Republican as governor of the commonwealth.",
      "Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency. Regardless of who wins between the two in November, Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become the Commonwealth's first ever female governor.",
      "The Trump administration's impact on the federal workforce and the ongoing shutdown may also be on voters' minds in the coming days, as they get their say in a contest that historically has been fraught with prospect of serving as a rebuke to the incumbent in the White House.",
      "\"It is because of the trade wars and the retaliatory tariff policies and the attack on Virginia, our economy and our people, that we recognize the possibility of November 4, that we recognize how important it is to have a governor who will stand up for Virginians,\" Spanberger said at a recent event.",
      "State of the race",
      "Spanberger headed into the start of early voting in September with a clear advantage in the contest. That momentum threatened to be impacted, however, by a controversy that has made its way through Virginia politics. She has faced difficult political questions in attempting to respond to violent text messages, authored by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race, about a Republican leader.",
      "\"I'm asking my opponent to please, ask him to get out of the race,\" Earle-Sears said during the lone debate between the two candidates. \"Have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as governor. Well as governor, you have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race.\"",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, which were made public after the start of early voting, where he wrote in the past about a fantasy hypothetical situation involving the shooting of a Virginia state House Republican leader.",
      "Jones however has not left the race, and is still running as the Democratic attorney general candidate in the Nov. 4 election.",
      "That dynamic has provided Virginia Republicans with an issue against Democrats that could alienate moderates and independents at a time where concerns about political violence are rampant. Virginia Democrats are also mounting a last-minute effort to redraw congressional districts in the state to help the left counter Mr. Trump's successful push in a series of red states to undertake an overhaul of district maps in hopes of helping Republicans hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections.",

      "Hurricane Melissa brought hurricane-force gusts to Bermuda overnight as it sped toward the British territory, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said, then raced past it. The storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to the Bahamas Thursday after hitting eastern Cuba and Jamaica earlier in the week.",
      "A hurricane warning for Bermuda was discontinued.",
      "Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm. The 13th named storm of the Atlantic season didn't have any direct impact on the United States mainland.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls over Jamaica and Cuba to 100 mph, and its winds had weakened further to 90 mph when the hurricane center issued its 2 a.m. EDT advisory Friday. That made Melissa a Category 1, the lowest on the\u00a0Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa still had 90 mph winds three hour later.",
      "By that time, the NHC said, Melissa's core was about 255 miles north of Bermuda and it was hurrying northeast at 41 mph through the Atlantic's cooler waters.",
      "\"On the forecast track,\" the hurricane center said, \"the center of Melissa is expected to pass to the south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland (Canada) as a post-tropical cyclone tonight. Melissa is expected to become a strong post-tropical cyclone later today with gradual weakening forecast over the weekend.\"",
      "Hurricane-force winds were extending outward up to 80 miles from Melissa's center and tropical-storm-force winds were extending outward up to 265 miles, according to the NHC, which also said \"gusty winds over Bermuda will gradually subside this morning.\"",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "The hurricane center didn't have any significant rainfall in its latest forecast for Bermuda.",
      "But the center did say swells generated by Melissa \"will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola (the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti) , Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda during the next couple of days.",
      "\"These swells are expected to reach the coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada today and persist into the weekend\" and \"are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Climate change has been fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification.

    "summary": "President Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.",
      "\"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR \u2014 INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social.",
      "The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.",
      "Mr. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Senate Majority Leader John Thune for comment. The Senate adjourned on Thursday and is not schedule to meet again until Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.",
      "His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Mr. Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.",
      "From coast to coast, fallout from a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.",
      "Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"People are stressing,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.",
      "\"We are well past time to have this behind us.\"",
      "While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity \u2014 one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat \u2014 could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.",

    "summary": "With food-stamp funding set to lapse Saturday, recipients are asking what happens to their benefits \u2014 and when help might resume.",
    "story": [
      "The prolonged U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0is putting millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits, a vital lifeline for low-income households.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said in a memo Sunday that no benefits will be issued on Nov. 1, leaving the program's roughly 42 million beneficiaries uncertain about how they'll pay for groceries next month.",
      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",
      "Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.",

No documents formalizing the agreements have been released yet, however.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would trim fentanyl-related tariffs on China. These moves should ease tensions between the two superpowers for now, though the president did not mention any long-term deals had been reached.",
      "Xi has not personally made public statements since the meeting.",
      "Tariff rates on imports from China",
      "Mr. Trump said he agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, which he said would bring the rate from 57% to 47%. The president told reporters he expects to sign an agreement on trade \"pretty soon,\" although he also said he's likely to renegotiate it in future years.",
      "The president said he's easing tariffs because China pledged to work with him on the deadly fentanyl crisis. China is the world's largest exporter of the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which has been a longstanding complaint of the president. Levying 47% tariffs on Chinese imports would still mean China has one of the highest tariff rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also said the additional 100% tariffs on imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented.",
      "Xi and China have not said what they will do to curb fentanyl production.",
      "Rare-earth minerals",

      "\"We have a deal now,\" the president said aboard Air Force One on the way back from South Korea. \"Every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year.

      "No paper deal on TikTok",
      "Mr. Trump did not make any announcements about a finalized agreement to keep TikTok running in the U.S., although Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said they received Chinese approval of a deal to transfer ownership of the company, so it's no longer under the umbrella of a Chinese company. Still, Bessent said the matter would be resolved in the coming weeks or months.",
      "\"In Kuala Lumpur, we finalized the TikTok agreement in terms of getting Chinese approval,\" Bessent said on Fox Business. \"And I would expect that that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that.\"",
      "On Sunday, Bessent told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the administration was close to a deal to separate TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and that Mr. Trump and Xi would sign something Thursday. No announcement on this came after the meeting, though.",
      "CBS News has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on Bessent's remarks about securing Chinese approval.",
      "\"China will work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\" China's Commerce Ministry said after the meeting, the Associated Press reported.",

      "The president said whether China purchases chips from Nvidia is largely up to Nvidia and Beijing, after the U.S. imposed restrictions on China's purchase of U.S.-made chips, citing national security reasons. Chips could be used to promote China's military and artificial intelligence capabilities.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries' tests, possibly ending a decades-long U.S. pause that stretches back to the end of the Cold War.",
      "The announcement came moments before Mr. Trump walked into a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.",
      "\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" the president wrote on Truth Social, using his administration's preferred term for the Defense Department. \"That process will begin immediately.\"",
      "It's not clear when or if the military will carry out a test, or what the president meant by restarting tests \"on an equal basis.\"",
      "The U.S. conducted its last nuclear weapons test in Nevada in 1992. President George H.W. Bush then imposed a moratorium on testing in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "China has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996, and Russia \u2014 or the then-Soviet Union \u2014 hasn't carried out such a test since 1990, though Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country had tested a new nuclear-powered drone, which came shortly after a test of a new nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile.",
      "But China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years, a trend that the Pentagon expects to continue for the rest of the decade.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Xi is expected to primarily focus on trade and tariffs, but security concerns still lurk in the U.S.-China relationship.",
      "The U.S. military is discussing a missile launch this week in a \"show of force\" against recent Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, CBS News reported earlier Wednesday. And some Trump allies have encouraged the U.S. president to recognize Taiwanese independence, a move that Beijing has long viewed as unacceptable.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Taranto, a pardoned Jan. 6 defendant who was later convicted of 2023 charges stemming from livestreaming a bomb threat as he drove around former President Barack Obama's D.C. neighborhood, was sentenced Thursday to time served and three years of supervised release.",
      "A day earlier, the Justice Department withdrew its initial sentencing memo in the case, which mentioned Taranto's alleged involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The Justice Department subsequently placed two D.C.-based federal prosecutors on leave after they had filed court papers calling the Jan. 6 Capitol siege a \"riot\" perpetrated by a \"mob,\" three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols praised the two prosecutors who were removed from the case, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, for doing \"an excellent and commendable job\" on the case and said it was some of \"the best\" work he's seen with the \"highest standards of professionalism.\"",
      "The original filing \u2014 which asked a judge to sentence Taranto to 27 months in prison \u2014 mentioned his Jan. 6 charges and briefly described the day's events, writing that \"thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol.\"",
      "That description of the Capitol riot was notable, since President Trump has called Jan. 6 a \"day of love\" and referred to the rioters as \"hostages.\"",
      "The filing also said Taranto had driven to Obama's neighborhood shortly after Mr. Trump posted the former president's purported address on Truth Social and Taranto shared the post. He was also found guilty of illegally carrying two firearms without a license, and unlawfully possessing ammunition at the time of his arrest.",
      "Later, a shorter sentencing memo appeared in the federal court database, omitting the references to the Jan. 6 riot and Mr. Trump's post about Obama. Two different federal prosecutors were listed at the bottom of the filing, along with D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro.",
      "Both Valdavia and White were in the courtroom on Thursday, but declined to speak to reporters after the hearing.",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months, which amounts to time served because he spent more than that length of time in pretrial detention. Nichols also ordered three years of supervised release and said Taranto must undergo drug testing and a mental health evaluation.",
      "Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 accused and convicted Capitol rioters shortly after returning to the Oval Office earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is urging a federal court to dismiss the two federal charges brought against him over allegedly false testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020. He's arguing that the questions he answered, which were asked by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, were \"confusing\" and \"fundamentally ambiguous.\"",
      "In a new filing with the court in Alexandria, Virginia, Comey's lawyers argued that his testimony in response to Cruz's questions was \"literally true\" and cannot support a conviction. The former FBI director's legal team suggested that the government is attempting to try Comey on \"cherry-picked statements\" given during a four-hour long Senate hearing without specifying which parts of his testimony it believes were false or misleading.",
      "They argued that while the government has the authority to prosecute witnesses who mislead federal investigators by giving false answers to clear questions, \"it does not authorize the government to create confusion by posing an imprecise question and then seek to exploit that confusion by placing an after-the-fact nefarious interpretation on the ensuing benign answer.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers also asserted that \"basic due process principles in criminal law require that the questioner frame his questions with clarity so that a witness does not have to guess.\"",
      "A federal grand jury in Alexandria indicted Comey late last month on charges he lied to Congress and obstructed a congressional investigation. The alleged offenses stem from testimony Comey gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020. He has pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "Comey has already filed\u00a0one tranche of motions with the court that argue the indictment should be tossed out on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and selective prosecution. He is also challenging the validity of interim U.S. Attorney\u00a0Lindsey Halligan's appointment to that role.",
      "Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in one of those filings that he would seek to dismiss at least the first count of the indictment \u2014 the allegation that Comey lied to Congress \u2014 because of Cruz's questioning.",
      "In addition to his latest bid to have the charges dismissed, Comey's lawyers are asking for more details about the conduct underlying the two counts. They are claiming the indictment is \"sparse\" and has a \"total absence of factual allegations.\"",
      "The indictment against Comey references an exchange the former FBI director had with an unnamed senator, believed to be Cruz, during the Judiciary Committee hearing more than five years ago. During the questioning, Cruz asked Comey about testimony he gave in May 2017, in which the former FBI chief was questioned about whether he had ever been an anonymous source or authorized anyone to be an anonymous source about matters relating to investigations into President Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016.",
      "Cruz then referenced comments from Andrew McCabe, who was Comey's deputy at the FBI, and claimed McCabe publicly said that Comey authorized him to leak information to the press.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true; one or the other is false. Who's telling the truth?\" Cruz asked Comey.",
      "Comey said in response, \"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by what, the testimony you summarized that I gave in May of 2017.\"",
      "Cruz reiterated that Comey was testifying that he \"never authorized to leak. And Mr. McCabe when if he says contrary is not telling the truth, is that correct?\"",
      "\"Again, I'm not going to characterize Andy's testimony, but mine is the same today,\" Comey replied.",
      "But prosecutors have claimed that Comey's testimony was false because he authorized Daniel Richman, a longtime friend of his, to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the FBI investigation involving Clinton.",
      "The government confirmed to Comey's lawyers that an unidentified individual referred to as \"Person 3\" in the indictment is Richman. A Columbia University law professor, Richman is a former federal prosecutor who also served as a \"special government employee\" at the FBI when Comey was director.",
      "Richman has not been charged with any wrongdoing. His name also did not come up in the exchange that appears to have led to the charges against Comey.",
      "In their bid to have the indictment dismissed, Comey's lawyers said that any false-statements charge that rests on an interpretation of a \"fundamentally ambiguous question\" must be dismissed.",
      "\"Fundamental to any false statement charge are both clear questions and false answers,\" they wrote. \"Neither exists here.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers argued that a \"reasonable person\" would've interpreted Cruz to be asking only about whether the former FBI chief had authorized McCabe to be an anonymous source, rather than broadly inquiring about Comey's interactions with anyone at the FBI.",
      "\"The indictment contains no allegations that Mr. Comey's answers were false: it never alleges that Mr. Comey made a false statement regarding Mr. McCabe,\" they wrote. \"On the contrary, the indictment omits Senator Cruz's statements about Mr. McCabe, obscuring the context necessary to understand both the questions themselves and Mr. Comey's responses.\"",
      "Comey's legal team reiterated that he maintains that his 2017 testimony was truthful, but was also argued that his \"statement that he stood by his prior testimony was truthful regardless of whether that prior testimony was itself truthful.\"",

There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. When all senators are present, there have been 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate, which has 100 senators, requires only a simple majority to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators vote to end debate.",

On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",

      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on countries around the world, the third in a trio of rebukes of the president's trade policy this week.",
      "In a 51 to 47 vote, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve the resolution. Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, supported the resolution. It was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation, requiring just a simple majority.",
      "The resolution is largely symbolic since it almost certainly won't be taken up by the House, where GOP leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs. Senate Democrats forced a vote on the resolution, which was led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, by bypassing GOP leadership using a provision of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law that the president invoked to impose the tariffs.",
      "In April, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency, citing \"structural imbalances in the global trading system.\" The president then announced the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, dubbing it \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Wyden, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said the president's \"actions clearly go beyond what the law allows, which is why I'm urging passage of this bill to finally end the president's unlawful tariffs.\"",
      "\"The Senate is not a spectator to the workings of the federal government,\" Wyden said. \"When it comes to international trade, and tariffs in particular, the United States Congress has clear authority.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, spoke out against the resolution, saying \"at this juncture, this resolution is counterproductive to helping American families and businesses of all sizes.\"",
      "\"It's no secret that for decades, countries around the globe have raised tariff and non-tariff barriers against Americans and against American business, and have raised the cost for Americans and American businesses without response from the United States. President Trump is now responding,\" Crapo said. \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit.\"",
      "The vote came after Mr. Trump announced overnight that he would cut tariffs on Beijing after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. China was part of the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and has been embroiled in a months-long trade war with the U.S.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans earlier this week on the issue, defended the tariffs, telling reporters that \"tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first.\"",
      "\"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country,\" the vice president said. \"They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The Senate on Tuesday approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure. Then, on Wednesday, the Senate approved a resolution that would block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, with support from four Republicans.",
      "Thursday's vote also marked the second time the chamber has weighed in on the issue, after the Senate voted in April on a resolution to Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The effort fell short at the time, with two senators who had previously voiced opposition to the tariffs measure absent from the vote.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:52:49 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Treasury Department no longer minting the one-cent coin, some businesses are offering perks to customers who bring in pennies.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses around the U.S. are desperate for pennies.",
      "President Trump's decision to stop producing the penny earlier this year is leaving some merchants short of the one-cent coin and struggling to give customers exact change. Unable to order fresh supplies of pennies, banks are also rationing them.",
      "Some retailers are pulling out all the stops just to scrounge up some pennies. Pennsylvania-based grocery chain Giant Eagle is holding a one-day event this weekend where customers can exchange their pennies for gift cards worth double the value of the coins, CBS News Pittsburgh reports.",
      "Sheetz, a convenience store chain, is also running a promotion offering a free soda to customers who bring in 100 pennies.",
      "Troy Richards, president and chief operations officer at Louisiana-based Guaranty Bank & Trust Co., said he's had to scramble to have enough pennies on hand for his customers since August.",
      "\"We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,\" Richards said.",
      "Richards said the $1,800 in pennies the bank had were gone in two weeks. His branches are keeping small amounts of pennies for customers who need to cash checks, but that's it.",
      "The lack of pennies has also become a legal minefield for stores and retailers. In some states and cities, it is illegal to round up a transaction to the nearest nickel or dime because doing so would run afoul of laws that are supposed to place cash customers, as well as debit and credit card customers, on an equal playing field when it comes to item costs.",
      "To avoid lawsuits, retailers are rounding down. While two or three cents may not seem like much, that extra change can add up over tens of thousands of transactions. A spokesman for Kwik Trip, the Midwest convenience store chain, said it has been rounding down every cash transaction to the nearest nickel.",
      "That's expected to cost the company roughly $3 million this year. Some retailers are asking customers to give their change to local or affiliated charities at the cash register, in an effort to avoid pennies as well.",
      "Costs more than they're worth",
      "To be sure, retailers and banks aren't clamoring for pennies to stick around. Pennies, especially in bulk, are heavy and largely used to give customers change.",
      "\"We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The penny, which dates from the\u00a0early days of the U.S. Mint\u00a0after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. One penny cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "\"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Feb. 9 post on his Truth Social social media platform.",
      "The Treasury Department said in May that it was placing its last order of copper-zinc planchets \u2014 the blank metal disks that are minted into coins. In June, the last pennies were minted, and by August those pennies were distributed to banks and armored vehicle service companies.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Piling up in jars",
      "The U.S. Mint issued 3.2 billion pennies in 2024, the last full year of production, more than double that of the second-most minted coin in the country: the quarter. But the problem with pennies is they are issued, given as change and rarely recirculated back into the economy. Americans store their pennies in jars or use them for decoration. This requires the Mint to produce significant sums of pennies each year.",
      "The government is expected to save $56 million by not minting pennies, according to the Treasury Department. Despite losing money on the penny, the Mint is profitable for the U.S. government through its production of other circulating coins as well as coin proof and commemorative sets that appeal to numismatic collectors.",
      "In 2024, the Mint made $182 million in seigniorage, which is its equivalent of profit.",
      "Besides Americans' penny-hoarding habit, a logistical issue is also preventing pennies from circulating.",
      "The distribution of coins is handled by the Federal Reserve system. Several companies, mostly armored carrier companies, operate coin terminals where banks can withdraw and deposit coins. Roughly a third of these 170 coin terminals are now closed to both penny deposits as well as penny withdrawals.",
      "Bank lobbyists say these terminals being closed to penny deposits is exacerbating the penny shortage, because parts of the country that may have some surplus pennies are unable to get those pennies to parts of country with shortages.",
      "\"As a result of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted\" a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.",
      "The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had any guidance for retailers or banks regarding the penny shortage, or the issues regarding penny circulation.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back\"",
      "The U.S. isn't the first country to transition away from small denomination coins or discontinue out-of-date coins. But in all of these cases, governments wound down the use of their out-of-date coins over a period of, often, years.",
      "For example, Canada announced it would eliminate its one-cent coin in 2012, transitioning away from one-cent cash transactions starting in 2013 and is still redeeming and recycling one-cent coins a decade later. The \"decimalization\" process of converting British coins from farthings and shillings to a 100-pence-to-a-pound system took much of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "The U.S. removed the penny from commerce abruptly, without any action by Congress or any regulatory guidance for banks, retailers or states. The retail and banking industries, rarely allies in Washington on policy matters related to point-of-sale, are demanding that Washington issue guidance or pass a law fixing the issues that are arising due to the shortage.",
      "\"We don't want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,\" said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.",

      "Abby Zwerner, a former Virginia teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student in her classroom in 2023, testified Thursday that she thought she had died in the shooting.",
      "\"I thought I was dying, I thought I had died,\" Zwerner said. \"I thought I was either on my way to heaven or in heaven, but then it all got black, and so I then thought I wasn't going there, and then I, my next memory is I see two coworkers around me, and I process that I'm hurt, and they're putting pressure on where I'm hurt.\"",
      "Zwerner also said she held up her hand just before the shooting because she could tell she was about to be shot.",
      "\"The moment went by very fast,\" she said.",
      "Zwerner was testifying in her $40 million lawsuit filed against a former assistant principal who is accused of ignoring multiple warnings that the student had a gun.",
      "Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest in January 2023 as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News. Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and no longer has the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.",
      "The shooting sent shock waves through the military shipbuilding community and the country, with many wondering how a child so young could access a gun and shoot his teacher.",
      "Zwerner no longer works for the school district and has said she has no plans to teach again. It was revealed in court Wednesday that she has become a licensed cosmetologist.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",
      "The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority.",
      "Afrikaners are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European settlers and colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s. The Trump administration welcomed the first group of Afrikaners granted refugee status in May.",
      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",
      "\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.",
      "Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group.",
      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.",
      "After refugee admissions plummeted to a record low of 11,000 in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 mostly due to Trump-era cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the Biden administration dramatically expanded the program.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, the highest level since the 1990s, according to government data. Officials stopped publishing refugee admissions data after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "While flying back to Washington on Air Force One after the meeting, Trump told reporters it was a \"great success\" and said he would head to China in April for new talks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an \"amazing meeting\" and a \"great success.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a deal\" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement \"pretty soon,\" though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. \"A lot of things we brought to finalization\" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a \"tremendous leader of a very powerful country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47%\u00a0would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.",
      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

    "summary": "The United Nations human rights chief says the Trump administration \"must halt\" strikes on alleged drug boats to prevent \"extrajudicial killing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014\u00a0The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are \"unacceptable\" and must stop.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.",
      "Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for T\u00fcrk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"",
      "She said T\u00fcrk believed \"airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.\"",
      "President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls \"narco-trafficking vessels\" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.",
      "In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said\u00a0the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.",
      "The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.",
      "After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed \"drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by \"careful limits\" placed on the use of lethal force.",
      "Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing \"an imminent threat to life,\" she said. \"Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "The strikes are taking place \"outside the context\" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa brought hurricane-force gusts to Bermuda overnight as it sped toward the British territory, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said, then raced past it. The storm brought heavy rains and gusty winds to the Bahamas Thursday after hitting eastern Cuba and Jamaica earlier in the week.",
      "A hurricane warning for Bermuda was discontinued.",
      "Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm. The 13th named storm of the Atlantic season didn't have any direct impact on the United States mainland.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm's wind speeds dropped after its landfalls over Jamaica and Cuba to 100 mph, and its winds had weakened further to 90 mph when the hurricane center issued its 2 a.m. EDT advisory Friday. That made Melissa a Category 1, the lowest on the\u00a0Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Melissa still had 90 mph winds three hour later.",
      "By that time, the NHC said, Melissa's core was about 255 miles north of Bermuda and it was hurrying northeast at 41 mph through the Atlantic's cooler waters.",
      "\"On the forecast track,\" the hurricane center said, \"the center of Melissa is expected to pass to the south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland (Canada) as a post-tropical cyclone tonight. Melissa is expected to become a strong post-tropical cyclone later today with gradual weakening forecast over the weekend.\"",
      "Hurricane-force winds were extending outward up to 80 miles from Melissa's center and tropical-storm-force winds were extending outward up to 265 miles, according to the NHC, which also said \"gusty winds over Bermuda will gradually subside this morning.\"",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "The hurricane center didn't have any significant rainfall in its latest forecast for Bermuda.",
      "But the center did say swells generated by Melissa \"will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola (the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti) , Cuba, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda during the next couple of days.",
      "\"These swells are expected to reach the coast of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada today and persist into the weekend\" and \"are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Climate change has been fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has accused Gustavo Petro of enabling drug cartels and placed him on the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list.",
    "story": [
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro had trouble refueling his plane on a trip to the Middle East after being sanctioned by the United States, his government said Thursday.",
      "Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said that the presidential plane stopped in Madrid to refuel on the way to Saudi Arabia but that officials at Barajas airport, Spain's biggest, refused to fill it up.",
      "After negotiations with Spain's left-wing government, the plane landed at a military base to refuel.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has accused Petro of enabling drug cartels and placed him on the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list.",
      "\"Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week when annoucing the sanctions.",
      "Petro, his wife Veronica Alcocer, eldest son Nicolas, and Benedetti are banned from traveling to the United States and any U.S. assets they have are frozen.",
      "U.S. companies or companies with US capital are also banned from doing business with them.",
      "Writing on X, Petro thanked the \"kingdom of Spain\" for helping him reach Riyadh at the start of a three-country tour that will also take him to Qatar and Egypt.",
      "Benedetti said that the aviation refueling company at Barajas was afraid of breaching U.S. sanctions on Petro.",
      "\"The companies that sell fuel or provide cleaning services or the boarding stairs (at airports) are almost always American,\" Benedetti said.",
      "\"They refused to provide the (refueling) service because of the OFAC (list),\" he said, referring to harsh financial sanctions slapped by Mr. Trump on the leftist Petro, one of his most vociferous critics.",
      "The sanctions imposed on Petro on October 24 followed months of friction between Trump and Petro over U.S. migrant deportations and strikes on suspected drug boats off the coast of South America.",
      "In an\u00a0exclusive conversation\u00a0with CBS News earlier this month, Petro claimed some of those killed by the U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law. The White House has denied that innocent civilians were killed in the boat strikes.",
      "Petro, a former left-wing guerrilla, has vehemently denied any involvement in drug trafficking and argued that the cocaine trade is being fueled chiefly by demand in the United States and Europe.",
      "Last month, the U.S. State Department announced it was revoking Petro's visa after he participated in a New York protest where he called on American soldiers to disobey President Donald Trump's orders.",
      "The department\u00a0said on social media\u00a0that Petro \"stood on a NYC street and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence. We will revoke Petro's visa due to his reckless and incendiary actions.\"",

    "story": [
      "The rumble of large machinery, whine of chain saws and chopping of machetes echoed through communities across the northern Caribbean as they dug out from the destruction of Hurricane Melissa and surveyed the damage it left behind.",
      "The storm was being blamed for at least 45 deaths, mostly in Haiti and Jamaica. It also hit Cuba hard.",
      "Authorities said 19 people were killed in Jamaica, at least 25 in Haiti and at least one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Melissa was over the open waters of the Atlantic after racing past Bermuda\u00a0early Friday packing 90 mph maximum sustained winds, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. A hurricane warning for the wealthy British territory was discontinued.",
      "The agency said, \"Melissa is expected to become a strong post-tropical cyclone later (Friday) with gradual weakening forecast over the weekend.\"",
      "In Jamaica, government workers and residents began clearing roads in a push to reach dozens of isolated communities in the island's southeast that sustained a direct hit from one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record.",
      "Stunned residents wandered about, some staring at their roofless homes and waterlogged belongings strewn around them.",
      "\"I don't have a house now,\" said Sylvester Guthrie, a resident of Lacovia in the southern parish of St. Elizabeth, as he held onto his bicycle, the only possession of value left after the storm.",
      "Emergency relief flights were landing at Jamaica's main international airport as crews distributed water, medicine and other basic supplies. Helicopters dropped food as they thrummed above communities where the storm flattened homes, wiped out roads and destroyed bridges, cutting them off from assistance.",
      "\"The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened,\" Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon said.",
      "Officials said the dead in Jamaica included a child, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of a victim tangled in a tree. On Thursday, dozens of U.S. search-and-rescue experts landed in Jamaica along with their dogs.",
      "More than 13,000 people remained crowded into shelters, with 72% of the island without power and only 35% of mobile phone sites operational, officials said. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas.",
      "\"We understand the frustration, we understand your anxiety, but we ask for your patience,\" said Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's telecommunications and energy minister.",
      "Water trucks were mobilized to serve many of Jamaica's rural communities that aren't connected to the government's utility system, Water Minister Matthew Samuda said.",
      "No reported deaths but Cuba far from spared",
      "In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides.",
      "No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday.",
      "The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santer\u00eda, an Afro-Cuban religion.",
      "\"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster,\" said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away.",
      "Even the basilica was hit.",
      "\"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage,\" Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said.",
      "A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel didn't provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces - Santiago, Granma, Holgu\u00edn, Guant\u00e1namo, and Las Tunas - reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations.",
      "Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines.",
      "In an unusual statement Thursday, the U.S. State Department said Washington was \"ready to assist the Cuban people.\" It said the U.S. \"is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need.\"",
      "The statement didn't specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions.",
      "Haiti reeling",
      "Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 20 people were reported missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Some 15,000 people also remained in shelters.",
      "\"It is a sad moment for the country,\" said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 04:18:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Egyptian Museum has taken 30 years to become a reality, but it is finally set to open its doors, with an equally grand opening ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Egypt's government will host dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday as it holds an official opening ceremony for the Grand Egyptian Museum, a $1 billion project decades in the making that was plagued by multiple delays and a ballooning of the budget.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "The initial cost for the more than 5-million-square-foot, triangular-themed structure about a mile from the iconic pyramids of Giza was estimated at $500 million, but the final price tag was more than double that. Costing over $1 billion, the\u00a0project was funded through Egyptian resources and international cooperation.",
      "In front of the main entrance stands the imposing 53-foot-high Hanging Obelisk, the only such structure in the world. The obelisk itself is about 3,500 years old, but it sits suspended overhead on a modern structure with a glass floor, so visitors can peer up and view its ancient inscriptions from an angle never before possible.",
      "Beyond is the Grand Staircase, with 108 steps bringing people up the equivalent of six floors to the main galleries, with colossal statues on view the whole way up.",
      "The GEM has 12 primary exhibition halls, covering about 194,000 square feet.",
      "The number of artifacts on display has nearly doubled initial expectations thanks to Egypt's wealth of antiquities, with officials saying about 100,000 items will be housed in the halls.",
      "To put that in perspective, if a visitor were to spend one minute looking at each artifact on display in the museum, it would take almost 70 sleepless days to view the entire collection.",
      "The museum's triangular architecture radiates outward from its entrance toward the three main pyramids of Giza, aligning perfectly with their positions. Its walls and sloping ceilings follow the same lines, rising toward the pyramids' highest points, but not exceeding the height of the ancient structures, out of respect for their builders.",
      "The museum's interior offers stunning panoramic views of the pyramids. The concept may sound simple, but it required a significant reshaping of the local topography, including the excavation and removal of some 79 million cubic feet of sand, which took workers seven months.",
      "King Ramses II was there first",
      "In the entrance courtyard of the GEM, stands a massive, 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II. The statue was moved in 2006 from a busy square in central Cairo to a site near the Great Pyramids, where it stood awaiting the new landmark museum's construction.",
      "The 83-ton statue's journey took 10 hours, processing slowly through the streets of Egypt under heavy security as people watched on TV.",
      "Later Ramses was moved to a new permanent home, about 400 yards away, and the museum was built around it.",
      "King Tut's complete collection",
      "The GEM's main attraction, it could be argued, is the complete collection of the famous King Tutankhamun, the golden boy.",
      "All 5,398 items from the tomb of the 13th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who ruled from around 1333 to 1323 B.C., will be displayed together in one place for the first time since they were discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "The new showroom is six times the size of the one that previously housed much of the Tut collection, at the old Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.",
      "King Khufu's Boats",
      "The GEM also boasts the King Khufu's Boats Museum, showing the 4,500-year-old the boats that were designed to be used in the journey to the afterlife.",
      "The two royal boats were discovered in 1954 near the Pyramid of Khufu. It took experts more than 10 years to reassemble the first boat. It is now fully reconstructed and was moved to the museum in 2021. Visitors of the museum can also view the conservation work underway on the second one.",
      "Scholars believe they were either used in Khufu's funeral procession or they were intended for his journey with the sun god Re in the afterlife.",
      "The long road to the Grand Egyptian Museum",
      "The idea for a grand museum on this site in Egypt dates back more than 32 years. The government first allocated 117 acres for the project at the location in 1992.",
      "At the very beginning of 2002, Egypt launched a massive international architectural competition to find a winning design for the museum. A total of 2,227 architects from 103 countries applied to submit designs, and by August of that year, 1,550 from 83 countries had submitted conceptual drawings.",
      "A couple months later officials had whittled the options down to only 20 designs to put forward for a second stage. In July 2003, the prize - and the massive contract - was awarded to the Irish architectural firm Heneghan Peng.",
      "The plan was originally for the museum to open in 2010, but a series of events including financial crises, political uprisings, the COVID-19 pandemic and regional wars delayed the curtain raising.",
      "A government spokesperson said the opening ceremony would draw an unprecedented number of world leaders, with as many as 40 heads of state, including royalty, expected to attend, along with a large number of other senior officials from around the world, though no names have been confirmed.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

On Thursday, Melissa was moving away from the Bahamas and had turned toward Bermuda, where weather conditions were expected to \"rapidly deteriorate\" later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "President Trump has directed the State Department \"to mobilize support for affected communities\" in Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, and Turks and Caicos in the aftermath of the hurricane, the department\u00a0said in an announcement\u00a0on Thursday. The announcement said it would also be monitoring the situation in Bermuda.",
      "\"The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support,\" the announcement said.",

      "Emergency relief flights began landing at Jamaica's main international airport, which reopened late Wednesday, as crews distributed water, food and other basic supplies.",
      "\"The devastation is enormous,\" Jamaican Transportation Minister Daryl Vaz said.",
      "At a news conference Thursday morning, Vaz and other officials spoke about some of the lingering consequences of the hurricane for communities in Jamaica.",
      "\"There are people who still have not been able to make contact with their families, their loved ones, their friends, and road access is still impossible,\" Vaz told reporters, referencing isolated areas on the western side of the island that responders have not yet been able to reach. \"So, you can imagine the deep, deep sense of worry that is widespread across Jamaica.\"",
      "Some Jamaicans wondered where they would live.",
      "\"I am now homeless, but I have to be hopeful because I have life,\" said Sheryl Smith, who lost the roof of her home.",
      "Authorities said they have found at least four bodies in southwest Jamaica.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said up to 90% of roofs in the southwest coastal community of Black River were destroyed.",
      "\"Black River is what you would describe as ground zero,\" he said. \"The people are still coming to grips with the destruction.\"",
      "More than 25,000 people remained crowded into shelters across the western half of Jamaica, with 77% of the island without power.",
      "Dana Morris Dixon, a minister of education and information, said at a Thursday news conference that military crews and government officials were still working to access some of the western areas hit hardest by the storm. They were able to visit a handful of places by helicopter on Wednesday, but at times could not physically get to all of the locations they wanted to reach because \"sometimes the helicopter could not land due to the devastation,\" Dixon said.",
      "\"The military is cutting their way on foot through blocked roads,\" the minister continued, adding that crews were in the middle of attempting to cut through an area covered with thick bamboo, a task they could not finish completely on Wednesday and resumed Thursday morning.",
      "Haiti hard hit",
      "Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 23 people were reported killed and 13 others missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Another 17 people suffered injuries, officials said.",

      "Cuba cleanup begins",
      "In Cuba, people began to clear blocked roads and highways with heavy equipment and even enlisted the help of the military, which rescued people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides.",
      "No fatalities were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba. They were slowly starting to return home.",
      "\"We are cleaning the streets, clearing the way,\" said Yaima Almenares, a physical education teacher from the city of Santiago, as she and other neighbors swept branches and debris from sidewalks and avenues, cutting down fallen tree trunks and removing accumulated trash.",
      "In the more rural areas outside the city of Santiago de Cuba, water remained accumulated in vulnerable homes on Wednesday night as residents returned from their shelters to save beds, mattresses, chairs, tables and fans they had elevated ahead of the storm.",
      "A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel did not provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces \u2014 Santiago, Granma, Holgu\u00edn, Guant\u00e1namo and Las Tunas \u2014 reported losses of roofs, power lines, fiber optic telecommunications cables, cut roads, isolated communities and losses of banana, cassava and coffee plantations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heres-what-trump-says-he-and-xi-agreed-to-in-their-meeting/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. and China reached deals on several items, including a short-term agreement on rare-earth minerals, and soybean sales to China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump called his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea Thursday \"amazing,\" and said the two reached agreements on a number of items, including the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China and a short-term deal for access to rare earth minerals. No documents formalizing the agreements have been released yet, however.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would trim fentanyl-related tariffs on China. These moves should ease tensions between the two superpowers for now, though the president did not mention any long-term deals had been reached.",
      "Xi has not personally made public statements since the meeting.",
      "Tariff rates on imports from China",
      "Mr. Trump said he agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, which he said would bring the rate from 57% to 47%. The president told reporters he expects to sign an agreement on trade \"pretty soon,\" although he also said he's likely to renegotiate it in future years.",
      "The president said he's easing tariffs because China pledged to work with him on the deadly fentanyl crisis. China is the world's largest exporter of the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, which has been a longstanding complaint of the president. Levying 47% tariffs on Chinese imports would still mean China has one of the highest tariff rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also said the additional 100% tariffs on imports from China, which he previously said would take effect Nov. 1, will not be implemented.",
      "Xi and China have not said what they will do to curb fentanyl production.",
      "Rare-earth minerals",
      "Mr. Trump said Beijing would delay its recently announced export restrictions on rare-earth minerals for one year, a delay he expects to be routinely extended. Mr. Trump claimed the rare earth issue has been \"settled.\"",
      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie and they're used to make everything from semiconductor chips to missiles.",
      "\"We have a deal now,\" the president said aboard Air Force One on the way back from South Korea. \"Every year we'll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. We'll negotiate at the end of a year. But all of the rare earth has been settled.\"",
      "China to resume buying U.S. soybeans",
      "Mr. Trump also announced on Truth Social that Xi authorized China to begin purchasing \"massive amounts of soybeans\" and other farm products from the U.S.",
      "Soybeans have been a serious point of contention between the U.S. and China, after China, typically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, stopped buying them altogether as a rebuke of Mr. Trump's tariff regime.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Thursday that China has pledged to return to regular levels of soybean purchases each year for the next three years, and that China agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season.",
      "No paper deal on TikTok",
      "Mr. Trump did not make any announcements about a finalized agreement to keep TikTok running in the U.S., although Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said they received Chinese approval of a deal to transfer ownership of the company, so it's no longer under the umbrella of a Chinese company. Still, Bessent said the matter would be resolved in the coming weeks or months.",
      "\"In Kuala Lumpur, we finalized the TikTok agreement in terms of getting Chinese approval,\" Bessent said on Fox Business. \"And I would expect that that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we'll finally see a resolution to that.\"",
      "On Sunday, Bessent told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the administration was close to a deal to separate TikTok from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and that Mr. Trump and Xi would sign something Thursday. No announcement on this came after the meeting, though.",
      "CBS News has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on Bessent's remarks about securing Chinese approval.",
      "\"China will work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\" China's Commerce Ministry said after the meeting, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcing a law Congress passed banning TikTok from operating in the U.S. as long as it's operating under its China-based parent company, and the Supreme Court upheld that ban.",
      "On chips",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Xi \"did discuss chips,\" and Xi would be \"talking with Nvidia and others. Mr. Trump said he'd speak with Nvidia CEO Jensen Hugan, as China seeks to buy U.S.-made chips.",
      "The president said whether China purchases chips from Nvidia is largely up to Nvidia and Beijing, after the U.S. imposed restrictions on China's purchase of U.S.-made chips, citing national security reasons. Chips could be used to promote China's military and artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "\"I said that's going to be between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator and the referee,\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "story": [
      "A newspaper reporter in London thought they were reaching out to former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for an interview about Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The person they actually contacted was Bill DeBlasio, a wine importer from Huntington, Long Island.",
      "Instead of correcting the reporter's mistake, DeBlasio decided to have some fun.",
      "\"I never said I was the mayor\"",
      "It was DeBlasio's email address, bearing his full name, that got his opinion of Mamdani onto the pages of The Times of London.",
      "A reporter reached out via email, and the wine importer light-heartedly obliged, sharing some criticisms of Mamdani.",
      "\"I never said I was the mayor. He sent it to 'Mr. de Blasio' and I replied as 'Bill DeBlasio,'\" DeBlasio said. \"I spelled my name properly, no small D, you know. The big D, you know. The way my grandparents told us we were supposed to spell our name.\"",
      "The paper said they retracted the story \"after discovering that our reporter had been misled by an individual falsely claiming to be the former New York mayor.\"",
      "\"I just can't believe that, you know, I hate to call them lazy, but, like, they didn't check, and he didn't address me as mayor,\" DeBlasio said. \"It was a little bit of sloppy reporting, you know, obviously they didn't vet me out. I never thought it would make it that far.\"",
      "\"It literally was a surreal feeling\"",
      "The man truly surprised by the interview was de Blasio, a major Mamdani supporter.",
      "\"This is what's so weird -- I have people still reaching out to me saying, 'Oh, I see you changed your mind.' I'm like, no, I never did. It literally was a surreal feeling,\" de Blasio said. \"I'm looking at a headline. I'm looking at a quote. A newspaper I never spoke to, a journalist I never contacted.\"",
      "DeBlasio said the mix-up is nothing new.",
      "\"It's been brutal having the same name as the ex-mayor, especially an unpopular one,\" DeBlasio said. \"It's been entertaining. I think I've handled it with humor and had some fun with it over the years.\"",
      "He says he's learned to play along.",
      "\"I've been to, like, charity golf outings, and it was a bunch of firemen and cops, and they were like, 'oh, longest drive, Bill DeBlasio,' and I've been booed. You know, they'd start booing,\" he said.",

      "\"He says to me, he goes, 'So how bad is it having the same name as me?' And I said, 'Dude, you're f------ killing me,'\" DeBlasio said. \"And he paused for, like, a second, like he was taken aback, he didn't know what to say.

    "story": [
      "Prince Andrew is being stripped of his titles and must surrender his lease to Royal Lodge, the mansion in Windsor where he lives, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace.",
      "\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor,\" the statement said. \"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",
      "Andrew had recently said he would stop using his royal titles and honors, including the Duke of York, but Thursday's statement on behalf of King Charles III and Queen Camilla initiated the formal process of revoking all his titles, including prince.",
      "\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement said.",
      "Andrew has come under intense scrutiny over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and accusations from\u00a0Virginia Giuffre\u00a0that she was trafficked to engage in sex with the prince while she was underage. Andrew has denied the allegations. He reached a\u00a0settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,\" the statement said.",
      "Giuffre's family said Thursday in a statement provided to CBS News' partner network BBC News, \"Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.\"",
      "\"Today, she declares victory. We, her family, along with her survivor sisters, continue Virginia's battle and will not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" said the statement sent on behalf of her brother, Sky Roberts, and sister-in-law, Amanda.",
      "In a memoir published posthumously, Giuffre detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, [Ghislaine] Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\" (Maxwell was convicted for her role in trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.)",
      "In 2022, Andrew gave up his military affiliations, royal patronages and official public duties. He also stopped using the title \"His Royal Highness.\"",
      "Andrew had faced heavy criticism from the British public over his living arrangements, with many voicing concern that he continued to live in his mansion on a royal estate despite the accusations leveled against him and his retreat from royal duties.",
      "His 75-year lease for Royal Lodge, signed in 2003, included an up-front payment of around 8 million pounds (around $10.5 million) and an annual rent described as a \"peppercorn,\" meaning an extremely small amount, according to\u00a0BBC News. Part of that payment was for renovations to the property, which at the time was in a state of disrepair, and Buckingham Palace felt that having Andrew pay the cost to upgrade the property was better than using public funds, BBC reported.",
      "The lease had previously been referred to as \"cast iron,\" and Buckingham Palace said it needed to negotiate with Andrew in order to remove him, but did not provide further information about the details of those negotiations.",
      "Buckingham Palace said Andrew will move out of the residence as soon as possible and will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, located about 100 miles north of London.",

      "Speaking at a graduation ceremony for military commanders in southern Israel on Thursday, Netanyahu warned, \"If Hamas continues to blatantly violate the ceasefire, it will experience powerful strikes, as it did the day before yesterday and yesterday.\"",

      "While officials said that damage assessments remained underway to determine the full scope of the destruction, satellite images offered a preliminary look at some of the storm's grave impacts on stretches of the Jamaican coastline.",
      "Side-by-side aerial photographs show the southwestern Jamaican fishing village of White House and the nearby town of Black River before and after Melissa slammed into the island. Each pair captures a once vibrant-looking town reduced to dirt and rubble.",
      "Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday \u2014 its first landfall of multiple \u2014 as an extremely powerful Category 5 hurricane. It was the strongest storm to hit Jamaica in the island's record-keeping history, in addition to one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. That was due to its winds and pressure, which are two primary markers of intensity.",
      "The hurricane's maximum winds had reached a formidable 185 mph when it collided with the southwestern coast of Jamaica, near the town of New Hope. Although their speed dipped somewhat in the hours after landfall, Melissa's winds remained well above the 157-mph threshold that the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale sets to determine the minimum criteria for a Category 5 storm.",
      "At least four people died in Jamaica as a result of the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, a minister of local government, in a statement released Wednesday. McKenzie said police found their bodies washed up by flood waters and determined that all four were \"by all indications, direct victims of the Hurricane.\"",
      "More than 25,000 people were still crowded in shelters on the island on Wednesday, after the storm temporarily displaced some residents and left others homeless.",
      "Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power the morning after the storm, while Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management told the Nationwide News Network radio station that officials were facing challenges as they attempted to perform damage assessments, because of \"a total communication blackout\" in certain areas.",
      "Outside of Jamaica, authorities have confirmed at least 23 deaths in Haiti and at least one death in the Dominican Republic as a result of the hurricane. The storm was moving away from the Bahamas on Thursday morning and headed toward Bermuda, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history at 7,500 spots.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday announced it would set the lowest refugee admissions cap in U.S. history, allocating just 7,500 spots for this fiscal year, mostly for Afrikaners who it has claimed are facing racial discrimination in South Africa for being White.",
      "The previous lowest refugee ceiling was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.",
      "The announcement Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his top aides to dramatically scale back the decades-old U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, a humanitarian policy for vulnerable people fleeing war and violence across the world that once enjoyed robust bipartisan support.",
      "Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program hours after taking office for a second time earlier this year, citing strains on American communities receiving the refugees and concerns about the vetting process. Weeks later, his administration made an exemption for Afrikaners, calling them victims of racial oppression.",
      "In an order posted on the federal government's journal of regulations, Mr. Trump said the 7,500 refugee spots for fiscal year 2026 would \"primarily be allocated among Afrikaners\" and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" Fiscal year 2026 started on Oct. 1 and culminates at the end of September 2026.",
      "The South African government has vehemently denied Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted. Before the 1990s, White South Africans enforced a brutal system of apartheid over the country's Black majority.",
      "Afrikaners are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European settlers and colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s. The Trump administration welcomed the first group of Afrikaners granted refugee status in May.",
      "The prioritization of Afrikaners \u2014 while refugees from places like Afghanistan, Myanmar and Sudan plagued by ethnic violence and armed conflict are being blocked from entering the U.S. \u2014 has led to accusations of preferential treatment among refugee advocates.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, one of several national groups that traditionally have worked with the U.S. government to resettle refugees, said Mr. Trump's decision \"lowers our moral standing.\"",
      "\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.",
      "Officially created in 1980, the U.S. refugee program was designed to offer a safe harbor to people abroad fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, political views or membership in a social group.",
      "Before the second Trump administration took office, refugees were typically referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spent months or years in third-party countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being granted entry into the U.S. The process is distinct from the asylum system, which can be accessed by foreigners already on American soil, including those who enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "Over the past decades, most of those admitted into the U.S. as refugees have come from countries in Africa and Asia plagued by war, ethnic strife or repression of minority groups, State Department figures show.",
      "After refugee admissions plummeted to a record low of 11,000 in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 mostly due to Trump-era cuts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the Biden administration dramatically expanded the program.",
      "In fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, the highest level since the 1990s, according to government data. Officials stopped publishing refugee admissions data after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",

      "A toy replica of the Iranian Shahed drone, which Russia has extensively deployed to attack Ukraine, is being marketed to children on a Russian e-commerce website.",
      "A listing on the Ozon website, which is often dubbed the Russian Amazon, sells the small foam plastic drone as a replica of the Geranium-2, the Russian designation of the Iranian-made Shahed drone. The description lists the item as \"suitable for children ages 6 or older,\" and claims it develops \"coordination, accuracy and imagination.\" It is also describes it as \"an ideal gift for young patriots and future conquerors of the skies.\"",
      "The toy, which is sold for 350 Russian roubles (about $4.38) can also be fitted with firecrackers on the tip which explode on impact, emulating the way the real-life Shahed drones fly into their targets and explode on impact.",
      "Reviews for the product shown on the website all appear to be positive, with one commenter writing, \"Cool toy, my son is thrilled, I ordered more fireworks too.\"",
      "Another commenter wrote, \"Great toy! Just like the real thing!\"",
      "The long-range, Iranian-made Shahed drones have been widely used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where they have targeted civil, energy and transport infrastructure. Their relatively low cost and low altitude operation has made them a weapon of choice in the country's attacks on Ukraine since August 2022.",
      "A report issued in March by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Science and International Security said that over the course of seven months, from August last year to March this year, Russia launched some 15,000 Shahed-type unmanned aerial vehicles at Ukraine.",

    "summary": "While flying back to Washington on Air Force One after the meeting, Trump told reporters it was a \"great success\" and said he would head to China in April for new talks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he will cut U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after he sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a high-stakes summit in South Korea in the midst of a months-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\"On the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One while flying back to Washington from the South Korean city of Busan. He called his more than 90-minute session with Xi an \"amazing meeting\" and a \"great success.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a deal\" on trade, saying he expects to sign an agreement \"pretty soon,\" though he's likely to renegotiate it in future years. \"A lot of things we brought to finalization\" during Thursday's discussions, the president added, calling Xi a \"tremendous leader of a very powerful country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he decided to lower his overall tariff rate on imports of Chinese goods from 57% to 47%, after promises by Xi to curtail shipments of fentanyl ingredients to the U.S. Levies of 47%\u00a0would still leave China with one of the highest tariff rates the U.S. imposes.",
      "He also told reporters China will resume purchasing U.S. soybeans \"immediately\" after a boycott by China left Americans farmers reeling, and he said a conflict over Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports was \"settled.\" Details on those agreements remain sparse.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he would go to China in April for new talks, and Xi will \"be coming here sometime after that, whether it's in Florida, Palm Beach or Washington, D.C.\"",
      "The two leaders met on a South Korean military base at the tail end of an almost weeklong trip through Asia by Mr. Trump.",
      "Prior to the meeting, Mr. Trump said he has a good relationship with Xi \"but he's a very tough negotiator. That's not good.\"",
      "Xi said trade negotiators from both sides have made progress in addressing \"major concerns\" and he believes the U.S. and China should be \"partners and friends.\"",
      "\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye-to-eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" Xi said through an interpreter, though he noted that relations have been \"stable on the whole.\"",
      "China is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, behind only Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. buying $438.9 billion in Chinese goods last year, while China bought $143.5 billion in goods from the U.S. But Mr. Trump has pushed for higher tariffs on Chinese imports, both due to fentanyl trafficking and alleged unfair trade practices, sparking a trade war.",
      "The two sides briefly levied massive tit-for-tat tariffs on each other in April, before delaying those levies to buy time for negotiations. In August, Mr. Trump signed an executive action delaying the reinstatement of higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, extending the pause until mid-November.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have been holding trade talks for months leading up to Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to\u00a0impose an additional 100% tariff rate\u00a0on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 in retaliation for China's increased export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which would bring total tariffs on Chinese imports as high as 155%. China has the vast majority of the world's supply of those raw materials, critical for manufacturing in key technology areas like semiconductors and missiles. Those extra 100% tariffs are \"effectively off the table\" for now,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Bessent said he also expects Mr. Trump and Xi to sign a deal Thursday placing TikTok under majority U.S. ownership, although Chinese-owned ByteDance could still have a minority ownership stake of under 20%.",
      "Defense is another point of tension between China and the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's first secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he should commit to Taiwan's independence.",
      "\"Xi Jinping is expected to press President Trump for clarity about America's stance toward Taiwan at their meeting this week,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"America should oblige \u2014 and affirm our unequivocal commitment to Taiwan's sovereignty and independence from Beijing.\"",
      "But on the trip home, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Xi didn't discuss Taiwan.",
      "Separately, moments before the meeting with Xi began, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that he's directed the Pentagon\u00a0to restart nuclear weapons testing. And the president\u00a0said earlier Wednesday\u00a0that he will allow South Korea, a rival of China's, to develop a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "The last time Mr. Trump and Xi met in person was on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan in 2019, during Mr. Trump's first term in office, although the two leaders have spoken by phone. The last conversation the White House disclosed between the two men was on Sept. 19.",
      "Busan, known as an educational and cultural center along Korea's southeastern coast, is the second most populous city in South Korea behind its capital, Seoul. The Xi meeting is the final agenda item on Mr. Trump's schedule for his five-day Asia tour, concluding a trip primarily intended to strengthen economic ties and cement trade deals in the South Pacific region.",

      "The Brown family found the Schweppes-brand bottle just above the waterline at Wharton Beach near Esperance in Western Australia state on Oct. 9, Deb Brown said on Tuesday.",
      "Her husband Peter and daughter Felicity made the find during one of the family's regular quad bike expeditions to clear the beach of trash.",
      "\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Deb Brown said.",

      "Their troop ship HMAT A70 Ballarat had left the South Australia state capital Adelaide to the east on Aug. 12 of that year on the long journey to the other side of the world where its soldiers would reinforce the 48th Australian Infantry Battalion on Europe's Western Front.",
      "Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family says was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.",
      "Neville requested the bottle's finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.",

      "The ship was \"heaving and rolling, but we are as happy as Larry,\" Neville wrote, using a now faded Australian colloquialism meaning very happy.",
      "Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, \"Somewhere at Sea.\" Harley wrote that they were, \"Somewhere in the Bight,\" referring to the Great Australian Bight. That's an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.",
      "Soldier's granddaughter \"absolutely stunned\"",
      "Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn't travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.",
      "The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers' relatives of the find.",
      "The bottle \"is in pristine condition. It doesn't have any growth of any barnacles on it. I believe that if it had been at sea or if it had been exposed for that long, the paper would've disintegrated from the sun. We wouldn't have been able to read it,\" she said.",
      "Brown told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. she was happy the bottle was found by someone with a connection to the area.",
      "\"We've filled up ute loads and ute loads over the years out here, so we never go past a piece of rubbish,\" she told the ABC. \"We've picked up wine bottles from 10 years ago that might have a message in it, or something random.\"",
      "Harley's granddaughter Ann Turner said her family was \"absolutely stunned\" by the find.",
      "\"We just can't believe it. It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" Turner told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",

      "\"It sounds as though he was pretty happy to go to the war. It's just so sad what happened. It's so sad that he lost is life,\" Herbie Neville said.",
      "\"Wow. What a man he was,\" the great nephew added with pride.",

      "President Donald Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot this year, but New Jersey voters are sending him a message.\u00a0More are negative toward Trump than positive by 11 percentage points, and more than twice as many say their vote in this year\u2019s gubernatorial race will be to express opposition to the president rather than to show support.",
      "That helps Democrat Mikie Sherrill best Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 52% to 45% heading into the last few days of the campaign, according to a Fox News poll of New Jersey likely voters. Her 7-point lead is just outside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. Earlier this month, Sherrill was ahead by 5 points, and in September she was up by 8 points.",
      "FOX NEWS POLL: CAPITALISM REMAINS MORE POPULAR THAN SOCIALISM, YET MAJORITIES SUPPORT TAXING THE WEALTHY",
      "\"It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true, this race is all about turnout, so the big question is whether Trump supporters show up when he\u2019s not on the ballot,\" says Daron Shaw, a Republican who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Sherrill's supporters seem like they are going to turn out, but the evidence is mixed for those backing Ciattarelli. If the MAGA base comes around during this final weekend, the Democratic advantage\u00a0narrows considerably.\"",
      "This analysis is among likely voters.",
      "Among those who say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting this year, Ciattarelli is ahead by 5 points \u2013 but among those either extremely or very enthusiastic, it\u2019s Sherrill by 4.\u00a0That\u2019s because more Republicans feel extremely enthusiastic (52%) than Democrats (40%).",
      "Some 93% of Ciattarelli\u2019s backers feel certain they will vote for him compared to 91% for Sherrill, while 8% overall say they could switch their pick before voting.\u00a0Only 3% say they will vote for someone other than these two major party candidates or are undecided on their choice.",

Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who styled himself a \"populist conservative.\"",

COVID is over.\"",

The evaluation came from Nauto, Inc., creator of the Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment, or VERA Score. This system uses AI to measure fleet safety on a scale of 1 to 100.",
      "The Kodiak Driver earned a remarkable score of 98. That result placed it beside the safest human fleets in Nauto's global network. The findings sparked discussion across the trucking industry and raised new questions about the role of automation in freight transport.",

      "The Kodiak Driver, an autonomous trucking system powered by AI, earned a top VERA Score of 98 in a new safety evaluation. (Kodiak)",
      "Kodiak Driver's autonomous truck safety evaluation results",
      "Kodiak's VERA Score of 98 matched the highest rating among all fleets evaluated. Fleets with Nauto's safety technology average a score of 78, while those without the technology average only 63.",
      "The Kodiak Driver achieved perfect scores of 100 in inattentive driving, high-risk driving and traffic violations. Its lowest score, 95, came in aggressive driving. The VERA Score combines over 20 vision-based AI variables into one clear safety rating.",
      "Nauto found that every 10-point increase in VERA Score cuts collision risk by about 21%. A near-perfect score like Kodiak's represents a strong improvement over typical human performance on the road.",
      "The strong results didn't come as a surprise to Kodiak's leadership. Don Burnette, founder and CEO of Kodiak, told CyberGuy: \"Achieving the top safety score among more than 1,000 commercial fleets in Nauto's Visually Enhanced Risk Assessment (VERA Score\u00ae) proprietary safety benchmark is a testament to the Kodiak's focus on safety. Safety is at the foundation of everything Kodiak builds. Our core value is \u2018safety first and always.\u2019 We believe independent safety evaluations like Nauto's help to validate what we already know: the Kodiak Driver is already among the safest drivers on American highways. They also help to establish and build public awareness around how safe our technology truly is.\"",
      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: TRUMP, MUSK AIM FOR DOMINANCE",
      "The growing impact of AI on truck driving safety",
      "Nauto equipped the trucks with advanced monitoring and hazard detection systems. These tools track both the driving environment and vehicle behavior in real time. Removing human factors such as distraction, fatigue and delayed reaction directly improves safety.",
      "Burnette said in a company statement that the system \"is never drowsy, never drunk, and always paying attention.\" That constant awareness allows the Kodiak Driver to operate defensively and predictably, two traits linked to safe driving.",
      "The VERA Score also gives fleets a consistent way to measure safety. Companies can now shift from reacting to crashes to preventing them.",
      "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration data support the trend. U.S. commercial truck crashes dropped from more than 124,000 in 2024 to roughly 104,000 this year. Fewer crashes mean fewer fatalities and safer highways overall.",

      "Not everyone is ready to hand over the wheel to artificial intelligence. Some industry experts point out that while systems like the Kodiak Driver perform well in controlled evaluations, real-world roads can still pose unpredictable challenges. Weather, human drivers and mechanical issues remain complex variables for autonomous systems to manage.",
      "Others worry about the impact on jobs. As AI takes on more driving responsibilities, professional drivers wonder what the shift will mean for employment and pay across the trucking industry.",

      "Businesses could see big gains. AI-powered safety tools help cut liability, lower costs and keep fleets running smoothly. The technology doesn't need rest breaks or reminders to stay focused, which makes every mile more efficient.",
      "Regulators are also paying attention. Verified data like this builds trust and clears the way for safer, wider use of autonomous trucks. It's proof that technology can deliver real-world safety, not just promise it.",
      "Drivers on everyday roads benefit too. Fewer crashes mean safer highways and more reliable deliveries. When trucks drive smarter, everyone shares the reward. Human drivers aren't going anywhere soon, but AI is quickly becoming their most reliable partner. It helps prevent fatigue, distraction and those risky split-second decisions that lead to trouble.",

    "title": "How a tiny retinal implant is helping people regain their sight",
    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:00:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Revolutionary retinal implant restores central vision in 80% of patients with advanced macular degeneration, offering hope where treatments once only slowed blindness.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",
      "This breakthrough offers new hope for people living with advanced macular degeneration. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Passkey support by platform",
      "Works on\u00a0Windows 10 and 11.Windows 11 version 22H2 (KB5030310+) includes passkey management.Unlock with\u00a0Windows Hello PIN, face, or fingerprint.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Passkeys are a major upgrade over traditional passwords, but we're not living in an all-passkey world just yet. Many sites still rely on passwords, and you'll need backups if something happens to your device. Supplementing passkeys with a password manager is the best move right now; it lets you store, sync and protect both passkeys and passwords under one roof. The good news is that setting up passkeys takes just a few minutes, and once they're enabled, logging in becomes faster and more secure.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

      "Adding two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Set your software to update automatically so you are always protected when opening emails or clicking links.",
      "Make it a habit to log into your credit card accounts directly from the official website, not from email links. Scan your statements for unfamiliar transactions. Early detection helps you report fraud fast and recover funds before more damage is done.",
      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",
      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",

      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",

      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",
      "On its official website, the company includes a short disclaimer addressing the ethics of its technology. It states, \"Is it ethical to use AI generators to create images?

We encourage users to approach this with an understanding of responsibility and respect for others' privacy, ensuring that the use of undress app is done with full awareness of ethical implications.\"",

      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Haggard believes Lee has little political space to drift away from Washington. \"There is little chance that Lee will move significantly away from the focus on the alliance with the United States, even if some in his party would applaud such a move, because the vast majority of Korean people support strong ties with the United States, support a U.S. troop presence and understand that their future security relies on smooth relations with their only ally, the United States.\"",

      "At the same time, Haggard warned that economic policy differences could pose new challenges. \"Domestic economic policy in South Korea has traditionally been a source of friction but only peripherally because of the relatively small historical investment level into South Korea. As Korea's economy becomes more global and its companies become global leaders beyond their exports, differences in economic policy could become more troublesome to the bilateral relationship.\"",
      "He added that tighter regulation of foreign investment \"would likely cause frictions with the United States as the two countries seek to sign and implement a trade deal.\"",

      "It would be the second time the White House has been able to avoid missing a pay period for troops during the government shutdown, now in its 30th day. Service members are considered essential federal employees and are required to work during funding lapses, but essential workers typically aren't paid during shutdowns.",
      "About $2.5 billion from the military housing fund part of President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill, enacted this year, will be tapped for Friday's paychecks, according to the OMB official. In addition, $1.4 billion from the Pentagon's research and development account and $1.4 billion from its procurement account will be used, the official said.",
      "That would bring the total to about $5.3 billion, which is still less than the $6.5 billion that was drawn upon to pay for troops\u2019 paychecks earlier this month.

      "Earlier this week, on Capitol Hill, Vice President JD Vance said: \u201cWe believe that we can continue to pay the troops on Friday. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not going to be able to pay everybody, because we\u2019ve been handed a very bad hand by the Democrats.\"",
      "He added: \"We do think that we can continue paying the troops, at least for now, but we\u2019ve got food stamp benefits that are set to run out in a week. We\u2019re trying to keep as much open as possible. We just need the Democrats to actually help us out.\u201d",
      "Congressional Democrats have insisted that Republicans agree to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act to prevent premiums from doubling or even tripling for many Americans next year before voting to reopen the government. Republicans have argued that negotiations on that topic should take place after funding is restored for the entire federal government.",
      "The Senate last week failed to advance a Republican measure that would pay active-duty service members and other federal workers deemed essential during the shutdown. Senate Democrats offered an alternative measure that would pay all federal workers, but it also fell short of the votes needed to advance.",
      "Most federal workers have been furloughed during the shutdown, while others have been required to work without pay until the government reopens. Both groups are expected to be paid in full at the conclusion of the shutdown, which started Oct. 1.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who blames Democrats for lapses in pay, has repeatedly rejected efforts to call the House back into session to vote on measure that could fund critical parts of the government, saying Thursday that the \u201crifle shot bills that you keep hearing about deviates from the goal\u201d to reopen the government in its entirety.",

      "While Democrats have urged the Trump administration to release $5 billion in contingency funding to prevent SNAP benefits from drying up Saturday,  Johnson said this week that there was \u201cno such legal avenue\u201d for the president to dip into contingency funding for SNAP because the program\u2019s statutory language did not allow it."

      "Donors have been instructed to direct their ballroom contributions to the trust, a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.",
      "Individual and corporate donors can typically deduct the amount they contributed from their federal income taxes. A person raising money for the ballroom told NBC News that they have been asking for donations of $2.5 million to $5 million and that the deduction is one reason people choose to give. The fundraiser, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly. The White House said donors will be able to remain anonymous if they wish.",

      "Devoted to \"restoring, preserving and enriching the National Mall,\" the trust is now part of a project that is transforming the symbol of American history and power. Construction crews flattened the East Wing of the White House this month to make way for a ballroom that can seat nearly 1,000 people; in July, Trump said the addition wouldn\u2019t touch the White House.",

      "The group is an official partner of the National Park Service, the federal agency that maintains the White House grounds. Traditionally, the trust assists the Park Service by raising private money for projects, thus defraying the cost to taxpayers.",
      "Over the summer, the Park Service approached the trust and asked whether it would handle the private donations for the ballroom, a trust staff member said.",
      "The group\u2019s 14-member board discussed the request and agreed to take part, board member Eric Hoplin, who is CEO of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said in an interview.",

That year, she donated $250 to the Democratic presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, campaign finance records show.

      "The ballroom project has attracted donations from major companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and beyond. Comcast Corp., the parent company of NBCUniversal, was also on the White House list of donors.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d icon Suzanne Rogers has announced that she was diagnosed with Stage 2 colorectal cancer and recently underwent treatment.",
      "Rogers, who has portrayed Salem staple Maggie Horton for 52 years, opened up about her cancer diagnosis during an interview with TV Insider published Oct. 30, revealing that her health struggles are the reason for her absence from the show.",
      "The 82-year-old actor told the entertainment outlet that she decided to make an appointment with her doctor after feeling that something \u201cwasn\u2019t quite right\u201d despite getting routine colonoscopies. She had another and the surgeon suggested that she return for an MRI, PET scan and biopsy after seeing her results.",
      "\u201cAnd the minute he said that I knew that it was something more,\u201d she recalled.",
      "She learned after another procedure that she had Stage 2 colorectal cancer. Her doctor informed her, \u201c\u2018You have cancer and you have to start treatment,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Rogers added, \u201cIt was all a shock. I mean, I think I was in a shock for several days because I take pretty good care of myself. But he said, \u2018It\u2019s a good thing you caught it in time.\u2019\u201d",
      "She underwent treatment this summer after \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d finished filming in June.",
      "\u201cIt was radiation every day and chemo every day for six weeks and it was tough,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIt was tough knowing you had to do it five days a week and then you had off Saturday and Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends because I didn\u2019t have to go to and see a doctor. I was so tired of seeing doctors.\u201d",
      "Although she initially didn\u2019t disclose her diagnosis, she later turned to co-star Linsey Godfrey, who plays her on-screen daughter Sarah Horton, for support. She revealed Godfrey held her hand during one of her infusions, and that other co-stars, like Paul Telfer, Mary Beth Evans, Stephen Nichols, Greg Rikaart and AnnaLynne McCord, were there for her, too. Producers also told her to prioritize her health and that she could resume portraying Rogers when she improved.",
      "Her treatment ended on July 31. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really good,\u201d she told TV Insider. \u201cI start back to work next week, so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cNow, I\u2019m feeling anxious like I do any time I get scripts because I want to do my very best and you don\u2019t want to hold up anybody. So that\u2019s the only anxiousness I feel. It\u2019s not because of my illness, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d",
      "Rogers said that her recent health struggles have changed her perspective on life. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I used to worry about some silly things,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd when you go through this, it kind of takes you a while to say, \u2018OK, well, this is what I have, and I will do my very best to fight it and to get through it.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did. The prayers and the good wishes from my friends and my family helped me stay positive and stay on top of it and beat this.\u201d",
      "Her \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d family posted a message on Instagram about Rogers\u2019 diagnosis Oct 30 and told viewers they can expect to see Maggie on their televisions again soon.",
      "The show wrote, \u201cWe are delighted that Suzanne has come through this challenge with her trademark grace and strength. Fans will be glad to know that \u2018Maggie\u2019 will remain a constant presence in Salem.\u201d",
      "The post said Rogers\u2019 absence on the show in 2026 with me \u201cminimal.\u201d According to TV Insider, \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d films 10 months in advance.",
      "\u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d had previously commented on Rogers taking a hiatus from the show in July. The soap shared a statement with Soap Opera Digest at the time that addressed rumors Rogers was leaving, writing that the speculation, \u201ccould not be further from the truth, Maggie and Suzanne are integral to the show\u2019s history, present storylines, and now, on the heels of our pick-up, the future! Neither are going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Rogers has played Maggie on the beloved soap opera since 1973, totaling 3205 episodes according to IMDb. NBCUniversal confirmed that \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d has been renewed for seasons 62 and 63 on Peacock.",
      "Colorectal cancer develops in either the colon or the rectum, and about 3.9 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their life, the National Cancer Institute reports. Since 2018, the American Cancer Society has been recommending that patients start screening for colorectal cancer starting at the age of 45.",
      "NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar said on TODAY in May that colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death globally."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had the dream to have, to write and to work on an album, almost to the point that it became a little bit of a nightmare because I had a lot of expectations,\u201d the 30-year-old Venezuelan singer-songwriter tells TODAY.com. \u201cI was pressuring myself a lot, and it wasn\u2019t the moment for it, but I would keep (telling) myself, \u2018It\u2019s going to come and be awesome.\u2019",
      "\u201cI just had no clue what it was going to be,\u201d she adds, having now accomplished her dream with \u201cBendito Verano.\u201d",
      "An acclaimed Grammy and multi-Latin Grammy nominee, Elena Rose \u2014 whose given name is Andrea Elena Mangiamarchi \u2014 has penned hit songs for artists like Bad Bunny, even receiving a Grammy nod for her work on \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\" which became the first Spanish-language album to be nominated for album of the year.",
      "Then there's songwriting credits on Becky G's \u201cMamiii\" featuring Karol G, Jennifer Lopez and Maluma's \"Pa' Ti,\" \u201cDe Vuelta Pa\u2019 La Vuelta\u201d by Daddy Yankee and Marc Anthony, as well as hits with Selena Gomez, Rauw Alejandro and Christina Aguilera, among others.",
      "When it came to her own album, Elena Rose was inspired by her love of summer, a \"heavenly\" playlist, an Italian getaway and most importantly, trusting her intuition.",
      "The result was a deeply personal 12-track, genre-blending album that Elena Rose says made her \u201cfeel proud\" \u2014 and \u201ctranscended music.\u201d",
      "The \u201cfirst name that came to mind\u201d for her creation was Holy Summer, which she translated to Spanish.",
      "\u201cSummer is my favorite time of the year,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of summer, I think of a sunset, I think of the beach, I think of the breeze, I think of happiness. I think of dancing and just having a lot of moments where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this place is beautiful. Wow. I love the people I\u2019m with. Thank you, God, for my life. Thank you for the present.\u2019\u201d",
      "Collaborations with Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Beto Montenegro, Young Miko and Justin Quiles, as well as dreamy angelic music videos for each track, only enhanced her vision.",

      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I think after (my 2024 song) \u201cMe Lo Merezco\u201d (\u201cI Deserve It\u201d) was born, I was like, \u201cThis is where I\u2019m feeling the best,\u201d because it transcended the music and it became more about the message and what it was doing in people\u2019s lives.",
      "It was that feeling of, \u201cLook at everything we\u2019ve gone through and we made it. We\u2019re here at the beach, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d Mixing that feeling of what summer means to me and then asking the question of, \u201cIf there were to be a summer in heaven, what playlist would they play?\u201d",
      "Which is why we have sax, we have trumpets because I would picture angels performing in heaven. (I wanted this album) to help us remember the things that really matter ... and it would be about love.",
      "We have elements like Afro that make me feel freedom, that make me feel at peace, joy and be in the present. There\u2019s a lot of roots feelings when I listen to a bass line, or when I listen to the drums that remind me that I come from amazing people that have done amazing things in order for me to be here.",
      "But then I have my message, which is where I really come in and put like my little grain of salt. I speak about mental health and awareness and emotional responsibility and real and unconditional love.",
      "We went to Italy to record all the visuals. Every song has a visual. The first time I went to Italy, it was right after I picked up my relationship with my father. We hadn\u2019t spoken in like five years and my father is half Chilean, half Italian, but grew up in Venezuela.",
      "My last name is Italian, and I had always wanted to go to Italy, and I\u2019m grateful it happened right after we hugged it out. Visually, the woman that I saw in Italy was a woman hugging everything about where she comes from and who she is. (Someone) who never lost her essence, but really worked on the woman that she wants to be and who she wants to be for the world and her industry and her craft. I\u2019m grateful to see that visually. I needed to see it. And in a place like Italy, in Lake Como, the first thing that I thought was, \"If God wakes up in the morning and opens the window of his bedroom, this is the view.\"",
      "And then we recorded everything in Italy, aesthetically with this woman that you see vulnerability and innocence, but then you also see her strength and her resilience.",
      "The album opens up with a mantra that I wrote with my life coach that repeats, \"I am, I am.\" It\u2019s just one minute. I want people to start the days like that. It's how I start my days.",
      "The interlude was my best friend. I asked him, \u201cIf you could describe the warrior of light, how would you describe her?\u201d",
      "And then it closes with a song that I wrote to my inner child. It begins with my mom and my grandmother singing. So it\u2019s very, very intentional, just a big ball of love.",
      "I think every song has something like \u201cLuna de Miel\u201d (with Rawayana), to me, is the wedding song of the album. \u201cLa de Dios\u201d is the moment to connect with the purest part of your heart, your inner child, and also to connect with God. It\u2019s a reminder in a world that right now is in a lot of chaos.",
      "\u201cAleluya!\u201d tells you, love without fear. \u201cAlma\u201d tells you, look at everything that you\u2019ve gone through. You\u2019ve always had everything and if you lose whatever you have, you\u2019re losing nothing.",
      "\u201cAm\u00e9n Beb\u00e9,\u201d you have a partner and you build something together, a best friend, a boyfriend, a dog, celebrate life. There\u2019s a little bit of everything. I\u2019m just grateful that I have an album that I think you can listen from beginning to end, and it\u2019s gonna be an experience.",
      "I\u2019m excited, happy. This is my first US tour. We\u2019re going to be presenting the album. We\u2019re preparing a very intimate show, which is how I like it. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s gonna be way too long and people are gonna tell me, \u201cYou guys have to leave.\u201d And we\u2019re all gonna be like, \u201cNo!\u201d",
      "I\u2019m excited to see my warriors of light. They\u2019re everything to me. We feed each other and we exchange energy. We elevate each other, and I\u2019m bringing now a work that I put all my heart and soul (into), and I can\u2019t wait for you guys to listen to it."

      "Aniyah Saint-Surin was amped to secure pit tickets the day of Billie Eilish\u2019s first Miami show on Oct. 9. The 18-year-old says she walked into the concert at the Kaseya Center saying to herself, \u201cThis will be my time.\u201d",
      "Her prediction was right. Hours later, the high school senior would go viral for her fast-acting bravery and earn a name within Eilish\u2019s fandom: The \u201cred bandana girl.\u201d",
      "At the concert, Eilish stepped down from the stage and walked through the crowd, greeting fans with smiles and high-fives. Then came a shocking moment: Eilish\u2019s outstretched arm was yanked by concertgoer. He pulled her into the crowd on the other side of the barricade.",
      "The concertgoer has not been identified. The Miami police Department said in a police department that the individual was \u201cejected\u201d from the venue, NBC News reported. There are no criminal charges pending, police said.",
      "Saint-Surin witnessed the altercation happen. \u201cI just see her get swallowed below,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be walking past me, not down.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin was immediately disturbed by what had happened. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this just happened,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom somebody just doing that in front of me right.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin tried to help Eilish up, then noticed the person who had grabbed her was also standing nearby. Saint-Surin decided to confront him.",

      "Saint-Surin later spoke to Miami Police Department and showed her a video she had of the incident, which she posted Oct. 14 on her social media accounts.",
      "But she wasn\u2019t the only person who had captured the moment. Videos of Saint-Surin confronting the man started to circulate on social media, giving her the nickname \"red bandana girl.\"",
      "Fans found her TikTok account and jumped her following from 60 to about 700,000. Singer-songwriter FINNEAS, who is also Billie\u2019s older brother, posted on his Instagram story on Oct. 10, \u201cRed bandana girl from last night\u2019s show rules.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin realized she\u2019d gone viral at her high school\u2019s pep rally. Her \u201cmind started to crumble\u201d thinking of her followers. But the attention excited her, too. \u201cI\u2019m like yes, FINNEAS sees that I don\u2019t play about your sister,\u201d she says.",
      "Stubhub ended up inviting Saint-Surin to Eilish\u2019s Oct. 10 show, where she says she made eye contact with Eilish from the other side of the barricade. On Night 3, which she also attended, she says Eilish smiled at her. At the concerts, Saint-Surin got recognition of her own from fans who had seen the viral video.",
      "Saint-Surin is also grateful for the merch Eilish\u2019s team sent her as a \u201ctoken of appreciation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen she wrote me a note,\u201d she says. \u201cSo sweet.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Saint-Surin reflects on concert etiquette, especially at at time when behavior like concertgoers throwing things at performers is a trend. She hopes the moment encourages people to \u201cenforce more respect (toward) an artist when they\u2019re performing.\u201d",
      "As for what made her the type of person who would intervene when she sees \"disrespect,\" in her words?",
      "\u201cMama definitely raised me right, yes,\u201d she says."

      "It comes after revelations that Andrew was paying a rent of \"one peppercorn (if demanded) per annum\" on the 30-room mansion owned by the Crown Estate, despite having stepped back from public duties six years ago. The arrangement was revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request by The Times newspaper last week.",
      "The palace said: \"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.\"",

      "Inside each ampule is the substance at the heart of the geopolitical strife between the United States and China: fentanyl, the deadly opioid at the center of a deal outlined by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday.",
      "NBC News got exclusive access to the headquarters of Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical, the largest producer of the drug in China, and indeed Asia, at its sprawling complex in the central city of Yichang.",
      "Humanwell says that it only supplies fentanyl for use in hospitals and that it does not export any medication to the United States, Mexico or Canada. In 51 years of operating, \u201cwe have never had a single incident of a drug going missing \u2014 not a single dose has ever been lost,\u201d its president, Du Wentao, said in an interview inside his factory, which is surrounded by high fences wrapped in concertina wire and electric sensors.",
      "Humanwell is one of only five companies in China licensed to produce fentanyl for use in hospitals, and it makes around 100 million doses of fentanyl variants each year.",
      "After a strict registration process to get past the main gate, all visitors and staff alike \u2014 including the CEO \u2014 are required to wear blue hospital caps, shoe covers and lab coats to ensure they do not contaminate the workspace.",
      "Most of the production line is automated to limit human contact, with the vials being washed and sterilized and then filled with fentanyl using long rubber tubes.",
      "Two staffers in protective gear supervised the process, with an alarm pinging every 10 minutes to remind them to spray their gloved hands with disinfectant. The vials are then inspected using flashes of light, stamped, boxed up and shipped out via a warehouse.",
      "Trump pressed Xi for a crackdown on fentanyl at a meeting in South Korea on Thursday, the last stop of his three-country Asian tour. The president said he would reduce his fentanyl tariff on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, after Xi agreed to intensify China\u2019s efforts to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid.",
      "American officials say the Chinese government hasn\u2019t done enough to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl, which are then processed into the highly addictive opioid in Mexican labs and smuggled across the border to the United States. Though deaths appear to be declining in the U.S., fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "China has previously defended its anti-fentanyl efforts and says unrelenting American demand for the drug is to blame for the crisis.",
      "But a State Department report to Congress last month accused the ruling Chinese Communist Party of continuing to \u201csubsidize and otherwise incentivize China-based companies to export synthetic drug precursors, including through tax rebates, monetary grants and awards, and official site visits.\u201d It accused companies controlled by the Communist Party of being \u201ccomplicit in this illicit trade.\u201d",
      "Under pressure from Trump, China made fentanyl a controlled substance in 2019, banning its use outside of medical prescriptions. That slowed the influx of Chinese fentanyl into the U.S., but the \u201cprolific export of chemical precursors and other illicit narcotics remains,\u201d the State Department report said.",
      "Chinese officials rejected that narrative. \u201cChina expresses sympathy for the American people suffering from the fentanyl crisis,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "But he added that \u201cChina is the country most resolute in drug control, with the most comprehensive policies and the best track record. It is also one of the countries with the largest number of controlled substances and the strictest regulations in the world.\u201d",
      "Du, the president of Humanwell Healthcare, which produces 100 million doses annually of fentanyl-based products, says that the meticulously clean, automated and controlled operation observed by NBC News was no facade.",
      "\u201cThe management of fentanyl drugs in China is among the strictest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely no possibility that any dose from our company has flowed to the United States. I can state this with full confidence and certainty \u2014 there is no issue whatsoever.\u201d",
      "He derided the \"many statements in the U.S. claiming that the fentanyl crisis originates from China,\" saying that is impossible \"given how strict our controls are.\"",
      "As well as the visit to Humanwell, NBC News gained exclusive access to the National Narcotics Intelligence Center in Beijing, which had been sanctioned by Washington in 2020 but saw those measures lifted three years later during the Biden administration as the two countries agreed to resume cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "There, Chinese security officials said the two sides are again exchanging information on how smugglers alter their tactics.",
      "Fentanyl precursors are \"indeed one of our main concerns because drug synthesis techniques and methods are constantly evolving,\" lab director Hua Zhendong told NBC News.",
      "\"We have not found such processing plants domestically,\" he said, so \"most of the relevant information comes from technical exchanges with U.S. counterparts.\"",
      "Hua said the latest precursor chemicals identified by the U.S. \u201care added to our monitoring list so we can strengthen our attention to these substances.\"",
      "He said that banning all fentanyl products outside medical use in 2019 had \"effectively curbed illegal production and trafficking.\"",
      "U.S. officials say that's not the case. As Washington and Beijing seek common ground on the issue, experts say halting the illicit flow of fentanyl components is easier said than done.",
      "\u201cI think there is an assumption here that if the Chinese really wanted to shut off these precursors, they could do it,\u201d said Michael Swaine, a senior research fellow in the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington-based think tank, speaking ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "The problem, he said, is that there is no \u201cset number\u201d of precursors to fentanyl.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a clear list of specific items that you would be able to easily interdict,\u201d Swaine said. \u201cAnd a lot of them, of course, are very dual-use items.\u201d",
      "So while there might be a \u201csymbolic effort\u201d to deal with the fentanyl issue after the Trump-Xi meeting, he said, \u201cI don't think that this is going to go completely away.\u201d"

The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, will hold its grand opening ceremony on Saturday.",
      "Details about the event are a closely guarded secret, but on a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony will be the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",

This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",

      "Even Xi, before sitting down with Trump in South Korea for their first meeting since Trump returned to office, told the president that China\u2019s development \u201cgoes hand in hand with your vision to make America great again.\u201d",
      "Trump said the meeting with Xi, which lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, was \u201camazing,\u201d rating it a \u201c12\u201d on a scale of zero to 10.",
      "The warm embrace of Trump during the trip marked a contrast to the months of tense negotiations that preceded it. The administration had pushed ahead with a series of punishing tariffs as part of a broader effort to reset trade relationships.",
      "Rates for key U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, now at 15%, are below those imposed on other countries but still high by historical standards, and have greatly strained ties.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was signed between the Japanese government and the American government on tariffs is so unbelievably one-sided,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \u201cAnd the American side has sort of been trumpeting that fact.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, a South Korean mayor flew to Washington to protest Trump\u2019s tariffs outside the White House, saying 50% levies on steel in particular were pushing his steelmaking hub of Pohang to the brink of collapse.",
      "Pohang is only about 30 minutes from Gyeongju, where Trump met with South Korean officials Wednesday to finalize a trade deal with the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Trump said that a trade deal had been \u201cpretty much finalized,\u201d the details of which were later confirmed by a senior South Korean official.",
      "The U.S.-South Korea trade deal comes less than two months after more than 300 South Korean workers were escorted in chains from a Hyundai plant in Georgia during a raid by U.S. immigration officials, a shocking sight that humiliated Koreans.",
      "The image aired continuously on news programs in South Korea, which only weeks earlier had pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment. The workers later returned home without charges to cheers and protests, and a conciliatory message from Trump, who said he wanted foreign companies \u201cto bring their people of expertise\u201d into the country and didn\u2019t want to \u201cfrighten off\u201d investment.",
      "Leaders this week signaled that they were ready to move past the friction. Takaichi signed framework agreements with the U.S. to secure a supply of rare earths and on nuclear power reactors, and even told Trump that she is considering a purchase of Ford F-150s for government work even though they are widely considered too big for Japanese streets. Trump responded by offering her \u201canything you want.\u201d",
      "Addressing business executives in Gyeongju, Trump reflected on the differences between corporate dealmaking and heads-of-state diplomacy. He said he never believed in the idea of a win-win deal, but has since learned to search for balance.",
      "\u201cIt really is a little bit different than you\u2019re doing a business deal, and you want to just rip their hearts out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut when you have nations, it\u2019s a little bit different. You\u2019ve got to all balance out a little bit.\u201d",
      "The president, who has long touted his negotiating acumen from the business world, spent the week emphasizing stronger partnerships and better balance in U.S. trade relationships.",
      "He said after meeting with Xi that he was lowering fentanyl-related tariffs to 10% from 20% in exchange for greater efforts by China to stem the illicit international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid. The two leaders also reached an agreement to delay Chinese export curbs on strategically crucial rare earth materials.",
      "Trump \u201cseems to have an affinity for President Xi, and I think that he seems to think of Xi not as an avatar of imperial ambition, but rather as the head of an impressive rival business company,\u201d said Ali Wyne, an adviser on U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "Trump mused over how fast it had all come together.",
      "\u201cCan you believe it? One year ago, I was campaigning to win. Can you imagine that?\u201d Trump said in South Korea this week. \u201cHere I am president. We\u2019ve done so many different things, economically, militarily, peace-wise. You know \u2014 peace through strength.\u201d"

      "\u201cA lot of finalization,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One after he departed Busan, South Korea, where he met Thursday with Xi for about an hour and 40 minutes, saying he would rate the \u201camazing\u201d meeting a \u201c12\u201d on a scale from zero to 10.",

      "Trump said that he would visit China in April and that Xi would visit either Florida or Washington \u201csome time after that.\u201d",
      "Here are the main takeaways from the summit:",
      "Fentanyl",
      "Trump said he was lowering fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% from 20%, effective immediately. He said that would bring the total effective tariff rate on Chinese imports to 47% from 57%.",
      "Trump said he trusts Xi will \u201cwork very hard\u201d to stop the illicit flow of fentanyl precursors, the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid, from China to other countries. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a big difference,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. officials say China has not done enough to stop the illegal export of the precursor ingredients, which are processed into fentanyl in Mexican labs and then smuggled into the United States.",
      "China has rejected the accusations, calling its anti-fentanyl efforts the \u201cmost relentless\u201d in the world.",
      "Rare earth materials",
      "A key issue in U.S.-China trade negotiations has been rare earth materials, which are crucial for making magnets that go in everything from turbines to electric vehicles.",
      "China, which has a near-monopoly on the global supply, rattled automakers around the world when it imposed strict export controls on the materials, saying it was trying to snuff out their military use, and it has since used them as a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks.",
      "Trump said Xi had agreed to a one-year reprieve on the curbs that is likely to be \u201croutinely extended.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of the rare earth has been settled, and that\u2019s for the world,\u201d he said. A White House official standing alongside him said Trump and Xi had come to \u201can understanding\u201d and that China is \u201cnot going to impose the rare earth controls that they proposed.\u201d",
      "Analysts say even though the United States is pushing to reduce its reliance on China for the materials \u2014 with Trump signing critical minerals agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Japan on this trip \u2014 it will be a while before that happens.",
      "\u201cBuilding new mines and, especially, expanding processing capacity \u2014 which is the real bottleneck \u2014 requires years of sustained effort and substantial investment,\u201d Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told NBC News.",
      "Soybeans",
      "Trump said China, which resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans ahead of the meeting after having boycotted them for months, would purchase \u201clarge, tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China would buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between now and January as part of an agreement to purchase 25 million metric tons annually for three years.",
      "The halt in purchases from China, the biggest market for U.S. soybeans, has been a major pain point for American farmers, who have been pressing the Trump administration to resolve the issue.",
      "China had not purchased any U.S. soybeans since May, sourcing instead from South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil.",
      "\"Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that\u2019s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,\u201d Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d",
      "Ukraine",
      "Trump has long vowed to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, but after having faced resistance from Russia, he has turned to the Kremlin\u2019s close partners for help: India and China.",
      "The United States and China will \u201cwork together\u201d on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said, adding, \u201cUkraine came up very strongly; we talked about it for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,\u201d he said.",
      "Taiwan and Nvidia",
      "Asked about Taiwan, Trump told reporters that he and Xi didn\u2019t talk about the Beijing-claimed island democracy during their meeting. \u201cTaiwan never came up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not discussed, actually.\u201d",
      "When it came to the American artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be worth $5 trillion, Trump said there was no discussion as to whether the United States would further relax its export curbs to allow the export of Nvidia\u2019s latest chips, called Blackwell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Blackwell chips,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The United States allows limited exports of the older H20 GPU chips, which are a modified version specially designed for the Chinese market.",
      "TikTok",
      "Trump did not address the proposed TikTok deal between the United States and China after the meeting, but it appears China approved it during Trump\u2019s Asia trip.",
      "Under a U.S. law that was passed last year based on national security concerns, the popular Chinese-owned app must sell its U.S. operations to a U.S. owner.",
      "Earlier in the week, Bessent said a TikTok deal might be finalized during the meeting between Trump and Xi. After the meeting, Bessent told Fox Business Network that China had approved a deal during talks in Kuala Lumpur and that other finalizations for the deal would occur over the next weeks and months.",
      "After the meeting, the spokesperson for China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the country agreed \u201cto work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,\u201d according to a translation."

      "\u201cTrade should remain the ballast and propeller of China-U.S. relations, not a stumbling block or source of conflict,\u201d Xi said according to a readout released by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "The meeting in South Korea between the two leaders, their first since Trump returned to the White House, lasted about an hour and 40 minutes and was the climax of Trump\u2019s three-country Asia tour.",
      "Some issues were not addressed at all, Trump said, including the status of Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, some White House aides had worried that Trump might shift long-standing U.S. policy on the island in exchange for concessions from China, NBC News reported earlier this week.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump called Xi a longtime friend and \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d His Chinese counterpart acknowledged \u201cfrictions\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, saying that \u201cgiven our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye.\u201d",

      "Both Trump and Xi wanted the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the planning said beforehand.",
      "Still, Trump is continuing a long-standing practice of meeting with allies before Beijing, which former Assistant Secretary of State Dave Stilwell said indicates that the U.S. is not going to trade its alliance commitments for a deal with China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s five-day trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, he signed agreements with all three countries, as well as Thailand and Cambodia; made new foreign investment announcements; and proclaimed that tariff leverage can drive warring parties to stand down.",
      "Reflecting on his approach, Trump said going against the grain can sometimes deliver results.",
      "\u201cOftentimes you\u2019ll go the opposite way of almost everybody, and you\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s right, and the others will be the one that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in Gyeongju, South Korea, offering a peek into his thinking. \u201cThat\u2019s where you have your greatest successes.\u201d",
      "Miles Yu, a former State Department adviser on China, said the U.S. and Beijing are \u201csizing each other out\u201d with trade now a key battleground issue. Washington is pushing for concrete steps on fentanyl, market access and more, he said, while China \u201cstonewalls and foot-drags\u201d and offers only broad \u201cframeworks.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the root cause of the five rounds of futile negotiations so far with China without a breakthrough,\u201d Yu said, adding that the administration is trying to shift China\u2019s approach by rallying its neighbors, a strategy that he said \u201cmay or may not work.\u201d",
      "After talks with Chinese counterparts in Malaysia last weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said negotiators had shaped a framework for Trump and Xi to consider that spanned tariffs, trade, fentanyl, rare earths and \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of U.S. agricultural products.",
      "He credited Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff with creating leverage and said he believed that the framework would avoid that outcome and open space for tackling other issues.",
      "Xi said Thursday that the framework agreed to in Malaysia had \u201cprovided the necessary conditions for our meeting today.\u201d",
      "Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said Trump deserved credit for pursuing a pragmatic China policy that maintained what he said was strategic ambiguity while taking steps to restore important military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression.",
      "\u201cA lot of folks wanted to assume that he was going to be reflexively hawkish on China,\u201d Caldwell said of Trump. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d",
      "But Caldwell cautioned against expecting a breakthrough in Busan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall push hinges on one meeting,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIdeally, these go well, but the whole thing does not hinge on just one set of talks.\u201d",

      "The aides have privately expressed concern that Trump, who is pushing to reach a sweeping trade deal with China, may choose to ignore their advice, the people with knowledge of the discussions said.

Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."

    "summary": "The Burevestnik is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile announced in 2018 by Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",
      "Others see Putin's announcement as a response to sanctions this month by the European Union and Trump.",
      "Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did little to disabuse this idea when asked about it during his daily news briefing Monday.",
      "\"Ensuring security is a vital issue for Russia, especially given the militaristic sentiment we are currently hearing primarily from Europeans,\" he said.",
      "\"Despite all our openness to establishing a dialogue with the United States, Russia, first of all, and the president of Russia, is guided by our own national interests,\" Peskov added.",
      "Some observers, such as Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project, part of Norway's University of Oslo, were not too concerned.",
      "\u201cI celebrate every ruble Russia invests in this useless and unnecessary missile,\u201d he posted to X."

      "Two suspects with histories of jewel thefts had been tracked for days after their DNA was recovered from the museum and were arrested Saturday shortly before one of them was set to board a flight out of the country, a police official told NBC News.",
      "The breakthrough came a week after robbers broke into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatening guards and drilling into display cases before escaping on scooters with eight of France\u2019s crown jewels worth an estimated $102 million.",
      "A major police operation has been underway to track down the thieves, who were captured fleeing on camera. But there was still no sign of the jewels themselves.",
      "Police said DNA samples discovered at the crime scene helped identify the suspects.",
      "\"They left gloves, a walkie-talkie, a vest and a can of gasoline,\" Axel Ronde, spokesman for the French police union CFTC, said in an interview Monday.",
      "\"And that allowed my colleagues from the forensic team to find these DNA traces,\" he said.",
      "Ronde added that the two arrested suspects are men in their 30s, who had prior convictions and were known to police as having previously targeted jewelry stores.",
      "They are both from Aubervilliers, a suburb in northeast Paris, Ronde said. He said police decided to move in on Saturday when it became clear that one suspect was planning to flee to Algeria. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport 40 minutes before the flight was due to take off.",
      "While police can hold suspects for up to 48 hours without charge, in organized crime investigations like this one, detention can be extended to 96 hours.",
      "\"I think there is going to be more arrests quickly,\" said Robert Wittman, a former FBI art crime investigator.",
      "He added that the arrest of the first suspects would allow police to gather more evidence through searches of their homes and cellphone data.",
      "While investigators worry that the thieves may melt down or dismantle the jewels to sell them off as soon as possible, there remains hope that the stolen artifacts can be recovered intact.",
      "Wittman said the thieves may have good reason to preserve the jewels rather than destroy them right away.",
      "\"In places like France, and Europe, they can use those to get out of jail free,\" he said, adding that destroying the jewels would leave the thieves with no \"bargaining tools\" if they were arrested.",
      "Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators continued to search for the stolen jewels and the remaining suspects but that it was \"too early\" to provide the public with any more detail.",
      "\"I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody,\u201d she said, adding that she did not want to hinder the investigation.",

      "Beccuau, whose office is leading the probe, condemned leaks appearing in French media, saying that \u201chasty disclosure of this information by individuals who had knowledge of it, without any consideration for the investigation\u201d could hinder progress.",

      "\u201cThe wrongdoers who took these gems won\u2019t earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\u201d Beccuau said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \u201cWe can perhaps hope that they\u2019ll think about this and won\u2019t destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\u201d",
      "The Louvre theft has struck at the heart of France\u2019s national pride, wounding a country that sees its cultural heritage as a matter of identity and raising uncomfortable questions about how the world\u2019s most visited museum was breached so easily.",
      "The thieves parked a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift \u2014 and used it to access a second-floor balcony, seemingly without drawing the attention of police or security. The incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
