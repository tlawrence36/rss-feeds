      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d kept on smoldering at the box office, taking the top spot for a fourth straight week on a relatively quiet weekend as the January doldrums began setting in for the industry.",
      "The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic brought in $21.3 million in North American theaters for The Walt Disney Co., according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "In total after four weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has grossed $342.6 million in North America and $888 million in the rest of the world. Last week it joined its two predecessors as a billion-dollar earner.",

      "Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has shown remarkable staying power since its November release. It continues to be a global juggernaut and a sensation in China. Globally, the animated sequel has piled up $1.65 billion. That put it just on the edge of becoming Disney\u2019s highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only the $1.66 billion brought in by 2019's photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d",
      "In its seventh week, it was fourth at the North American box office with $10.1 million for a domestic total of $378.8 million.",
      "The Sydney Sweeney-driven thriller \u201cThe Housemaid\u201d continues to be a good earner for Lionsgate, which earlier this week greenlit a sequel. It collected $11.2 million in North America in its fourth weekend for a total of $94.15 million after costing just $35 million to make.",
      "The figures came on a Sunday when much of Hollywood's attention is on the Golden Globe Awards. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d are nominated for two awards apiece.",
      "But among contenders in top categories at the Globes, only A24's \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is in this weekend's box office top 10, finishing sixth with a $7.6 million take and a $70.1 million four-week total in North America.",
      "It's nominated for best picture musical or comedy, with star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet nominated for best actor in a comedy and cowriter and director Josh Safdie nominated for best screenplay.",
      "On the whole, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Revenues this weekend were up 23% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore. And the 2026 total so far is also up 23% from last year.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide.

      "A celebratory mood might be even more elusive given that the wide majority of the performers and filmmakers congregating at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, oppose the policies of President Donald Trump.

      "Weir\u2019s death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\u201d a statement on his Instagram posted Saturday said. \u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "Weir joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.",

      "\u201cFor over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\u201d the Instagram statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024.

      "Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead\u2019s 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia\u2019s in later years.",

      "The room reflected that mood. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg was spotted chatting with Coogler, whose wife and \u201cSinners\" producer, Zinzi Coogler, stood beside him. Meanwhile, Michael B. Jordan worked the room, trading hugs and handshakes with fellow honorees and guests including \"Bugonia\" star Jesse Plemons and \u201cTask\u201d actor Mark Ruffalo.

      "On the red carpet, with \u201cDeath by Lightning\u201d actor Nick Offerman beside him, George Clooney shared laughs with a photographer, adding to the easygoing tone that carried throughout the afternoon. After the event, Infiniti and Jordan reunited for a hug and a brief catch-up, a quiet moment that underscored the camaraderie in the room.",

      "K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Two things can be true at once. K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture, and it has long been undercelebrated at institutions like the Grammys \u2014 where K-pop artists have performed but have never taken home a trophy.",
      "That could change at next month's 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony. Songs released by K-pop artists \u2014 or K-pop-adjacent artists, more on that later \u2014 have received nominations in the big four categories for the first time. Ros\u00e9, perhaps best known as one-fourth of the juggernaut girl group Blackpink, is the first K-pop artist to ever receive a nomination in the record of the year field for \u201cAPT.,\u201d her megahit with Grammys' favorite Bruno Mars.",
      "The song of the year category also features K-pop nominees for the first time. \u201cAPT.\u201d will go head-to-head with the fictional girl group HUNTR/X's \u201cGolden,\u201d performed by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack.",
      "And the girl group Katseye, the brain child of HYBE \u2014 the entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS and countless other international acts \u2014 fashioned in the image of the K-pop idol system, has been nominated for best new artist.",
      "It depends on who you ask.",
      "Areum Jeong, assistant professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University and author of \u201cK-pop Fandom: Performing Deokhu from the 1990s to Today\u201d says the majority of these nominations strike her more as \u201ca de-territorialized, hybrid idea of K-pop,\u201d instead of a recognition of K-pop.",
      "While Ros\u00e9 \u201cwas recruited and trained under the K-pop system, and while \u2018APT.\u2019 does contain some motifs from the Korean drinking game,\u201d Jeong says, \u201cthe song does not feel like a localized K-pop production. \u2026 Same with Katseye, who was trained and produced under HYBE but marketed more toward Western fans and listeners.\u201d",
      "Jeong says that both \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye's \u201cGabriela\u201d \u2014 both of which will go head-to-head with \u201cGolden\u201d in the pop duo/group performance category \u2014 \u201cseem less K-pop than other K-pop songs that could have been nominated over the years.\u201d",
      "She argues the same is true for the music of \u201cKpop Demon Hunters.\u201d \u201cIt is very similar to \u2018APT.\u2019 in that it takes inspiration and motif from Korean culture,\u201d where \u201cK-pop serves as an idea, a jumping-off point, or a motif, creating alternatives or new possibilities.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Berbiguier, a visiting assistant professor in Korean Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that these nominations differ from past K-pop Grammy nominations because \u201cGolden,\u201d \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye all feature \u201ca mainstream popular music factor.\u201d",
      "That's the connection of a massive popular Netflix film (\u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d), a collaboration with Bruno Mars (\u201cAPT.\u201d), and Katseye's international membership and Netflix series (\u201cPop Star Academy: Katseye\u201d), respectively.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that K-pop is not considered as something niche anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, when we think about pop music in general, we also think of K-pop as part of it.\u201d",
      "Bernie Cho, industry expert and president of the South Korean agency, the DFSB Kollective, agrees that there is an international, mainstream appeal to the nominees.",
      "\u201cAll the nominees represent a sort of post-idol K-pop, in the sense that Ros\u00e9, the three ladies of HUNTR/X and Katseye represent the globalized version of K-pop, where the \u2018K\u2019 is very much there, but some people might argue it\u2019s silent. The songs are not necessarily for Korea, by Korea, from Korea, just kind of beyond Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration and testament to how diverse and dynamic K-pop has become.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the Recording Academy has snubbed K-pop acts that have set record-breaking standards, such as BTS,Seventeen and Stray Kids,\u201d argues Jeong. \u201cI think one of the main reasons is that the Western world is still so resistant to non-English lyrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does not surprise me that \u2018APT.\u2019 and Katseye\u2019s music, which mainly contain English lyrics and seem less K-pop, were nominated,\u201d she continues.",

Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says many critics and industry voices found 2025 to be a lackluster year for new pop music in the U.S. \u2014 a fact that was all but confirmed in Luminate's 2025 Mid-Year Report, which found that streams of new music had slowed compared to the year prior, potentially due to a dearth of megahits dominating the charts.",
      "\u201cYes, it's a big moment for K-pop, but it is so overdue, these recognitions are more of a sign of how poorly the music industry in the U.S. did this year that we're looking externally,\u201d she says.",
      "She argues that acknowledgment of Korean entertainment from U.S. entertainment industries is more symbolic of U.S. cultural dominance slipping than \u201cK-pop being really good, because K-pop has been really good for a really long time,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all recognition of just global storytelling improvement, global taste-making improvement.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to diminish it,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese are all universally friendly, accessible, good pop songs.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes and no,\u201d offers Herman. For her, it depends on an evolving and fluid definition of K-pop. After all, HUNTR/X is a fictional girl group from an animated film that did not debut through the K-pop music industry system. Would a victory for their song \u201cGolden\u201d mean a victory of K-pop? That's a matter of opinion.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

      "Something similar could be said of Tony, who rapidly emerges as a kind of folk hero. As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",
      "\u201cI think of her as like a basketball coach,\u201d says LaNasa of Dana. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at what\u2019s going on, and what do people need to do their best? \u2026 I have children that are 24 years apart in age and so, I feel like I\u2019ve just been mothering my whole life.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s been the toughest nut to crack,\u201d Glaser, who's hosting Sunday's Globes, said Tuesday with a determined laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to crack it.\u201d",
      "The comedian got the hosting gig last year after showing her skill at ruthlessly roasting celebrities. She got raves for her monologue. She brought out the knives, but they weren\u2019t overly sharp. She was promptly asked back.",
      "Sunday's monologue will be a shape-shifting monster until the moment the CBS telecast starts and she takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton, ideally with a bit ready for Roberts, who's nominated for best actress in a drama for \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d She'll be sitting in front of Glaser with her star-powered charm.",
      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",

      "The House is pushing ahead with legislation to renew subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Overpowering Speaker Mike Johnson, a bipartisan coalition in the House voted Wednesday to push forward a measure that would revive an enhanced pandemic-era subsidy that lowered health insurance costs for roughly 22 million people, but that had expired last month.",
      "The tally of 221-205 was a key test before passage of the bill, which is expected Thursday. And it came about because four GOP centrist lawmakers joined with Democrats in signing a so-called discharge petition to force the vote. After last year's government shutdown failed to resolve the issue, they said doing nothing was not an option as many of their constituents faced soaring health insurance premiums beginning this month.",

      "In the end, nine Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure.",
      "If ultimately successful in the House this week, the voting would show there is bipartisan support for a proposed three-year extension of the tax credits that are available for those who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The action of forcing a vote has been an affront to Johnson and GOP leaders, who essentially lost control of their House majority as the renegade lawmakers joined Democrats for the workaround.",
      "But the Senate is under no requirement to take up the bill.",
      "Instead, a small group of members from both parties is working on an alternative plan that could find support in both chambers and become law. One proposal would be to shorten the extension of the subsidy to two years and make changes to the program.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said any plan passing muster in the Senate will need to have income limits to ensure that it's focused on those who most need the help and that beneficiaries would have to at least pay a nominal amount for their coverage.",

Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie, all from Pennsylvania, and Lawler signed the Democrats' petition, pushing it to the magic number of 218 needed to force a House vote. All four represent key swing districts whose races will help determine which party takes charge of the House next year.",
      "Johnson, R-La., had discussed allowing more politically vulnerable GOP lawmakers a chance to vote on bills that would temporarily extend the subsidies while also adding changes such as income caps for beneficiaries. But after days of discussions, the leadership sided with the more conservative wing of the party\u2019s conference, which has assailed the subsidies as propping up a failed program.",

      "As a widow, she\u2019s been threatened with eviction for years by her late husband's family, who claim she has no inheritance rights. This year they filed a lawsuit, and the 70-year-old Anyango has no legal representation.",
      "She pointed out where her husband is buried, a few steps from the door.",
      "\u201cWhere do I take the grave?\" she asked softly.",
      "Anyango is among thousands of widows in western Kenya who face losing everything after their husbands die. They are often in rural areas and with little education, unaware of their rights.",
      "In the Luo, Luhya, and Kisii ethnic groups, widowhood can come with certain cultural expectations that can be considered illegal. One is \u201csexual cleansing,\u201d in which a widow is made to have sex with another man, often a brother of her late husband, in the belief that the \u201cdark cloud\u201d of widowhood will lift.",
      "Another is \u201cwife inheritance,\u201d in which a widow is taken in as a wife by her late husband\u2019s brother.",
      "Those who refuse, like Anyango and others who spoke with The Associated Press, are often isolated and stripped of their land, a violation of Kenya's constitutional guarantee of the right to land ownership for all citizens.",
      "\u201cIf the woman is not aware of what protects her, then she will be disinherited,\u201d said Simiyu Waddimba, who teaches anthropology at the University of Nairobi and authored a paper on wife inheritance.",
      "But in November, the local assembly in Siaya County, where Anyango lives, unanimously passed a Widows Protection Bill. If signed by the governor, it will criminalize forced disinheritance or forced remarriage.",
      "The legislation was championed by county legislator Scholastica Madowo, herself a widow and one of four elected women in the 42-member local assembly. She said the \u201catrocities that the women go through\u201d inspired her to act.",
      "\u201cThose cultural practices are actually a violation of their rights unless the woman does it willingly,\u201d she said.",
      "While Madowo wasn't forcibly disinherited or remarried, she faced opponents' insinuations about her widowhood during her campaign for office, including allegations that she had killed her husband.",
      "Her bill would establish welfare committees to help widows access legal aid to challenge disinheritance.",
      "In neighboring Kisii County, Anne Bonareri was stripped of her home and her commercial property, which had been in her late husband's name.",
      "Within hours of her husband's death in 1997, her in-laws also took his possessions, including photos and clothes. Bonareri was left with three young children and another on the way.",
      "\u201cThey took everything, and I was left with one photo of the father,\u201d the 60-year-old recalled, her voice catching.",

      "The plan calls for Leo to also visit the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off northwest Africa. The islands experience large numbers of migrant arrivals from West Africa. While Francis had long declined to visit the Spanish mainland, he had had hoped to visit the Canary Islands as part of his longstanding outreach to migrants and refugees.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has denounced how nations are increasingly using force to assert their dominion worldwide",
      "VATICAN CITY -- In his most substantial critique of U.S., Russian and other military incursions in sovereign countries, Pope Leo XIV on Friday denounced how nations were using force to assert their dominion worldwide, \u201ccompletely undermining\u201d peace and the post-World War II international legal order.",
      "\u201cWar is back in vogue and a zeal for war is spreading,\u201d Leo told ambassadors from around the world who represent their countries\u2019 interests at the Holy See.",
      "Leo didn\u2019t name individual countries that have resorted to force in his lengthy speech, the bulk of which he delivered in English in a break from the Vatican\u2019s traditional diplomatic protocol of Italian and French. But his speech came amid the backdrop of the recent U.S. military operation in Venezuela to remove Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power, Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and other conflicts.",
      "The occasion was the pope\u2019s annual audience with the Vatican diplomatic corps, which traditionally amounts to his yearly foreign policy address.",
      "In his first such encounter, history\u2019s first U.S.-born pope delivered much more than the traditional roundup of global hotspots. In a speech that touched on threats to religious freedom and the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to abortion and surrogacy, Leo lamented how the United Nations and multilateralism as a whole were increasingly under threat.",
      "\u201cA diplomacy that promotes dialogue and seeks consensus among all parties is being replaced by a diplomacy based on force, by either individuals or groups of allies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe principle established after the Second World War, which prohibited nations from using force to violate the borders of others, has been completely undermined.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, peace is sought through weapons as a condition for asserting one\u2019s own dominion. This gravely threatens the rule of law, which is the foundation of all peaceful civil coexistence,\u201d he said.",
      "Leo did refer explicitly to tensions in Venezuela, calling for a peaceful political solution that keeps in mind the \u201ccommon good of the peoples and not the defense of partisan interests.\u201d",
      "The U.S. military seized Maduro, the Venezuelan leader, in a surprise nighttime raid. The Trump administration is now seeking to control Venezuela\u2019s oil resources and its government. The U.S. government has insisted Maduro's capture was legal, saying drug cartels operating from Venezuela amounted to unlawful combatants and that the U.S. is now in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with them.",
      "Analysts and some world leaders have condemned the Venezuela mission, warning that Maduro\u2019s ouster could pave the way for more military interventions and a further erosion of the global legal order.",
      "On Ukraine, Leo repeated his appeal for an immediate ceasefire and urgently called for the international community \u201cnot to waver in its commitment to pursuing just and lasting solutions that will protect the most vulnerable and restore hope to the afflicted peoples.\u201d",

      "In other comments, Leo said the persecution of Christians around the world was \u201cone of the most widespread human rights crises today,\u201d affecting one in seven Christians globally.

      "He also described surrogacy as a threat to life and dignity. \u201cBy transforming gestation into a negotiable service, this violates the dignity both of the child, who is reduced to a product, and of the mother, exploiting her body and the generative process, and distorting the original relational calling of the family,\u201d he said.",

      "HONG KONG -- From 18th place to 140th. That's how much Hong Kong's ranking plunged in a global press freedom index over some 20 years.",
      "Behind the decline are the shutdown of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, more red lines for journalists and increasing self-censorship across the territory. The erosion of press freedom parallels a broader curtailment of the city's Western-style civil liberties since 2020, when Beijing imposed a national security law to eradicate challenges to its rule.",
      "Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai was convicted in December under the security law, facing up to life in prison. Hearings will begin on Monday for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "His trial has been watched closely by foreign governments and political observers as a barometer of media freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The government insists that his case has nothing to do with press freedom.",
      "Hong Kong's media environment was once freewheeling. Journalists often asked the government aggressive questions even as the owners of their outlets were pro-Beijing. News outlets regularly broke stories critical of politicians and officials.",
      "But the space for reporters has drastically narrowed after China imposed the security law, which it deemed necessary for stability after huge anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In 2020, Lai became one of the first prominent figures charged under the law. Within a year, authorities used the same law to arrest senior executives of Apple Daily. They raided its office and froze $2.3 million of its assets, effectively forcing the newspaper to shut down in June 2021.",
      "Online news site Stand News met a similar fate in December of that year, with arrests, police raids and asset freezes forcing its shutdown. By 2022, Hong Kong had plunged 68 places to 148th in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "In 2024, two Stand News editors became the first journalists since 1997 to be convicted of conspiracy to publish seditious articles under a separate, colonial-era law.",
      "In December, Lai was found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. Six Apple Daily executives charged in the same case had entered guilty pleas, admitting they conspired with Lai to request sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Francis Lee, a journalism and communication professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the Apple Daily and Stand News cases indicate that some common news practices of the past are no longer permitted. The Stand News case showed that some strongly critical commentaries with relatively intense expression might be considered seditious, he said. Lai's case involved allegations of calling for foreign sanctions.",
      "\u201cMaybe some advocacy journalism was at least permitted within the legal framework back then,\" he said, referring to before the security law was introduced. \u201cToday, it\u2019s no longer allowed.\u201d",
      "Self-censorship has become more prominent, but not only because of politics. Lee said mainstream news outlets face greater pressure not to upset their vital revenue streams, including advertisers and big companies, amid a difficult business environment.",
      "Many large companies in the city value the vast mainland Chinese market and ties with the government.",
      "Finding interviewees is not easy, either. \u201cIn Hong Kong nowadays, when some topics and perspectives cannot be reported, it's not just because of media outlets practicing self-censorship,\" Lee said. \u201cNo one is willing to speak. Self-censorship is a broad social phenomenon.\"",
      "Many opposition politicians and leading activists were jailed under the security law. Dozens of civil society groups closed down. Facing potential risks, some residents also became more reluctant to talk to reporters.",
      "Hong Kong Journalists Association chairperson Selina Cheng said many stories perceived to be politically sensitive or potentially questioning the authorities are not always easily published. There is an outsized concern over including responses from the government and pro-China groups to create balance, she said.",

The Office for Safeguarding National Security said some foreign media had spread false information and smeared the government\u2019s relief efforts after the fire and attacked the legislative election.",
      "After arrests of non-journalists who posted allegedly seditious content online or organized a petition, public voices grew quieter, leaving reporters with fewer interviewees, Lee said.",
      "A planned news conference related to the fire, organized by people including former pro-democracy district councilors, was canceled.

      "President Donald Trump says he wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates",
      "NEW YORK -- Reviving a campaign pledge, President Donald Trump wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, a move that could save Americans tens of billions of dollars but drew immediate opposition from an industry that has been in his corner.",
      "Trump was not clear in his social media post Friday night whether a cap might take effect through executive action or legislation, though one Republican senator said he had spoken with the president and would work on a bill with his \u201cfull support.\u201d Trump said he hoped it would be in place Jan. 20, one year after he took office.",
      "Strong opposition is certain from Wall Street in addition to the credit card companies, which donated heavily to his 2024 campaign and have supported Trump's second-term agenda. Banks are making the argument that such a plan would most hurt poor people, at a time of economic concern, by curtailing or eliminating credit lines, driving them to high-cost alternatives like payday loans or pawnshops.",
      "\u201cWe will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Researchers who studied Trump\u2019s campaign pledge after it was first announced found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back.",
      "About 195 million people in the United States had credit cards in 2024 and were assessed $160 billion in interest charges, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says. Americans are now carrying more credit card debt than ever, to the tune of about $1.23 trillion, according to figures from the New York Federal Reserve for the third quarter last year.",
      "Further, Americans are paying, on average, between 19.65% and 21.5% in interest on credit cards according to the Federal Reserve and other industry tracking sources. That has come down in the past year as the central bank lowered benchmark rates, but is near the highs since federal regulators started tracking credit card rates in the mid-1990s. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "The Republican administration has proved particularly friendly until now to the credit card industry.",
      "Capital One got little resistance from the White House when it finalized its purchase and merger with Discover Financial in early 2025, a deal that created the nation\u2019s largest credit card company. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is largely tasked with going after credit card companies for alleged wrongdoing, has been largely nonfunctional since Trump took office.",
      "In a joint statement, the banking industry was opposed to Trump's proposal.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the American Bankers Association and allied groups said.",
      "Bank lobbyists have long argued that lowering interest rates on their credit card products would require the banks to lend less to high-risk borrowers. When Congress enacted a cap on the fee that stores pay large banks when customers use a debit card, banks responded by removing all rewards and perks from those cards. Debit card rewards only recently have trickled back into consumers' hands. For example, United Airlines now has a debit card that gives miles with purchases.",
      "The U.S. already places interest rate caps on some financial products and for some demographics. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active-duty service members more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",

      "Credit card companies earn three streams of revenue from their products: fees charged to merchants, fees charged to customers and the interest charged on balances. The argument from some researchers and left-leaning policymakers is that the banks earn enough revenue from merchants to keep them profitable if interest rates were capped.",
      "\"A 10% credit card interest cap would save Americans $100 billion a year without causing massive account closures, as banks claim. That\u2019s because the few large banks that dominate the credit card market are making absolutely massive profits on customers at all income levels,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, who wrote the research on the industry's impact of Trump's proposal last year.",
      "There are some historic examples that interest rate caps do cut off the less creditworthy to financial products because banks are not able to price risk correctly. Arkansas has a strictly enforced interest rate cap of 17% and evidence points to the poor and less creditworthy being cut out of consumer credit markets in the state. Shearer's research showed that an interest rate cap of 10% would likely result in banks lending less to those with credit scores below 600.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how the president seeks to cap the rate or whether he has spoken with credit card companies about the idea.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who said he talked with Trump on Friday night, said the effort is meant to \u201clower costs for American families and to reign in greedy credit card companies who have been ripping off hardworking Americans for too long.\"",
      "Legislation in both the House and the Senate would do what Trump is seeking.",
      "Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., released a plan in February that would immediately cap interest rates at 10% for five years, hoping to use Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build momentum for their measure.",
      "Hours before Trump's post, Sanders said that the president, rather than working to cap interest rates, had taken steps to deregulate big banks that allowed them to charge much higher credit card fees.",
      "Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., have proposed similar legislation. Ocasio-Cortez is a frequent political target of Trump, while Luna is a close ally of the president.",

      "\u201cThis agreement is destined to boost our exports, with the goal of reaching 700 billion euros in exports,\" Tajani wrote in a post on X.

      "A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically is drawing to a close with no sign of improvements",
      "BEIJING -- A week in which longtime tensions between neighbors China and Japan ratcheted up economically and politically drew to a close with no sign of improvements Friday as the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo rebuffed his host nation and the Japanese reported delayed shipments to suppliers in China because of the spat.",
      "The two developments capped a week where China made clear its displeasure with Japan by instituting new export controls, condemning what it called Tokyo's renewed militarism and cozying up to another regional neighbor, South Korea, during its leader's visit to Beijing.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, kept the jabs coming.",
      "\u201cNew militarism will lead Japan back into the abyss,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cHistory serves as a stark warning, yet the Japanese right wing is repeating its old tricks.\u201d",
      "It was the latest in several days of pointed Chinese criticism toward Japan after its prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested in November that she wouldn't rule out intervening if China used military force against the island of Taiwan. China views self-governed Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has said it would take it by force if needed. It staged large-scale military exercises nearby late last month.",
      "On Thursday night, the Chinese embassy in Japan said it had rejected a petition from Japan's Foreign Ministry to retract the new export controls on \u201cdual-use items\u201d that the Japanese military might be able to use in weaponry. The ambassador, Wu Jianghao, insisted that China's move was \u201centirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful\u201d \u2014 and vital to national security.",
      "Also Friday, Japanese officials said they are closely watching if Japanese exports of agricultural, fisheries and other goods are appropriately handled by China without delays. The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that outgoing shipments of sake and processed food from Japan to China were being held up because of the diplomatic tensions, widening the ripples of the dispute.",
      "Officials at the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization told The Associated Press that the shipments had been delayed in customs on the China side starting in late November. Kyodo, quoting trade industry sources, said they believed sake may have been targeted as \u201ca symbol of Japan.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said he was aware of reports that some of the Japanese exports to China have been held up. He wouldn\u2019t comment on individual commercial transactions.",
      "\u201cIt is important that agricultural, fisheries and other exports from Japan are smoothly carried out,\u201d Kihara said. \u201cWe will closely watch the situation and take appropriate measures.\u201d He didn\u2019t say what those might be.",
      "Japan and China have a fraught history haunted by the Japanese colonization of Taiwan in 1895. The nations have fought two wars, and the imperial government in Tokyo brutally occupied parts of China in the first half of the 20th century. The countries maintain diplomatic relations and work closely together on many fronts but occasionally use government apparatus to condemn each other when disputes arise.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office has released new economic projections, expecting the Federal Reserve to cut short-term rates in 2026",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term rates in 2026, with its key interest rate settling at 3.4% towards the end of President Donald Trump 's term in office in 2028, according to a new report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Despite the Fed's cuts, however, the budget office projects the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to increase gradually, from 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2028. The 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates, so the forecast suggests mortgage borrowing could get more expensive over the next two years.",

      "Jobless rates are expected to increase before they improve over the next two years, the report states.",
      "The CBO expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.6% in 2026 but then ease to 4.4% in 2028 \u2014 affected largely by the impacts of Trump\u2019s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, as well as fewer migrants in the country.",
      "Also, the budget office projects that real gross domestic product growth is expected to rise to 2.2% in 2026, supported by the tax and spending law and a rebound from the late-2025 shutdown. GDP growth is then set to slow to an average of 1.8% in 2027 and 2028 as fiscal support wanes and labor force growth slows. The forecasts are similar to those made by the Federal Reserve, though the Fed expects growth will reach 2% in 2027 and 1.9% in 2028.",

      "Toilet paper, a product that is used for a few seconds before being disposed of forever, is typically made with trees, energy-intensive manufacturing processes and chemicals that can pollute the environment.",
      "Experts say more consumers are seeking toilet paper made from recycled content or sustainable materials, but it can be hard to know what to look for.",
      "Sustainable toilet paper often costs more, but can have significant environmental benefits. According to the Environmental Paper Network, a coalition of nonprofits, more than 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of water and 1.6 million trees could be saved if every American used one roll of toilet paper made from recycled content instead of a roll made from forest fibers.",
      "Here are some recommendations for buying sustainable toilet paper or reducing overall toilet paper use.",
      "North American toilet paper has traditionally been made from fibers from trees in Canada and eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Pulp made from the trees is bleached to create a bright white color, but the chlorine that's often used can hurt the environment. Large amounts of electricity and heat are used to remove moisture and form square sheets.",
      "Increasingly, manufacturers are making toilet paper from recycled paper products, which avoids material from freshly cut trees, and are using chlorine-free bleaching techniques. Once used, toilet paper itself is flushed and not recycled.",
      "Looking for recycled content is a good place for environmentally conscious consumers to start, said Gary Bull, professor emeritus of forest economics at the University of British Columbia. Preconsumer materials include scrap materials from manufacturing or unsold paper. Postconsumer materials come from paper products that have already been used.",
      "Making toilet paper from postconsumer recycled fibers improves its sustainability because paper is \u201cone of the easiest materials on the planet to recycle,\u201d Bull said.",
      "The best way for a scientist to evaluate the carbon footprint of an item is doing a life cycle assessment, which calculates the environmental impacts from when a tree is a seedling to when its fibers are converted into toilet paper and flushed down the drain, Bull said. But that method isn't within reach of consumers, so advocates have undertaken third-party assessments.",
      "Some companies add those labels to packaging to show that their processes have been vetted. Bull said labels on bath tissue from the Forest Stewardship Council or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative indicate the company is making scientifically-proven efforts to be sustainable. Both groups' standards include conserving water, wildlife, and biodiversity as well as compliance with applicable forestry laws to keep ecosystems healthy.",

Aria, Green Forest, Natural Value, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods 365 100% Recycled received the highest letter grade in 2025, with all made entirely from recycled materials.",

      "Mark Pitts, executive director of tissue at the American Forest & Paper Association, whose members include large toilet paper manufacturers such as Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Georgia-Pacific, told The Associated Press that sustainability is a core industry focus and members have reported reductions of greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain. He said that members follow responsible forestry practices and have increased their use of recycled material.",
      "Alternative materials such as fast-growing bamboo are often billed as more sustainable than toilet paper made from trees, but consumers should focus on toilet paper made with recycled materials instead, said Ronalds Gonzalez, an associate professor at North Carolina State University and expert on fibers used in the hygiene industry.",
      "Gonzalez said pollution from manufacturing processes can reduce the benefits of using bamboo. Gonzalez recently co-authored a study that found bamboo toilet paper made in China that is available in the U.S. had a higher environmental impact than toilet paper made in the U.S. with imported forest fibers, largely because Chinese manufacturers use electricity generated by coal. The study found the bamboo toilet paper\u2019s environmental impacts could be reduced when it was produced in regions that use renewable energy.",

      "Tebas said that in Spain alone, more than 35% of La Liga's content piracy continues to be distributed through Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure, despite thousands of formal notices and judicially backed enforcement measures implemented by Internet service providers.",
      "\"This is not a legal, technical or ideological debate, but a case of a company prioritizing its commercial interests and financial gain over the law, the sustainability of the global sports industry, and the protection of its own customers, whom it uses as a digital shield for organized piracy networks,\u201d Tebas said.",

      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",

However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Tonie Morgan scored 21 points to lead No. 6 Kentucky to a 63-57 win over fifth-ranked Oklahoma on Sunday.",
      "The Wildcats (15-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) rallied from a 13-point deficit in the second quarter for their second win over a top 10 opponent in two weeks. Kentucky opened conference play with an 80-78 win over 12th-ranked LSU on Jan. 1 in Baton Rouge. The Tigers were ranked No. 5 at the time.",
      "Clara Strack followed Morgan with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Strack had three of Kentucky eight blocks in the contest. Jordan Obi added 11 points for the Wildcats. Morgan, the SEC Player of the Week, has scored 50 points in the past three games for the Wildcats. She connected on a nifty four-point play after banking in a 3-pointer in the second quarter",
      "Coming off a 64-51 loss at Alabama, the Wildcats forced 18 turnovers and held the Sooners scoreless in the final four minutes and scored the final six points of the contest. Oklahoma built a 13-point lead at 24-11 with 7:17 remaining in the first half, but rallied and tied the score at 34-34 the half.",
      "The Wildcats were without senior Teonni Key, the team\u2019s third leading scorer (11 points per game). Key is recovering from an elbow injury she suffered in a 74-52 win over Missouri on Jan. 4.",
      "Aaliyah Chavez led Oklahoma (14-3, 2-2) with 18 points, followed by Raegan Beers with 14 and Payton Verhulst with 13. Beers was plagued by foul trouble and logged just 23 minutes and sat out most of the second half.",

      "It\u2019s hard to blame Jacksonville coach Liam Coen for relying on quarterback Trevor Lawrence against Buffalo",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- It\u2019s hard to blame Jacksonville coach Liam Coen for relying on quarterback Trevor Lawrence against Buffalo on Sunday.",
      "After all, Lawrence pretty much carried the Jaguars to the playoffs.",
      "But Lawrence looked little like the AFC player of the month for December and January in a 27-24 loss to the Bills that ended one of the franchise\u2019s most surprising seasons.",
      "Lawrence threw two interceptions, including one on the final possession, and turned the ball over on downs early in the second quarter when replays showed his shin touched the ground on a fourth-and-2 run deep in Buffalo territory.",
      "It was a significant momentum swing in the game. The Jaguars (13-5) could have gone up 14-3 and put pressure on Buffalo (13-5). Instead, they failed to score off a turnover and allowed Josh Allen to lead a 92-yard TD drive.",
      "\u201cI wish we played cleaner in certain areas,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI wish I had made one or two decisions a little bit differently, threw a better ball here or there. You\u2019ve got to live with it. It\u2019s life. You don\u2019t get do-overs. It\u2019s a bummer.",
      "\u201cBut I know that we left everything out there. I know I put everything into this this year. It\u2019s sucks that we don\u2019t get to keep playing. This is a special group.\u201d",
      "Lawrence completed 18 of 30 passes for 207 yards, with three touchdowns to go along with the turnovers. He also ran six times for 31 yards. He was late on several passes and rarely looked crisp, especially early. He found a rhythm in the fourth quarter and put Jacksonville ahead twice.",
      "He became the third quarterback in NFL history to deliver multiple go-ahead TD passes in the fourth quarter of a playoff loss, joining Allen (at Kansas City in 2021) and New Orleans\u2019 Drew Brees (at San Francisco in 2011), according to ESPN Research.",
      "He connected with Parker Washington and Travis Etienne for scores in final frame, putting the Jags up 17-13 and 24-20. But Allen kept carrying the Bills back into the lead \u2014 and ultimately the win.",
      "Coen surely will get questioned for leaning on Lawrence instead of running backs Travis Etienne and Bhayshul Tuten. The duo combined for 118 yards on 15 carries, averaging nearly 8 yards a run against one of the NFL\u2019s most porous run defenses.",

      "\u201cJust called the game like I always call the game,\u201d Coen said.",
      "It was an obviously disappointing ending for Jacksonville, which won its most games since 1999 and built a foundation of success in Coen\u2019s debut season. Lawrence was a big reason for it. He accounted for 25 touchdowns in the team\u2019s eight-game winning streak in which it averaged 33.6 points.",
      "He also played fairly cleanly in those games, with just four turnovers. But it ended against the Bills.",
      "\u201cIn any playoff game, mistakes are always magnified,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt always comes down to the end. You don\u2019t see a lot of blowouts in the playoffs. Everything\u2019s on the line, and everyone\u2019s fighting.",
      "\u201cSo whether it\u2019s turnovers or turnovers on downs \u2013 we had three of those today, total \u2013 those add up and take points of the board. \u2026 I got to be better, cleaner there.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- Back in late October, the Colorado Avalanche fell to Carolina at home in a shootout.",
      "They haven't lost in their own building since, reeling off 17 straight wins. The Avalanche are a home win away from matching the team record set by the 2021-22 Stanley Cup-winning squad.",
      "Maybe it's the benefits of playing at elevation \u2014 a lung-searing 5,280 feet (1,609 meters) above sea level. Maybe it's the crowd noise. Or maybe, as defenseman Cale Makar believes, the secret behind their home success boils down to something more simple: \"Not talking about it,\u201d he said with a chuckle.",
      "Colorado, 2-0 on its seven-game homestand, currently has the sixth-longest home win streak in NHL history. The record is 23 in a row by the 2011-12 Detroit Red Wings.",
      "On top of all that, the Avalanche (19-0-2) have yet to lose at Ball Arena in regulation. Their 21-game home point streak is second in team history to the 2021-22 squad (22 games).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re a stingy team at home,\u201d said Makar, whose team has a chance to tie the franchise mark Monday night against Toronto. \"Teams have got to know when they come in here they\u2019re going to get our best effort and it\u2019s going to be a tough challenge for them.\u201d",
      "Playing at a higher elevation can be draining for an opponent. Especially a team coming in on the second night of a back-to-back like, say, Ottawa did last Thursday. The speedy Avalanche pushed the pace and raced to an 8-2 victory over the Senators.",
      "Colorado can also grind it out, too. That's what the team did against Columbus on Saturday when its top line, led by Nathan MacKinnon, was kept off the scoresheet. Brent Burns, the 40-year-old defenseman who is chasing his first Stanley Cup title, stepped up with two goals. Also playing a big role was backup goaltender Trent Miner, who stopped 29 shots in the 4-0 win over the Blue Jackets. It was not only Miner's first NHL shutout but his inaugural win.",
      "\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re always fired up to play at home,\u201d said Blue Jackets forward Charlie Coyle, who finished last season with Colorado after being acquired at the trade deadline. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get their good game. It\u2019s not going to be a back-and-forth or anything like that. They play well. They play consistent.\u201d",
      "The building is always loud, too. The Avalanche have sold out 174 straight home games, including the postseason.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable here,\u201d said defenseman Josh Manson, who had a Gordie Howe hat trick with two goals, two assists and a fight against Ottawa. \"We can get the momentum behind us and when we get the momentum behind us, with the fans and such, it really helps.

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",

      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",

      "But for other families, confidence about vaccines is waning as trust in science erodes. O'Shea lamented that parents are getting the message that they can't trust medical experts.",

In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that it knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers.",
      "The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Health tech gadgets displayed at the annual CES trade show make a lot of promises. A smart scale promoted a healthier lifestyle by scanning your feet to track your heart health, and an egg-shaped hormone tracker uses AI to help you figure out the best time to conceive.",
      "Tech and health experts, however, question the accuracy of products like these and warn of data privacy issues \u2014 especially as the federal government eases up on regulation.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced during the show in Las Vegas that it will relax regulations on \u201clow-risk\u201d general wellness products such as heart monitors and wheelchairs. It's the latest step President Donald Trump's administration has taken to remove barriers for AI innovation and use. The White House repealed former President Joe Biden's executive order establishing guardrails around AI, and last month, the Department of Health and Human Services outlined its strategy to expand its use of AI.",
      "Booths at the conference showcased new tech designed to help people living in rural areas with their health care needs amid doctor shortages, boost research into women\u2019s health and make life easier for people with disabilities.",
      "AI technologies have benefits in the over $4.3 trillion health care industry, according to Marschall Runge, professor of medical science at the University of Michigan. They\u2019re good at analyzing medical imaging and can help streamline doctors\u2019 busy schedules, but they can also promote biases and \u201challucinate,\u201d providing incorrect information stated as fact.",
      "\u201cI would urge people not to think that the technology is the same as a well-resourced, thoughtful, research-driven medical professional,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "Privacy protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act do not cover information collected by consumer devices, and the companies could be using the data to train their AI mode ls, or selling it to other businesses, Cohn said.",
      "With a lot of the gadgets at CES, it\u2019s difficult to find out where your information is going, Cohn said.",

      "Sylvia Kang, founder and CEO of Mira, said she created the egg-shaped hormone tracker because many of her friends were trying to conceive and realized they had no knowledge of their hormonal health. To use the \u201cworld\u2019s mini hormone lab,\u201d you dip a wand in urine, insert the wand into the monitor and look at the results on the app.",

      "Many gadgets at CES focused on women\u2019s health, which has been historically under-researched and underfunded. Before 1993, women were excluded from clinical trials, and there still is little research on areas like menopause.",
      "While not every woman will have a baby, all women go through menopause, and \u201cyet we know nothing about it,\u201d said Amy Divaraniya, founder and CEO of the women\u2019s health company Oova, during a session.",

      "Other products at CES were promoted as a way to increase accessibility to health information. The free medicine-focused AI chatbot called 0xmd helps improve access to medical information in areas with doctor shortages and provides a cost-effective alternative, said its founder and architect Allen Au. People can ask the chatbot questions about medicine, upload photos of a mole or rash, and submit their doctors\u2019 notes for an easier-to-understand translation, Au said.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.",
      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.",
      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is under fire for generating sexualized images of women and children without consent",
      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",
      "The European Union's executive arm has denounced Grok while officials and regulators in France, India, Malaysia and Brazil have condemned the platform and called for investigations.",
      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",
      "Kendall said the content is \u201cabsolutely appalling, and unacceptable in decent society.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls.\"",
      "Ofcom said Monday it has made \u201curgent contact\u201d with X.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "The watchdog said it contacted both X and xAI to understand what steps it has taken to comply with British regulations.",
      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",
      "A Polish lawmaker used Grok on Tuesday as a reason for national digital safety legislation that would beef up protections for minors and make it easier for authorities to remove content.",

      "The Indian government on Friday issued an ultimatum to X, demanding that it take down all \u201cunlawful content\" and take action against offending users. The country's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also ordered the company to review Grok's \"technical and governance framework\" and file a report on actions taken.",
      "The ministry accused Grok of \u201cgross misuse\u201d of AI and serious failures of its safeguards and enforcement by allowing the generation and sharing of \u201dobscene images or videos of women in derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them.\"",
      "The ministry warned failure to comply by the 72-hour deadline would expose the company to bigger legal problems, but the deadline passed with no public update from India.",
      "The Malaysian communications watchdog said Saturday it was investigating X users who violated laws prohibiting spreading \u201cgrossly offensive, obscene or indecent content.\u201d",
      "The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said it's also investigating online harms on X, and would summon a company representative.",
      "The watchdog said it took note of public complaints about X's AI tools being used to digitally manipulate \u201cimages of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.\u201d",
      "Lawmaker Erika Hilton said she reported Grok and X to the Brazilian federal public prosecutor\u2019s office and the country's data protection watchdog.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",
      "Whatever the reason, the T1's ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn't come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.",
      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "Authorities in the city of Catania have suspended or restricted excursions to see the volcano's lava flows, prompting guides to go on strike for the first time in decades and leaving disgruntled tourists with fewer options to see the spectacle up close.",
      "Dozens of the guides demonstrated Wednesday in front of Mount Etna\u2019s lava flow gate, calling the new restrictions excessive and saying the lava flows are slow-moving enough to be viewed safely as has been done in the past.",
      "\u201cThese measures effectively nullify the role of guides, stripping them of their skills, function, and professional responsibility,\u201d a statement by the guides\u2019 regional board said.",
      "The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow. Also, a previously existing limit of 10 people per group is being vigorously enforced, including with drones.",
      "Mount Etna is Europe\u2019s most active volcano and the continent\u2019s largest. It attracts hikers and backpackers to its slopes, while less adventurous tourists can take it in from a distance, most stunningly from the Ionian Sea.",

      "Becky Pepper-Jackson is a 15-year-old in West Virginia who knows the upcoming sports season could be her last",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Becky Pepper-Jackson finished third in the discus throw in West Virginia last year though she was in just her first year of high school. Now a 15-year-old sophomore, Pepper-Jackson is aware that her upcoming season could be her last.",
      "West Virginia has banned transgender girls like Pepper-Jackson from competing in girls and women's sports, and is among the more than two dozen states with similar laws. Though the West Virginia law has been blocked by lower courts, the outcome could be different at the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, which has allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced in the past year.",
      "The justices are hearing arguments Tuesday in two cases over whether the sports bans violate the Constitution or the landmark federal law known as Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in education. The second case comes from Idaho, where college student Lindsay Hecox challenged that state's law.",
      "Decisions are expected by early summer.",

I know it\u2019s important to other people. So, like, I\u2019m here for it.\u201d",

      "Pepper-Jackson has grown into a competitive discus and shot put thrower. In addition to the bronze medal in the discus, she finished eighth among shot putters.",
      "She attributes her success to hard work, practicing at school and in her backyard, and lifting weights. Pepper-Jackson has been taking puberty-blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since she was in the third grade, though the Supreme Court's decision in June upholding state bans on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors has forced her to go out of state for care.",
      "Her very improvement as an athlete has been cited as a reason she should not be allowed to compete against girls.",
      "\u201cThere are immutable physical and biological characteristic differences between men and women that make men bigger, stronger, and faster than women. And if we allow biological males to play sports against biological females, those differences will erode the ability and the places for women in these sports which we have fought so hard for over the last 50 years,\u201d West Virginia's attorney general, JB McCuskey, said in an AP interview. McCuskey said he is not aware of any other transgender athlete in the state who has competed or is trying to compete in girls or women\u2019s sports.",
      "Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women's sports after Trump signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.",
      "The public generally is supportive of the limits. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion.",
      "About 2.1 million adults, or 0.8%, and 724,000 people age 13 to 17, or 3.3%, identify as transgender in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.",

      "Greenland\u2019s harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have prevented anyone from building a mine to extract the sought-after rare earth elements that many high-tech products require",
      "Greenland's harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have so far prevented anyone from building a mine to extract the sought-after rare earth elements that many high-tech products require. Even if President Donald Trump prevails in his effort to take control of the arctic island, those challenges won't go away.",
      "Trump has prioritized breaking China's stranglehold on the global supply of rare earths ever since the world's number two economy sharply restricted who could buy them after the United States imposed widespread tariffs last spring. The Trump administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars and even taken stakes in several companies. Now the president is again pitching the idea that wresting control of Greenland away from Denmark could solve the problem.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\u201d Trump said Friday.",
      "But Greenland may not be able to produce rare earths for years \u2014 if ever. Some companies are trying anyway, but their efforts to unearth some of the 1.5 million tons of rare earths encased in rock in Greenland generally haven't advanced beyond the exploratory stage. Trump's fascination with the island nation may be more about countering Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic than securing any of the hard-to-pronounce elements like neodymium and terbium that are used to produce the high-powered magnets needed in electric vehicles, wind turbines, robots and fighter jets among other products.",
      "\u201cThe fixation on Greenland has always been more about geopolitical posturing \u2014 a military-strategic interest and stock-promotion narrative \u2014 than a realistic supply solution for the tech sector,\u201d said Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director of the Critical Minerals Institute. \u201cThe hype far outstrips the hard science and economics behind these critical minerals.\"",
      "Trump confirmed those geopolitical concerns at the White House Friday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want Russia or China going to Greenland, which if we don\u2019t take Greenland, you can have Russia or China as your next door neighbor. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump said",
      "The main challenge to mine in Greenland is, \u201cof course, the remoteness. Even in the south where it\u2019s populated, there are few roads and no railways, so any mining venture would have to create these accessibilities,\u201d said Diogo Rosa, an economic geology researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Power would also have to be generated locally, and expert manpower would have to be brought in.",
      "Another concern is the prospect of mining rare earths in the fragile Arctic environment just as Greenland tries to build a thriving tourism industry, said Patrick Schr\u00f6der, a senior fellow in the Environment and Society program at the Chatham House think-tank in London.",
      "\u201cToxic chemicals needed to separate the minerals out from the rock, so that can be highly polluting and further downstream as well, the processing,\" Shr\u00f6der said. Plus, rare earths are often found alongside radioactive uranium.",
      "Besides the unforgiving climate that encases much of Greenland under layers of ice and freezes the northern fjords for much of the year, the rare earths found there tend to be encased in a complex type of rock called eudialyte, and no one has ever developed a profitable process to extract rare earths from that type of rock. Elsewhere, these elements are normally found in different rock formation called carbonatites, and there are proven methods to work with that.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re in a race for resources \u2014 for critical minerals \u2014 then we should be focusing on the resources that are most easily able to get to market,\" said David Abraham, a rare earths expert who has followed the industry for decades and wrote the book \u201cThe Elements of Power.\u201d",

But that company and more than a dozen others exploring deposits on the island remain far away from actually building a mine and would still need to raise at least hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "Even the most promising projects can struggle to turn a profit, particularly when China resorts to dumping extra materials onto the market to depress prices and drive competitors out of business as it has done many times in the past. And currently most critical minerals have to be processed in China.",
      "The U.S. is scrambling to expand the supply of rare earths outside of China during the one-year reprieve from even tougher restrictions that Trump said Xi Jinping agreed to in October. A number of companies around the world are already producing rare earths or magnets and can deliver more quickly than anything in Greenland, which Trump has threatened to seize with military power if Denmark doesn't agree to sell it.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s just been running to get to this endpoint. And if you go to Greenland, it\u2019s like you\u2019re going back to the beginning,\u201d said Ian Lange, an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines.",
      "Many in the industry, too, think America should focus on helping proven companies instead of trying to build new rare earth mines in Greenland, Ukraine, Africa or elsewhere. A number of other mining projects in the U.S. and friendly nations like Australia are farther along and in much more accessible locations.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Daniel Walker Howe has died at 88",
      "NEW YORK -- Daniel Walker Howe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d became a widely acclaimed chronicle of the vast technological and social changes in the U.S. in the first half of the 19th century, has died at age 88.",
      "Walker died on Dec. 25, according to a spokesman for the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a professor emeritus. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "Awarded the Pulitzer in 2008, \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was part of the Oxford University Press' ambitious and decades-long series on American history, with other works including such Pulitzer winners as David M. Kennedy's book on the Great Depression and World War II, \u201cFreedom from Fear,\u201d and James M. McPherson's Civil War epic \u201cThe Battle Cry of Freedom.\u201d",
      "Howe's 900-page book covered 1815-1848, from the end of the War of 1812 to the dawn of organized feminism in the U.S. \u2014 the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848. Howe traced the steady expansion west of a young country abiding by the doctrine of \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d He documented the rise of Andrew Jackson and modern political parties, the overturning of the elite order that had controlled the presidency since George Washington, and the ongoing debate over slavery that would lead to armed conflict.",
      "The country was facing changes familiar to 21st century Americans. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the U.S. became more industrialized, more entwined and more divided. Information was traveling faster; the title \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was taken from the biblical phrase used for the first telegraph message, sent in 1844. Newspapers and books were proliferating thanks to cheaper printing and to more efficient mail service, and the infrastructure was being modernized through roads, bridges, canals and other public works projects.",
      "At the same time, the more technology advanced, the more resistance arose in the South, where leading politicians opposed the new projects \u2014 \"internal improvements\u201d \u2014 for fear they would undermine slavery.",
      "\u201cInternal improvements could be opposed for reasons that had nothing to do with their economic effects. There were those who felt their stake in the status quo threatened by any innovation, especially intervention sponsored by the federal government,\u201d Howe wrote.",
      "Reviewing the book for The New Yorker in 2007, historian Jill Lepore praised it as \u201ca heroic attempt at synthesizing a century and a half of historical writing.\u201d She also noted that \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was not the first choice for Oxford editor C. Vann Woodward, the prize-winning Southern historian.",
      "\u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was, in part, a response to another acclaimed work: Charles Sellers\u2019 landmark \u201cThe Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846.\u201d Woodward had asked Sellers to contribute to the Oxford series but turned down \u201cThe Market Revolution\u201d because he found it too negative. Released by Oxford as a separate volume in 1991, Sellers\u2019 book contended that advances in technology uprooted rural communities and livelihoods and portrayed Jackson as an opposing force who stood \u2014 in vain \u2014 for working people against the industrial powers.",

      "Howe had studied under Sellers at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s, but he formed a different view of the country\u2019s past. He found that innovation served less as a destroyer of old ties than as a force for democracy. He dedicated \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d to the patrician John Quincy Adams, Jackson\u2019s bitter rival in presidential elections and his opposite in personal background.",
      "\u201cBefore I wrote this book I had never really grasped how often improvements in material terms fostered improvements in moral terms,\" Howe told the National Review in 2007. \u201cThe people who encouraged economic diversification and development in many cases also supported more humane laws, wider access to education, a halt to the expansion of slavery, even, sometimes, greater equality for women.\u201d",
      "Howe's other books included \u201cThe Unitarian Conscience: Harvard Moral Philosophy 1805-1861,\u201d \u201cThe Political Culture of the American Whigs\u201d and \u201cMaking the American Self: Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln.\u201d He taught at several schools, starting with Yale University in 1966 and continuing at UCLA from 1973-93 and Oxford University from 1993-2002. He married Sandra Fay Shumway in 1961 and had three children: Christopher, Rebecca and Stephen.",
      "Born in Ogden, Utah, and raised in Denver, he recalled loving history since age 6 when his father told him about \"Hannibal crossing the Alps with elephants to fight the Romans,\u201d as he told The Harvard Crimson in 2009. He majored in history and literature at Harvard University and received his doctorate in history from Berkeley in 1966.",
      "Howe has said that being asked to write \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d appealed to him for the chance to write for general readers, and not just historians. His intention was to craft an old-fashioned narrative while drawing upon more recent scholarship on social movements, presenting the country's history as an ongoing debate over whether success was defined by military and economic power or by moral achievements.",
      "\u201cIn 1848, it seemed that the greatness of the American people had been shown in their extensive recent conquest across the continent. Later, that greatness could seem affirmed by the preservation of the Union, industrial might, commercial influence, scientific research, and victories over global enemies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cLater still, perhaps that greatness might be seen in the extent to which the dreams of the 1848 feminists and abolitionists have at length been realized. History works on a long time scale, and at any given moment we can perceive directions but imperfectly.\u201d",

      "Prisoners are now taking regular trips to far-flung, exotic locales such as Thailand",
      "CHOWCHILLA, Calif. -- Jacob Smith has been in prison for two decades but he and other inmates are still taking regular trips to far-flung, exotic locales. No passport required, just a virtual reality headset.",
      "\u201cI went to Thailand, man!\u201d Smith recalled with a grin, describing the first time he strapped on a VR device and was transported to the lush landscapes and bustling markets of Southeast Asia.",
      "A Los Angeles-based nonprofit is bringing the technology to California prisons with the goal of providing inmates a brief escape and, more importantly, exposure to real world scenarios that will prepare them to reenter society.",
      "During a weeklong program last month, incarcerated men at Valley State Prison near Fresno sat on metal folding chairs in a common area. They shuffled in their seats as they were outfitted with the headsets that resemble opaque goggles. Their necks contorted slightly and smiles spread across their faces as the high-definition videos started and their journeys commenced.",
      "Some saw the sights on the other side of the globe, including Bangkok, while others experienced more practical scenes, such as job interviews. The men sit across virtual desks from virtual interviewers who are both easygoing and hard-nosed to give them the tools for finding employment once they're released.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of us, the workforce has changed and things are different with the application process,\u201d said Smith, who is eligible for parole in 2031 and now volunteers helping his fellow inmates navigate the VR experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a nerve wracking experience going to sit in front of somebody and telling them why I\u2019m good for the job.\u201d",
      "Afterward, volunteers help the inmates process the emotions or traumas that bubbled up during their experiences. Sabra Williams, founder of the nonprofit Creative Acts, calls the VR devices a \u201chope machine.\u201d",
      "The program stems from a prison arts project that Williams ran that incorporated theater, music, poetry, dance and painting. Watching incarcerated people become engaged in artistic pursuits made her wonder about other ways to \u201cbring the outside world inside.\"",
      "She heard from people who had left prison lamenting that technology had passed them by. They felt confounded by simple things like pumping gas, checking out at a supermarket, or going to the ATM.",
      "\u201cAnd what I hear from them is that it made them feel like they didn\u2019t belong, and that they only belong in prison,\u201d she said.",
      "First Williams' group dug for footage on YouTube to recreate everyday activities. Soon they were creating their own videos focusing on travel, constructive scenarios, civic engagement, conflict resolution, art, and even meditation \u201cto blow their minds and also educate their minds.\u201d",
      "Such technology could have an important role to play in rehabilitation and, especially, reintegration into society, said Nancy La Vigne, the dean of Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice in New Jersey. She envisions people who haven't been in the real world for a long time using VR to act out navigating the DMV or figuring out how to take a city bus.",

      "Another benefit could be a calming effect on stressed out inmates. La Vigne points to research published by the American Psychological Association that found that incarcerated people who viewed short nature videos showed reduced levels of aggression and were subject to fewer discipline reports.",
      "But with a hefty price tag and limited access, La Vigne worries about the \u201cpractical realities,\" such as unintended consequences that stem from those who might be left out of the VR experience.",
      "\u201cYou can't just hand them out or sell them at commissary,\u201d La Vigne said.",
      "A former inmate, Richard Richard, first used a VR headset about six years ago when the program was launched and since his release has become a volunteer for Creative Acts. He said he's impressed by how far the technology has advanced. He loves watching his fellow inmates use the devices for the first time and then progress as they deal with trauma and emotional issues.",
      "\u201cYou may physically be here, but mentally, spiritually you can actually transcend this environment,\u201d he said.",
      "The group conducts the program, using 100 Oculus headsets donated by Meta, both in general population and in solitary confinement. Youth offenders are also eligible. It currently runs three times a year at four California prisons, and Williams hopes to expand it throughout the state and across the country.",
      "The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation didn't immediately respond this week to inquiries about plans to expand the program. But in announcing the introduction of VR at the California Men's Colony prison in San Luis Obispo County last August, the department said the usage has the potential \u201cto heal trauma, regulate emotional response, and prepare for a safe, successful reentry into society.\u201d",
      "The introductory two-minute trip to Thailand is often emotional for many inmates, some of whom had \u201cnever been off their block, let alone out the country,\u201d Williams said.",
      "\u201cAnd so many times people would take off the headsets and they\u2019d be crying,\" she said. \"Because they\u2019d be like, \u2018I never knew the world was so beautiful.\u2019\u201d",

      "Trump and his officials have indicated they want to control Greenland to enhance American security and explore business and mining deals. But Imran Bayoumi, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, said the sudden focus on Greenland is also the result of decades of neglect by several U.S. presidents towards Washington's position in the Arctic.",
      "The current fixation is partly down to \u201cthe realization we need to increase our presence in the Arctic, and we don\u2019t yet have the right strategy or vision to do so,\u201d he said.",

      "While there are probably Russian submarines \u2014 as there are across the Arctic region \u2014 there are no surface vessels, Mortensgaard said.

Danish media reported that at least three people with connections to Trump carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.",
      "Even if the U.S. managed to take control of Greenland, it would likely come with a large bill, Gad said. That\u2019s because Greenlanders currently have Danish citizenship and access to the Danish welfare system, including free health care and schooling.",

      "U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News on Thursday that Denmark has neglected its missile defense obligations in Greenland, but Mortensgaard said that it makes \u201clittle sense to criticize Denmark,\u201d because the main reason why the U.S. operates the Pituffik base in the north of the island is to provide early detection of missiles.",

      "State Attorney General Letitia James said in legal challenges filed in federal court in Washington that the U.S. Department of the Interior's Dec. 22 order suspending construction on the projects off Long Island, citing national security concerns, was arbitrary and unwarranted.",
      "The Democrat said Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind projects had already cleared more than a decade of security and safety reviews by federal, state and local authorities. She said pausing them now threatens New York\u2019s economy and energy grid, and she asked the court to intervene.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers deserve clean, reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a government that follows the law,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cThis reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk.\u201d",

      "The Interior Department's order last month suspended Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and three other offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast. The department maintains that the movement of massive turbine blades can cause radar interference called \u201cclutter\" that can obscure legitimate moving targets and generate false ones.",

      "\u201cWe hope that these values will help young people in our city grow,\u201d he said.",
      "The first step in shaping the Ora Sport on Fire Tour was studying the Olympic Charter, the founding document of the Olympic movement.",

It's considered the country\u2019s largest abandoned burial ground, according to Friends of Mount Moriah Cemetery, which helps maintain the 160-acre landmark in Yeadon that's home to an estimated 150,000 grave sites.",

Police say the break-ins centered on sealed vaults and mausoleums containing older burials, which had been smashed open or had stonework damaged to reach the remains inside.",

    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:52:27 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

    "story": [
      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

Pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder. Print that! Print that!\"",
      "Nick Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, accused of\u00a0stabbing his parents to death\u00a0on Dec. 14 in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

      "Jackson, who famously won an acquittal in the murder trial of Karen Read and represented disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not explain his decision to withdraw from the case. Outside the courthouse, he told CBS News it was one of the most painful decisions he's ever made as a lawyer.",
      "Jackson said he was forced to withdraw due to \"circumstances beyond our control, but more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick's control,\" which \"have dictated that, sadly, it's impossible for us to continue our representation.\" He added that he was \"legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"",
      "The L.A. County Public Defender's Office will take over for Jackson and his co-counsel.

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",

    "summary": "The innovative pioneer of modern dance is a Kennedy Center Honoree who has been shattering barriers all her life",
    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "\"I'm not political,\" she said. \"I have my own way of being political. That's the first time I've ever felt that I ... I just can't.\"",
      "Braver said, \"Some people would say, 'Well, even so, he's our president, and it's just fitting to go.'\"",
      "To which de Lavallade responded, \"I am 86 now. I have all these years, I have done what anybody asked me to, and this is the first time in my life I've ever said no. And I think at this time, it's my privilege.\"",
      "But Carmen de Lavallade will be there at tonight's Kennedy Center gala savoring her award for a life well-danced:",
      "\"I'm glad to think that whatever I did meant something, that really meant something,\" she said. \"That's what I'm pleased about.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 21:42:12 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

    "summary": "The White House said it will review its protocols for releasing economic data after President Trump's \"inadvertent public disclosure.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",
      "Mr. Trump's data provided only a partial snapshot of the December labor market, while most investors are looking for the overall monthly data, including the most recent unemployment rate, he added.",
      "\"For people who are kind of really trying to get a sense of the economy, they want to look at the full release,\" Crisafulli said.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",
      "\"The political situation in Venezuela is really uncertain right now. Before a company is going to realistically invest a lot of money, they will want a stable political situation,\" she added.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

The strategy will rely on major investment from American energy companies to revitalize Venezuela's dilapidated oil infrastructure. The president has said he wants U.S. companies to invest $100 billion toward the effort.At the public portion of Friday's meeting, Mr. Trump pressed the assembled executives to act quickly to tap into the \"tremendous wealth\" in the country.

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:39:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The monthly job gains were slightly below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 50,000 jobs in December, capping a year of muted job growth that saw employers pull back on hiring amid economic uncertainty.",
      "The numbers",
      "The monthly job gains were below the 55,000 forecast by economists, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.",
      "Payroll gains were revised downward for both October and November, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously reported in those months. The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",
      "In December, hiring was robust in food services and drinking, health care and social assistance, while the retail sector shed jobs, the BLS said.",
      "Most layoffs since 2020",
      "Employers announced 1.2 million job cuts in 2025, a 58% increase from the prior year and the highest level since 2020, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said Thursday.",
      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",
      "What it means",
      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",
      "Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email note that she expects a pause for now, but two cuts at some point this year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

      "Paramount Skydance later returned with an improved offer that included a personal guarantee from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison \u2014 the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison \u2014 for $40.4 billion in equity financing.",
      "But on Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",
      "On Thursday, January 8, Paramount Skydance said it is sticking with its current offer, reiterating the company's belief that the bid is \"superior to WBD's existing agreement with Netflix.\"",
      "\"Our offer clearly provides WBD investors greater value and a more certain, expedited path to completion,\" David Ellison said in a statement. \"Throughout this process, we have worked hard for WBD shareholders and remain committed to engaging with them on the merits of our superior bid and advancing our ongoing regulatory review process.\"",
      "Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomed\" Warner Bros. Discovery's ongoing commitment to the companies' merger. The streaming service added that it has submitted its Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with U.S. agencies, which is required for a review of potential antitrust issues.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO network, as well as its streaming and studios business, for $27.75 a share. Under the deal, Warner's cable division would be spun off into a separately run unit before the merger is completed.",
      "Netflix's bid includes $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock representing a target value of $4.50. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 a share to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery, valuing the offer at roughly $108 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

      "The change could prove a stumbling block for people who need to ensure that mail such as bill payments, taxes or voting ballots are postmarked by specific dates. For instance, state and federal quarterly estimated taxes typically must be postmarked by January 15, April 15, June 15 and September 15 to avoid late fees.",
      "The change is part of the postal agency's 10-year plan to reduce costs and restore profitability. USPS' loss narrowed slightly in its most recent fiscal year, shrinking from $9.5 billion in 2024 to\u00a0$9 billion last year, but it continues to struggle with high costs and dwindling mail volumes.",

      "People who want to ensure their mail is postmarked with a specific date should ask USPS clerks at a branch counter to manually place a postmark on the letter or package, a USPS spokeswoman told CBS News.",

This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",

      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

    "summary": "Eligible Amazon customers can now request a refund from a settlement over allegations of deceptive Prime enrollment practices.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "What information do you need to file a claim?",
      "The settlement site says you'll need to provide the requested information, which includes a claim ID and PIN provided in the email or mailing sent to customers. You'll also have to sign and submit the claim before July 21.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",
      "How will the Amazon Prime refunds be issued?",
      "The refunds will be sent through PayPal, Venmo or mailed checks, according to the settlement site. People who file claims can specify their preferred payment method.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",

      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",

    "summary": "A prediction market user won big after wagering $32,000 that the U.S. would capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Was it insider trading?",
    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:36:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is counting on U.S. oil companies to revive Venezuela's creaky energy production and tap its massive reserves.",
    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

    "summary": "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Jerome Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to the Fed chair.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Friday received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department stemming from a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell, he said in a video statement on Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to Powell.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH",
      "The project and Powell's testimony last year came under scrutiny of the Trump administration, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "In his testimony to the Senate, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens, disputing claims made by Vought.",
      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said Attorney General Pam Bondi \"has instructed her U.S. Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars,\" but did not refer to any specific case.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed him\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "For months last year, Mr. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the Fed's decision to leave interest rates stable. The president\u00a0argued\u00a0that inflation was already low enough to start cutting rates. It wasn't until late 2025 that the Fed started cutting rates.",
      "The president has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, including as recently as last month.",
      "Closing out his statement Sunday, Powell said, \"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment ... I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department has a playbook ready for responding to emergencies like the one unfolding in Minneapolis, including containing unrest and defusing community anger or distrust in law enforcement.",
      "In the civil rights era, the agency formed its Community Relations Service, a group of dozens of federal specialists who were informally referred to as \"America's peacemaker.\"",
      "For the type of crisis emerging in Minneapolis, the Community Relations Service had a long-time, fulltime staffer based in Minnesota, and would also immediately deploy its specialists from Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Indianapolis and Madison to get on the ground promptly to assist.",
      "At a time when relations between federal agents and the Minneapolis community, Portland and other U.S. cities have been deteriorating, the Justice Department is being criticized for scrapping its playbook, and turning away its \"peacemakers.\"",
      "Several sources, including current and former Justice Department employees, said the Trump administration has shuttered the office and has begun pushing out many of the approximately 60 employees who served in the Community Relations Service.",
      "In a June 2025 report, the Trump administration said, \"The (community relations service) mission does not comport with Attorney General and Administration law enforcement and litigating priorities.\"",
      "An agency budget request for 2026 showed the Justice Department planned to reduce the office's staffing from 56 to zero. The Justice Department estimates the cuts would save $24 million this year.",
      "Julius Nam, a former Justice Department prosecutor and Community Relations Service specialist told CBS News the office\"has had a neutral, impartial role. That is so important in these situations, in which there is deep distrust of law enforcement by protesters and community groups.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service, whose specialists are referred to as \"conciliators,\" convenes forums, meetings and dialogues to ease tensions and help head off unrest, protests and hate crimes.",
      "In a span from 2021 through 2024, the office conducted more than a dozen formal mediation sessions and more than 100 training programs.",
      "In Minneapolis, the office had some recent successes, in its response to the killing of George Floyd in 2020. An agency report reviewed by CBS News said the Community Relations Service's deployment to Minneapolis during the trial of Floyd's killer was the largest by the office in 2021.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service deployed twice to Minneapolis during the trial and sentencing of Derek Chauvin,\" the report said. \"Despite the challenges of social distancing, CRS conciliators worked for months to build relationships with the community, facilitate dialogues, and lead trainings.\"",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who used to work in the Community Relations Service, told CBS News, \"When we sideline peacemakers, we all pay the price.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is not the first and not the last city where you'd want peacemakers on the streets.\"",
      "Brandenburg said that through its 60-year history, the office was effective in\u00a0 its work to ensure independence and trust among police, local government leaders and communities during conflicts. He said the Community Relations Service would help de-escalate tensions and build up sufficient trust to get both sides of a conflict into a room for discussion and reconciliation.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News the portfolio and functions of the former Community Relations Service have been shifted into federal prosecutors' offices nationwide.\u00a0 The spokesperson said, \"This transition will save the Department over $11 million and further President Trump's mission of having a federal government that's more efficient and effective for the American people.\"",
      "CBS News has learned that approximately 30 laid off Justice Department employees have been called back to work for the agency.\u00a0 Those employees include some who worked for the Community Relations Service. \u00a0 According to one of the impacted employees, the workers have been reassigned to work for federal prosecutors.",
      "Nearly a dozen civil rights organizations and charities filed a civil lawsuit in Massachusetts, seeking a court order to prevent the dismantling of the Community Relations Service. In the lawsuit, in which NAACP St. Louis County and the Haitian Community Help & Support Center are among the plaintiffs, the groups argue the Trump administration's cuts to the office were unlawful and have stymied critical, ongoing work by the Community Relations Service.",
      "The suit said the Trump administration's decision disrupted ongoing de-escalation efforts, including \"mediation among community groups and law enforcement over a race-related policing incident when CRS abruptly [withdrew] from the process, leaving them without a mediator or any final agreement among the parties.\"",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was designed to help de-escalate tensions like those we see in Minneapolis and Portland, and for decades it succeeded in that mission,\" said Stacey Young, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Justice Connection, a group organized in 2025 to help represent and serve ousted Justice Department employees.",
      "Young said, \"For no logical reason, the administration discarded the experts who were best positioned to keep budding conflicts from turning violent. We're seeing the consequences of that fateful decision.\"",
      "A newly introduced federal funding bill aimed at averting a government shutdown next month would allocate $20 million in funding for the Community Relations Service, if approved .",
      "Support for the funding appears highly likely among House and Senate Democrats.",
      "",
      "Nearly 100 congressional Democrats have filed a court motion in support of the civil rights groups' legal challenge to the Community Relations Service cuts. Their motion argued the Trump administration was closing the office by \"executive fiat\" and is \"leaving local communities without the vital peacemaking support and services that the agency has long provided.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service was set up in the 1960's, amid metastasizing unrest, including fractured relationships between communities and police departments. The office was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also helped ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, and in Akron, Ohio in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police.",
      "Nam, the former Community Relations Service specialist, told CBS News he expects the Trump administration will shift some of the office's responsibility to its 93 U.S. attorneys' offices nationwide. He said the mission risks failing \u2013 or falling short \u2013 if it operates out of prosecutors' offices. And he added that the Community Relations Service was effective, in part, because it was not connected to law-enforcement agents, and was best positioned to build relationships with people in American communities.",
      "Nam told CBS News, \"Those people could have gone to Minneapolis immediately this week.\"",

      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" he said at the White House. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "On social media, Mr. Trump offered his support for the protesters, saying that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's warnings come as nationwide unrest challenging Iran's theocracy crossed the two-week mark. At least 538 people have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations, U.S.-based activists said, with fears the death toll is far higher. More than 10,600 people have been arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.",
      "The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, first reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision. The WSJ reports that Trump will receive further options on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has not moved any forces in preparation for potential military strikes.",
      "America has many capabilities and options, and cyber attacks could be among them, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the Trump administration approves of Elon Musk's decision to make Starlink terminals available in Iran. That satellite-based internet service could help protestors bypass government restrictions amid the ongoing communications blackout. Starlink did not respond to CBS inquiries.",
      "The U.S. already has heavy sanctions on Iran's regime, and in recent weeks has added to them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Mr. Trump has \"moral support\" for actions in Iran. He declined to answer a question about whether the U.S. would interdict vessels carrying Iranian oil for trading on the black market.",
      "\"I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back,\" Wright said.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers continue to claim that the protesters are agitators influenced by the U.S. and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the protests and other regional issues, according to US officials.",
      "Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran's parliament speaker and a hardliner who has run for the presidency in the past, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if the U.S. strikes the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said, according to the Associated Press. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "On Friday, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, said on X: \"Our enemies don't know Iran. In the past, the US failed due to their flawed planning. Today too, their flawed scheming will cause them to fail.\"",
      "There are currently 2,000 U.S. troops next door in Iraq, stationed on bases that have previously been targeted by Iranian-backed militias. There are also U.S. forces throughout the Mideast region, including significant hubs in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, and Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed.",
      "Back in June, Iran launched a missile strike on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in retaliation for the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that U.S. military action in Iran now to help the protesters would be a \"massive mistake.\"",
      "\"It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up,\" Kaine said. \"Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country.\"",
      "Kaine called for maintaining the sanctions pressure, noting that it had been successful against the Assad regime in Syria. Last December, armed rebels previously aligned with terror groups finally ousted Assad from power after a 14 year civil war.",
      "\"U.S. military action would bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States,\" he added.",
      "When asked on Sunday if shooting protesters would be the \"red line\" for Mr. Trump that would trigger U.S. action, a senior U.S. official declined to explicitly confirm it, saying \"only Trump can determine what the red line is.\"",
      "The White House and U.S. State Department have declined to answer questions about specific military options being considered.",
      "The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions imposed in part to curb its nuclear program.

      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "\"This would be disastrous,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone.\"",

      "\"If they're saying we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist,\" Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Prove to us what documentation you have that one, she was paid and two, that she was agitating when you can hear saying she's not mad, she's not upset, she's clearly trying to waive cars to bypass her. And so it's just this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.\"",
      "Amid an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Video of the incident from different vantage points has ricocheted across social media, with Mr. Trump and Vance insisting Good had instigated the shooting, although the footage is unclear whether Good was attempting to drive into the ICE agent or drive away.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Noem called it an \"act of domestic terrorism,\" doubling down on Sunday by alleging that Good had\u00a0 \"weaponized her vehicle to conduct an act of violence against the law enforcement officer and the public.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments on Sunday, a White House spokesperson said \"multiple videos\" contradicted Omar, and insisted\u00a0the \"ICE officer was clearly struck by Good's car.\"",
      "Minneapolis, which Omar represents in Congress, has been reeling since the shooting, with days of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis,\" and Gov. Tim Walz called the federal agency's narrative of the events \"bulls**t.\" Walz added, \"Don't believe this propaganda machine.\"",
      "Omar said she thinks \"it is really important for Americans to record\" ICE agents and law enforcement at protests to \"create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.\"",
      "\"What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars,\" Omar said. \"These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar denounced a surge of federal agents to Minneapolis targeting Somalis and other immigrants after a fraud scheme in the state, saying the Trump administration has sown \"confusion and chaos.\"",
      "\"It's not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it,\" Omar said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Minneapolis area now has one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security agents in any American city in recent years. There are more than 2,400 federal agents, more than double the number of local police officers, and the federal government intends to send hundreds more.",
      "The administration says the surge has been necessary to conduct both immigration enforcement and to investigate a growing fraud scandal in the state, the cost of which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion. The scandal dates back to 2021, when Biden administration Justice Department investigators first honed in on an at least $250 million COVID-era scam revolving around the Feeding Our Future program, a case that now includes more than 75 defendants.",
      "Most of the defendants are of Somali descent, leading President Trump and other Republican lawmakers to focus attention on the state's large Somali community, while threatening to suspend federal funding to the state across a broad array of programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and child care funding.",
      "These actions have drawn stiff criticism from local officials, including Omar.",
      "\"There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these programs, funding these programs,\" Omar said. \"The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Sunday that it was \"not surprising\" that the congresswoman is \"more concerned about Somali fraudsters being held accountable for their crimes than she is about the fraud taking place.\"",
      "With Minnesota in the eye of a federal storm, Gov. Tim Walz announced on Jan. 5 that he won't seek reelection. Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election, had become a focus of Republican criticism amid the scandal.",
      "He said last week that he was ending his gubernatorial reelection bid because of the fraud probe, implying that the focus on Minnesota was a political vendetta targeting him, and pleading for the White House to withdraw federal agents.",
      "\"If it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone,\" Walz said.",
      "Omar praised Walz's decision as selfless.",
      "\"He wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat,\" Omar said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias, as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Mr. Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Mr. Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though\u00a0the text was available online.\u00a0Mr. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen on Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Mr. Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials\u00a0review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"",
      "Then the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Mr. Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Mr. Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\"",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Mr. Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries, such as what had been part of Mr. Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Mr. Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Mr. Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said. \"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"",
      "For now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.",
      "And, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to\u00a0reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 except Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Mr. Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Mr. Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure, while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

      "The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing.",
      "And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator. That's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism.",
      "Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document, as she was doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record, to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.",
      "What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country.",
      "And we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see \u2013 from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was \u2013 that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good?",
      "The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes.",
      "Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully waving cars to get by. This agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared. She tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer, who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car, which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car.",
      "And so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place.",
      "And so, if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have that \u2013 one, that she was paid\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 two, that she was agitating, when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just \u2013 this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just quickly on that, you said accountability and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording, like she was doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I think it is fair\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing in their communities, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Though there's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",

He's going to make it \u2013 make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity.",
      "What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: It's just creating fear.",
      "What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration.",
      "There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: There is no reason have over 2,000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right? And\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: The state \u2013 the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described.",
      "None of this surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Do you \u2013 are you confident that that\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is, again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it \u2013 are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying, this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, there are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration.",
      "There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these pro \u2013 funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for P.R. purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that day care facilities were pocketing public funds.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And, as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, CBS went out and did its own investigation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think \u2013 there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I mean, this \u2013 that is what we want. We want to collaboratively work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state.",
      "What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",

      "What is the U.S. willing to do to help?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly, the president has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return.",
      "So, we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into any specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does he mean?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: What he means is, we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons.",
      "They have got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They \u2013 they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: \u2026 going down the tubes. And with the United States' influence now, by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to \u2013 we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday.",
      "That the president \u2013 or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about, because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said: \"Armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of U.S. citizenship or support for the U.S.\"",
      "The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the minister of the interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls them.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he safe in his position? Because, right now, the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station.",
      "But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business-minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So, yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it? Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process.",
      "The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25-years-in- decline oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as, like, as an American state-owned oil company, essentially?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: No.",
      "Today, we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yes, of course, quite likely, you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back in November, a U.S. judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal.",
      "The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of the Intel company? Do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility.",
      "The Citgo sale is part of \u2013 is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan government. And, of course, one \u2013 one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that.",
      "So, to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally, through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case, absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an oversupply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Right. Exactly. That's not \u2013 that's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly.",
      "Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies, because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability.",
      "So, President Trump is no \u2013 is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And, certainly, there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that \u2013 that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan government.",
      "And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, Secretary Rubio said there's a three-point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite.",
      "Even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership \u2013 they're already in Venezuela, we should say \u2013 said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50 percent. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there it's at least a year-and-a- half, two years.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and, likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition.",
      "We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government in Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there. But America is there as a\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a timeline?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Twenty-five years, this country has gone in decline.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: President Trump, out-of-the-box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: But, yes, I don't know the timeline of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

Including in Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, where thousands flooded the streets overnight and blocked roads, with some chanting, \"long live the king.\" While in the capital, Tehran, this video shows a mass protester holding up a photo of Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of Iran's last shah, who was ousted in 1979. A divisive figure with no organized movement inside Iran, but for some protesters, Pahlavi has become short-hand for \"anything but the Islamic Republic.\"",

      "IMTIAZ TYAB: You know, Margaret, on the one hand this feels very familiar. And on the other it feels very different. Iran, as you mentioned, has seen major uprisings before. The 2009 green movement, the 2019 fuel protests, and 2022's women life freedom movement. Each had its trigger. Each was met with brutal force. And each was eventually crushed.",
      "What's new now is the layers of crises facing the regime. Iran has a collapsing currency. There are chronic power and water shortages. I faces punishing sanctions. And it's still absorbing the aftershocks of last year's 12-day war with Israel.",
      "I was in Iran right after that war and people were already quietly questioning the regime's competence and its vulnerabilities. Now those vulnerabilities are loudly being tested in the streets. And there's another crucial difference here, symbolism.

      "Would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens. And much like Syrian citizens finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al Assad, and that brutal regime, without U.S. military intervention, it looks to me that Iran's doing the same.",
      "So, let's celebrate their freedom-loving spirit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's keep up the sanctions pressure which helped in Syria, and is helping, I think, dramatize the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s, and it would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning at least with that kind of uprising.",
      "Would you support any kind of help? I mean the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean or what should it look like?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I think, again, let's use sanctions. And in Syria, the Caesar Sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer.",
      "But military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS. Because ISIS was part of al Qaeda, there's a military authorization for use of U.S. force against ISIS.",

      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: We've worked with other nations to reduce them. But we didn't use military action against Bashar al Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this \u2013 in this protest moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways through sanctions but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid in your view?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes. Yes, yes, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the use of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions. He would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela.",
      "Do you think the Republicans, who were with you on this vote, will stay with you given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think they will. And I think more may join the five Republicans who voted with me.",
      "Let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert actions in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say, we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: That's all they voted for. And the fact that the president is going against them, just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, he said publicly, they should not be re-elected because they issued this call for congressional review.",
      "You brought up Greenland. This is \u2013 the territory that Denmark has broad governance over Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: And they should.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's prime minister publicly warned that it would mean the \"end of the NATO alliance\" if he carries out what he said, which as recently as Friday he said, \"I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Is there anything to stop the president from doing it, quote/unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop him. Both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be America first. It wouldn't just be the end of NATO. It would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat, and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a Priya.",
      "And I've talked to my Republican colleagues. They watch what the president has done in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish it even suggest this.",
      "We're not going to do it the hard way and we're not going to do it the easy way either. We're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front.",
      "Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Congresswoman, welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-FL): Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out.",
      "Why is it important for her to get in front of the president of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: OK, well, I don't think that the president is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this \u2013 she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, have won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won 70 by \u2013 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So, she has earned it. And I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the president. She knows the story better than anybody.",
      "I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she has earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that the \u2013 President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy secretary here say it could be \u2013 it could be years before we get to a transition. The president did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back? That the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go \u2013 when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back when on January 3rd we took Maduro out. They \u2013 I loved what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as a country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that, if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new groundbreaking, new model for foreign policy when he vis- a-vis the western hemisphere. So, Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three planned layout that we have \u2013 that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: So, she is part of the transition. And I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy. But Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked. CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Cabello had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio.",
      "Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.\" Let's don't make any \u2013 let's make sure, for your international audience, that.",
      "But I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into. And they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us. They do not have their resources. Now they know that we're going to go into this recovery. And that \u2013 and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces.",
      "They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening because we have not seen this before in the 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source \u2013 I have some sources that say that we were not able to locate him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: But at this hour, I would say that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons. And there are at least five Americans in those prisons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of this the Suns cartel, along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Listen, maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well. And he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with solid \u2013 in a solid \u2013 with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes. And I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out, and that we \u2013 that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see \u2013 like it happened, it happened two, three weeks ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the president tweeted today, \"Cuba gets no more money, no more oil.\" The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the president is saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami. You know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like magical. It's been 65 years, you know, Cuba is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And now I think they are \u2013 they are \u2013 they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's hanging by a threat. By a thread, I should say.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water. They have no electricity.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This past week marked five years since the January 6th attack on the Capitol. But honoring the first responders who protected the Capitol Building that day from a pro-Trump mob has been neither quick nor easy.",
      "A law passed by Congress in 2022 required the architect of the Capitol to produce a plaque paying tribute to law enforcement and give it a permanent location on the Capitol's west front within one year. Produce it, they did. Photos obtained by CBS News' Scott MacFarlane last year show the plaque itself. But more than five years late, the plaque has not found a permanent home on Capitol Hill.",
      "The delay is owed in part to House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose office says the law is, quote, \"not implementable\" because the law called for a tribute to law enforcement members, while the plaque itself honors whole departments rather than individual officers by name.",
      "North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis paid tribute to the actions of law enforcement on that day, calling it \"a wonderful stress test for democracy.\"",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR THOM TILLIS (R-NC): We heard thousands of people storm this Capitol. People died. Police officers were injured, hospitalized. One died shortly after January the 6th. A lot of people said that was a dark day for democracy. I would leave you with this, it was a great day for democracy because of the law enforcement officers, the people that kept us safe. Because you know what we did when confronted with thousands of thugs storming this building? We took a brief recess, we got ourselves together, the Capitol was secured. And before we left this compound, we came back and completed our constitutional duty to certify the election.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At Tillis' urging, the Senate voted by a procedure known as unanimous consent to make any changes needed to the original law in order to get the plaque installed once and for all. Not a single senator objected.",

      "\"That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,\" Wright said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "But Wright said the U.S. has not taken over running Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil and gas company. President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.",
      "\"No, today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers. And then that crude goes out into the market,\" Wright said. \"We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.\"",
      "U.S. forces captured and removed Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3 and brought them to New York to face federal charges alleging narco-terrorism and cocaine importation, among other charges.

      "\"With United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think\u2026.we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela,\" said Wright. \"This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.\"",
      "Wright said that means working with officials in the current government Maduro left behind, even though many of them have been indicted in the U.S. Those officials include Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, a strongman who has also previously been indicted in the U.S.",

We will see. Like it happened- it happened two, three weeks ago. Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the President tweeted today, Cuba gets no more money, no more oil. The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the President's saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami, you know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like, magical. It's been 65 years. You know, Cuba is- is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And- and now I think they are- they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's- it's hanging by your threat, by a thread I should say. The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water, they have no electricity, they have no food. They have nothing. So if you think that Maduro was weak. Cuba is even weaker, and now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- And that is a very big mistake. A very big mistake from Madame Sheibaum--",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has oversight in foreign relations and other key committees. Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options, but our reporting is no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time, would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens, and much like Syrian citizens, finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al-Assad and that brutal regime without U.S. military intervention, it looks to be that Iran is doing the same. So let's celebrate their freedom loving spirit. Let's keep up the sanctions pressure, which helped in Syria and is helping, I think, dramatize the- the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning, at least with that kind of uprising, would you support any kind of help? I mean, the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean? Or what should it look like?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I think again, let's use sanctions. In Syria, the Caesar sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al-Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer, but military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al-Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS, because ISIS was part of al-Qaeda, there's a Military Authorization for Use of U.S. Force against ISIS. We've worked with other nations to reduce them, but we didn't use military action against Bashar al-Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this- in this protest moment, let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways, through sanctions, but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid, in your view?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Yeah, yeah, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al-Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al-Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance, ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the U.S. of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions, he would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela. Do you think the Republicans who were with you on this vote will stay with you, given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think they will, and I think more may join. The five republicans who voted with me, let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert action in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years. What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly. That's all they voted for, and the fact that the president is going against them just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he said publicly they should not be re-elected because they- they issued this, this call for congressional review. You brought up Greenland. This is the- the territory that Denmark has broad governance over, Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously. We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's Prime Minister publicly warned that it would mean the end of the NATO alliance if he carries out what he said. Which as recently as Friday, he said, I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way. Is there anything to stop the president from doing it quote, unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop them, both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be \"America First.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a pariah. And I've talked to my Republican colleagues, they- they watch what the president has done is Venezue- in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish to even suggest this. We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way, either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front. Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will.\u00a0 Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2013",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT:\u00a0 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",

      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of the 76-year-old NATO alliance. Kaine echoed those comments Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents a large portion of that city. It's good to have you here.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: I represent the whole city. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing. And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator, that's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism. Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document as she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need. What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes these people are citizens. Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was- that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good? The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah. Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully, waving cars to get by this agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared, she tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer- who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car. Which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car, and so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place. And so if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have. That, one, that she was paid. Two, that she was agitating when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just- this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just quickly on that you said accountability, and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording like she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is fair for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There right now is a lot of heat on your state. Treasury Secretary Bessent called Minnesota ground zero for what may be the most egregious welfare scam in our nation's history to date. 85 of the 98 people who were charged by the Justice Department with this welfare scheme are Somali. And you know this, the treasury secretary is probing whether any of the money was somehow funneled outside the country, he actually issued new standards. He's going to make it- make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity. What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REP. OMAR: It's just creating fear. What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration. There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids. There is no reason have over 2000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right--",
      "REP. OMAR: The state- the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described. None of the surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Are you confident--",
      "REP. OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it- are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REP. OMAR: There are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration. There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these- funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes, and it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents, and it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that daycare facilities were pocketing public funds--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. OMAR: And as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, CBS went out and did its own investigation--",
      "REP. OMAR: --yeah which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think- there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted, but Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",
      "REP. OMAR: Because he wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there has been a sufficient level of accountability and ownership of the failure to have oversight here? Do you think this ends?",
      "REP. OMAR: That is what we want. We want to collaborately [sic] work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state. What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, the Chair Oversight Committee said that he wants to refer you to the Ethics Committee.",
      "REP. OMAR: I've been referred like 100 times, so go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's looking at your husband's income and net worth. He said it was tied to private equity investment funds, but he seems to be insinuating that you personally are tied into this welfare scam. How do you respond to that?",
      "REP. OMAR: Ever since I've gotten to Congress, they have been doing these sort of weird ethics investigations, none of them have yielded anything because I have been as transparent as I can be, and there is nothing wrong with any documentation that I have ever provided to the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for joining us today. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "\"As Greenlandic party leaders, we would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States' contempt for our country ends,\" the statement said.",

      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would mark\u00a0the end of NATO.",
      "The party leaders' statement said that \"the work on Greenland's future takes place in dialogue with the Greenlandic people and is prepared on the basis of international laws.\"",
      "\"No other country can interfere in this,\" they said. \"We must decide the future of our country ourselves, without pressure for quick decision, delay or interference from other countries.\"",
      "The statement was signed by Nielsen, Pele Broberg, M\u00fate B. Egede, Aleqa Hammond and Aqqalu C. Jerimiassen.",
      "Potter Pilu Chemnitz told CBS News partner BBC News that Greenlanders \"are all very tired of the U.S. president\" and \"just want to be left alone.\"",
      "Eighty-five percent of Greenlanders say they oppose a takeover by the U.S., the BBC reported. Most also say they favor independence from Denmark, though the Nordic country provides subsidies, military support and more for the autonomous territory.",
      "While Greenland is the largest island in the world, it has a population of around 57,000 and doesn't have its own military. Defense is provided by Denmark, whose military is dwarfed by that of the U.S.",
      "It's unclear how the remaining NATO members would respond if the U.S. decided to forcibly take control of the island or if they would come to Denmark's aid. Former Danish ambassador to NATO Michael Zilmer-Johns called Mr. Trump's ambitions \"an affront to an ally that has stood up with the U.S. in Afghanistan, in Iraq, all over the world.\"",

      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to CBS News Minnesota that lawmakers are required to provide seven days notice of congressional visits.",
      "\"For the safety of detainees and staff, and in compliance with the agency's mandate, the Members of Congress were notified that their visit was improper and out of compliance with existing court orders and policies which mandate that members of Congress must notify ICE at least seven days in advance of Congressional visits,\" McLaughlin wrote. \"Because they were out of compliance with this mandate, Representative Omar and her colleagues were denied entry to the facility.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "\"The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. \"And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.\"",
      "Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by\u00a0an ICE officer.",
      "The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Mr. Trump and Noem said the\u00a0ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.",
      "Vice President\u00a0JD Vance\u00a0blamed Good, calling it \"a tragedy of her own making,\" and said the ICE officer may have been \"sensitive\" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.",
      "But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.",

      "Homeland Security funding up for debate",
      "The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another\u00a0federal government shutdown\u00a0when money expires at the end of January.",
      "As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.",
      "\"We've been warning about this for an entire year,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat.",
      "The ICE officer \"needs to be held accountable,\" Frost said, \"but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.\"",
      "Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.",
      "Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.",
      "Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of the Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.",
      "\"More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,\" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.",
      "Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats are splintering between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.",
      "The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.",
      "Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.",
      "\"I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,\" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Greenland is 836,000 square miles of largely frozen ground northeast of Canada. So why does the White House say it \"should be part of the United States\"?",
    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",

    "summary": "Amid an indefinite wait for the full release of case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some lawmakers and Epstein survivors want the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate its handling of the files.",
    "story": [
      "Amid an indefinite wait for the full release of the case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some attention is shifting to a lesser-known \u2014 if not invisible \u2014 group of federal agents: The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.",
      "The Inspector General's office serves as an internal watchdog for the Justice Department. Its staff operate in obscurity in a set of small federal offices, some in communities far from Washington, D.C., including Atlanta, Tucson and Trenton. Its agents and investigators monitor for fraud, abuse and weaknesses inside the Justice Department.",
      "In a growing series of formal written requests, Epstein survivors, some members of Congress and Washington-based watchdog groups are asking the Inspector General's office to investigate if the Justice Department is mishandling its legal responsibility to release the Epstein files.",
      "The Trump administration and its Justice Department are under increasing scrutiny and pressure for their handling of the Epstein files.",
      "A federal law required the department to release its records on Epstein by Dec. 19, but government lawyers told a judge this week that only 1% of the files have been reviewed and released so far. The Justice Department released thousands of records\u00a0on Epstein in several tranches last month, but it says it needs more time to pore through millions of additional documents and redact survivors' names and other sensitive information.",
      "The Inspector General's office has a policy of not commenting on \u2014 or confirming \u2014 requests for investigation. CBS News has obtained copies of several requests for probes.",
      "In a formal request submitted Wednesday, ethics attorneys with the D.C.-based Democracy Defenders Fund asked the Inspector General to determine if the Justice Department had violated the law by redacting information improperly in the files, failing to justify its redactions or \"selectively releasing files for what appear to be partisan purposes.\"",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund is represented by Norm Eisen, a former Obama administration ethics official who has been critical of Trump.",
      "\"Congress has directed that the Department of Justice provide answers. Instead, the Department has continued to deny, deflect, and delay,\" Eisen said.",
      "A group of Senate Democrats and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also asked for a review. In a letter submitted Tuesday, the group said, \"A neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential.\"",
      "One of the senators, Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, told CBS News, \"We want to make sure all the documents are actually being presented. Following the law it's always important to have checks on that.\"",
      "Before the Justice Department began releasing the files last month, a handful of Senate Democrats also requested a review to determine whether any of the records had been \"tampered\" with or concealed.",
      "The Office of Inspector General has a history of working on high-profile investigations involving the Justice Department's handling of sex crime allegations. In 2021, the office made headlines when its review of the FBI's probe into convicted sex offender Larry Nassar, a former U.S. Gymnastics doctor, found the bureau learned Nassar had been accused of molesting gymnasts in 2015, but failed to act, leaving him free to continue to target victims for months.",
      "The office has also waded into the Epstein issue, carrying out a 2023 investigation into Epstein's 2019 death by suicide while in federal custody. The probe found \"negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures\" by Federal Bureau of Prisons staff.",
      "A 2025 semiannual report by the Inspector General said the office received more than 8,000 tips and allegations in a six-month span in late 2024. Approximately 100 of those allegations led to formal investigations by the office. A spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News about the letters submitted seeking new investigations about the Epstein files.",
      "In a series of interviews with CBS News, attorneys for survivors of Epstein's sex offenses said they have also sought or supported an Inspector General review of how the Justice Department is handling its responsibilities to manage the files.",
      "The partial, initial release of Epstein case files last month revealed that an early 1996 tip to the FBI by Epstein survivor Maria Farmer was not sufficiently pursued. Jennifer Freeman, an attorney who represents Farmer, told CBS News the Inspector General's office should look into \"how this significant failure took place.\"",
      "She said the office should also \"examine whether all Epstein-related files have been produced and are properly redacted, making sure victim-identifying information is not disclosed, and those federal employees who failed to address Maria's 1996 report are held accountable.\"",
      "Florida-based civil attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents Epstein survivors, told CBS News victims of Epstein's offenses \"want full transparency and an opportunity to talk with the Federal Government about what they want, and do not want, released.\"",
      "\"As for what is released, true transparency would allow independent review of redaction decisions, so the public can be confident nothing is being hidden unnecessarily,\" Kuvin said. \"Without third-party review, the public will never be able to have certainty that the Government is being honest and complying with the letter of the law.\"",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "summary": "A planned spacewalk outside the International Space Station was scrapped because of what NASA called a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member.",
    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers have been told to cut their mission short and return to Earth ahead of schedule because of an apparently serious medical issue affecting an unidentified crew member, NASA announced Thursday.",
      "\"Yesterday, January 7, a single crew member on board the station experienced a medical situation and is now stable,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a news conference.",
      "\"After discussions with Chief Health and Medical Officer Dr. J.D. Polk and leadership across the agency, I've come to the decision that it's in the best interest of our astronauts to return Crew 11 ahead of their planned departure (in mid February). ... We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

    "story": [
      "A spacewalk planned for Thursday outside the International Space Station was called off late Wednesday because of a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member, NASA said in a statement.",
      "An update shortly before midnight said the agency was exploring \"all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission.\"",
      "\"These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,\" the update said. \"We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.\"",
      "While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue \u2014 standard practice due to privacy concerns \u2014 the agency said \"the matter involved a single crew member who is stable.\"",
      "Space station commander Mike Fincke, flight engineer Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov launched to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship on August. 1.",
      "Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan.",
      "In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance.",
      "A second spacewalk by two yet-to-be-announced astronauts was planned for next week.",
      "But NASA called off the the first spacewalk earlier Wednesday, saying \"the agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon. Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.\"",
      "\"The situation is stable. NASA will share additional details, including a new date for the upcoming spacewalk, later.\"",
      "In a brief space-to-ground radio exchange just after 2:30 p.m. EST, Yui called mission control in Houston and asked for a private medical conference, or PMC.",
      "Mission control replied that a PMC, using a private radio channel, would be set up momentarily. Yui then asked if a flight surgeon was available and if flight controllers had a live camera view from inside the station.",
      "\"Houston, do we still have, like, a camera view in Node 2, uh, 3, lab?\" Yui asked.",
      "\"We don't have any internal cameras right now, but we can put the lab view in if you'd like,\" the mission control communicator replied.",
      "\"I appreciate that,\" Yui replied. He then asked: \"Do you have like a crew surgeon? ... A flight surgeon?\"",
      "No additional exchanges were heard. Later Wednesday, NASA's space station audio stream, normally carried live around-the-clock on YouTube, went silent without explanation.",

    "summary": "The hydrogen cloud is a remnant of the universe's early formation, NASA said in a news release.",
    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",

Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",

    "summary": "Google is souping up Gmail with features from its Gemini 3 AI app. Here's what to know \u2014 including how to opt out.",
    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",

      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed him\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",

      "The fire ripped through the Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson shortly after 3 a.m. on Saturday, authorities said. The synagogue was closed at the time and no congregants were injured in the blaze. The suspect sustained burns that were not life-threatening, the Jackson Fire Department said.",

      "Authorities have not disclosed the suspect's motive, but Jackson Fire Chief Charles Felton told CBS News the FBI is looking into the possibility of a hate crime. Felton said he couldn't release the suspect's ID yet due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "\"Acts of antisemitism, racism, and religious hatred are attacks on Jackson as a whole and will be treated as acts of terror against residents' safety and freedom to worship,\" Jackson Mayor John Horhn said in a statement. \"Targeting people because of their faith, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is morally wrong, un-American, and completely incompatible with the values of this city.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Jackson FBI told the Associated Press they are \"working with law enforcement partners on this investigation.\"",
      "The synagogue, the largest in Mississippi and the only one in Jackson, was the site of a Ku Klux Klan bombing in 1967 \u2014 a response to the congregation's role in civil rights activities, according to the\u00a0Institute of Southern Jewish Life, which also houses its office in the building.",
      "\"That history reminds us that attacks on houses of worship, whatever their cause, strike at the heart of our shared moral life,\" said CJ Rhodes, a prominent Black Baptist pastor in Jackson, in a Facebook post.",
      "\"This wasn't random vandalism \u2014 it was a deliberate, targeted attack on the Jewish community,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. \"That it has been attacked again, amid a surge of antisemitic incidents across the US, is a stark reminder: antisemitic violence is escalating, and it demands total condemnation and swift action from everyone.\"",
      "The ADL's regional chapter said it was in contact with the Beth Israel Congregation leadership and local leaders to provide support and resources.",
      "\"The fact that this historic synagogue, which was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1967 because of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum's civil rights advocacy, has once again been targeted is particularly painful and disturbing,\" ADL South Central regional director Lindsay Baach Friedmann said in a statement.",
      "The congregation is still assessing the damage and received outreach from other houses of worship, said Michele Schipper, CEO of the Institute of Southern Jewish Life and past president of the congregation.

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "\"This would be disastrous,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone.\"",

      "\"If they're saying we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist,\" Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Prove to us what documentation you have that one, she was paid and two, that she was agitating when you can hear saying she's not mad, she's not upset, she's clearly trying to waive cars to bypass her. And so it's just this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.\"",
      "Amid an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Video of the incident from different vantage points has ricocheted across social media, with Mr. Trump and Vance insisting Good had instigated the shooting, although the footage is unclear whether Good was attempting to drive into the ICE agent or drive away.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Noem called it an \"act of domestic terrorism,\" doubling down on Sunday by alleging that Good had\u00a0 \"weaponized her vehicle to conduct an act of violence against the law enforcement officer and the public.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments on Sunday, a White House spokesperson said \"multiple videos\" contradicted Omar, and insisted\u00a0the \"ICE officer was clearly struck by Good's car.\"",
      "Minneapolis, which Omar represents in Congress, has been reeling since the shooting, with days of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis,\" and Gov. Tim Walz called the federal agency's narrative of the events \"bulls**t.\" Walz added, \"Don't believe this propaganda machine.\"",
      "Omar said she thinks \"it is really important for Americans to record\" ICE agents and law enforcement at protests to \"create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.\"",
      "\"What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars,\" Omar said. \"These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar denounced a surge of federal agents to Minneapolis targeting Somalis and other immigrants after a fraud scheme in the state, saying the Trump administration has sown \"confusion and chaos.\"",
      "\"It's not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it,\" Omar said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Minneapolis area now has one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security agents in any American city in recent years. There are more than 2,400 federal agents, more than double the number of local police officers, and the federal government intends to send hundreds more.",
      "The administration says the surge has been necessary to conduct both immigration enforcement and to investigate a growing fraud scandal in the state, the cost of which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion. The scandal dates back to 2021, when Biden administration Justice Department investigators first honed in on an at least $250 million COVID-era scam revolving around the Feeding Our Future program, a case that now includes more than 75 defendants.",
      "Most of the defendants are of Somali descent, leading President Trump and other Republican lawmakers to focus attention on the state's large Somali community, while threatening to suspend federal funding to the state across a broad array of programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and child care funding.",
      "These actions have drawn stiff criticism from local officials, including Omar.",
      "\"There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these programs, funding these programs,\" Omar said. \"The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Sunday that it was \"not surprising\" that the congresswoman is \"more concerned about Somali fraudsters being held accountable for their crimes than she is about the fraud taking place.\"",
      "With Minnesota in the eye of a federal storm, Gov. Tim Walz announced on Jan. 5 that he won't seek reelection. Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election, had become a focus of Republican criticism amid the scandal.",
      "He said last week that he was ending his gubernatorial reelection bid because of the fraud probe, implying that the focus on Minnesota was a political vendetta targeting him, and pleading for the White House to withdraw federal agents.",
      "\"If it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone,\" Walz said.",
      "Omar praised Walz's decision as selfless.",
      "\"He wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat,\" Omar said.",

    "summary": "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias, as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Mr. Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Mr. Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though\u00a0the text was available online.\u00a0Mr. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen on Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Mr. Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials\u00a0review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"",
      "Then the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Mr. Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Mr. Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\"",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Mr. Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries, such as what had been part of Mr. Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Mr. Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Mr. Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said. \"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"",
      "For now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.",
      "And, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to\u00a0reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 except Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Mr. Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Mr. Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure, while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Four days after an ICE agent shot and killed a protester in Minneapolis, the struggle to own the narrative of what exactly happened continues, and scrutiny over the use of force by ICE as part of the Trump administration's deportation process intensifies.",
      "We will talk with Minneapolis area Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, then turn to the New Year's eruption of unrest around the world. As the deadly protests in Iran spread, are the regime's days numbered? And what's the Trump administration's red line when it comes to taking more action against Iran?",

      "We begin in Minneapolis, which now has the largest concentration of DHS federal agents in an American city in recent years.",
      "We begin with homeland security correspondent Nicole Sganga in Minneapolis.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PROTESTER: Say her name!",
      "PROTESTERS: Renee Good!",
      "NICOLE SGANGA (voice-over): This weekend, tens of thousands took to the streets in anti-ICE demonstrations nationwide, in Minneapolis braving subfreezing weather to mark where 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent.",
      "Days after the fatal shooting, you can see that hundreds of protesters are still showing up. Minneapolis is a city still on edge. They're saying immigrants are welcome here, demanding answers and a fair investigation.",
      "State investigators say federal officials have denied them access to evidence in the investigation of Good's death.",
      "KEITH ELLISON (Minnesota Attorney General): The current posture is that the investigation is one that the feds want to do without state involvement.",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: Sources tell CBS News the Department of Homeland Security is planning to send hundreds of additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to the Twin Cities this month, adding to a footprint of roughly 2,400 DHS personnel.",
      "On Saturday, Democratic members from Minnesota, including Representative Ilhan Omar, were blocked from touring an ICE detention facility just outside of Minneapolis.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-Minnesota): What happened today is a blatant attempt to obstruct members of Congress from doing their oversight duties.",
      "NICOLE SGANGA: A CBS News analysis has found ICE agents have fired their weapons in at least eight incidents over the past four months, resulting in three deaths. Nearly all of the shootings involved vehicles.",

      "NICOLE SGANGA: CBS News has learned, prosecutors within the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division will also not join the FBI's investigation, breaking with past practice and raising further questions about just how far the federal inquiry will go \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Nicole Sganga in Minneapolis.",
      "And we're joined now by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents a large portion of that city.",
      "It's good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-Minnesota): I represent the whole city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.",
      "The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing.",
      "And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator. That's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism.",
      "Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document, as she was doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record, to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.",
      "What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country.",
      "And we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see \u2013 from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was \u2013 that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good?",
      "The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes.",
      "Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully waving cars to get by. This agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared. She tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer, who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car, which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car.",
      "And so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place.",
      "And so, if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have that \u2013 one, that she was paid\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 two, that she was agitating, when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just \u2013 this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just quickly on that, you said accountability and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording, like she was doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I think it is fair\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing in their communities, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Though there's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There right now is a lot of heat on your state.",
      "Treasury Secretary Bessent called Minnesota ground zero for what may be the most egregious welfare scam in our nation's history to date; 85 of the 98 people who were charged by the Justice Department with this welfare scheme are Somali.",
      "And you know this. The treasury secretary is probing whether any of the money was somehow funneled outside the country. He actually issued new standards. He's going to make it \u2013 make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity.",
      "What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: It's just creating fear.",
      "What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration.",
      "There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: There is no reason have over 2,000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right? And\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: The state \u2013 the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described.",
      "None of this surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Do you \u2013 are you confident that that\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is, again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it \u2013 are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying, this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, there are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration.",
      "There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these pro \u2013 funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for P.R. purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that day care facilities were pocketing public funds.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And, as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, CBS went out and did its own investigation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think \u2013 there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Because he wants to focus on defending our state, and not defending a seat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there \u2013 do you think there has been a sufficient level of accountability and ownership of the failure to have oversight here? Do you think this ends?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I mean, this \u2013 that is what we want. We want to collaboratively work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state.",
      "What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, the chair, Oversight Committee, said that he wants to refer you to the Ethics Committee.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I have been referred like 100 times, so go ahead.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's looking at your husband's income and net worth. He said it was tied to private equity investment funds, but he seems to be insinuating that you personally are tied into this welfare scam. How do you respond to that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I mean, ever since I have gotten to Congress, they have been doing these sort of weird ethics investigations. None of them have yielded anything, because I have been as transparent as I can be, and there is nothing wrong with any documentation that I have ever provided to the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for joining us today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Thank you.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the U.S. This comes just one week after he said the U.S. would run that country.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week.",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of U.S. oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there.",
      "Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States secretary of energy, Chris Wright.",
      "Good to have you here in person.",
      "CHRIS WRIGHT (U.S. Energy Secretary): Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, this country reliant on oil to keep its government- controlled economy afloat, the president has been briefed on military options.",
      "What is the U.S. willing to do to help?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly, the president has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return.",
      "So, we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into any specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil, any more activity on that front?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK.",
      "Let me ask you about Venezuela\u2026",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where you have been very focused and very central to the president's policy.",
      "The president said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them, to protect them. We will.",
      "Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now. But what we\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does he mean?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: What he means is, we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons.",
      "They have got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They \u2013 they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: \u2026 going down the tubes. And with the United States' influence now, by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to \u2013 we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday.",
      "That the president \u2013 or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about, because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said: \"Armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of U.S. citizenship or support for the U.S.\"",
      "The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the minister of the interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of.",
      "But we should be cautious. Look, this is, as I say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Colectivos have been running wild over \u2013 over Venezuela for \u2013 for over a decade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: So, yes, you're not going to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls them.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he safe in his position? Because, right now, the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station.",
      "But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business-minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So, yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it? Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process.",
      "The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25-years-in- decline oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as, like, as an American state-owned oil company, essentially?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: No.",
      "Today, we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yes, of course, quite likely, you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back in November, a U.S. judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal.",
      "The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of the Intel company? Do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility.",
      "The Citgo sale is part of \u2013 is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan government. And, of course, one \u2013 one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that.",
      "So, to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally, through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case, absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an oversupply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Right. Exactly. That's not \u2013 that's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly.",
      "Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies, because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability.",
      "So, President Trump is no \u2013 is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And, certainly, there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that \u2013 that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan government.",
      "And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, Secretary Rubio said there's a three-point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite.",
      "Even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership \u2013 they're already in Venezuela, we should say \u2013 said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50 percent. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there it's at least a year-and-a- half, two years.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and, likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition.",
      "We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government in Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there. But America is there as a\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a timeline?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Twenty-five years, this country has gone in decline.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: President Trump, out-of-the-box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: But, yes, I don't know the timeline of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: It's not weeks. It's more months. Could be a year or two. Could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We want to take note of something that President Trump told \"The New York Times\" last week as we move on to a discussion of the international challenges that the country faces. He was asked in a wide-ranging interview if there were any limits on his global powers, and Mr. Trump said, \"yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"",
      "One test looming large at the moment is in Iran, where the death toll from violent protests is growing as the government intensifies its crackdown and, at this point, there is no alternative government standing by if this regime should fall.",
      "Imtiaz Tyab has the latest reporting from London.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB (voice over): They chant, \"death to the dictator,\" as unrest across Iran only intensifies and as the death toll rises. International rights groups say at least 190 demonstrators have been killed and more than 2,300 arrested as security forces continue to crack down hard.",
      "Cell phone video shows government buildings on fire and even a mosque. Scenes once unthinkable as symbols of the theocratic regime are targeted by protester.",
      "These videos, verified by CBS News and other media outlets using satellite imaging, GPS codes, and sources on the ground show anger that began over rising inflation and a collapsing currency has morphed into something more explosive, open defiance of the repressive state. Including in Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, where thousands flooded the streets overnight and blocked roads, with some chanting, \"long live the king.\" While in the capital, Tehran, this video shows a mass protester holding up a photo of Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of Iran's last shah, who was ousted in 1979. A divisive figure with no organized movement inside Iran, but for some protesters, Pahlavi has become short-hand for \"anything but the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "FEMALE: America has already lost the game.",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB (voice over): Iranian state TV has accused the U.S. of being behind the unrest and aired images of pro-government rallies. But scenes like this continue to tell a different story as Iran's leadership only tightens its grip, including imposing a sweeping communications blackout that has seen the internet cut and international calls blocked. President Trump has warned Tehran against killing protesters.",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And if they start killing people, like they have in the past, we will get involved. We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground.",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB (voice over): As President Trump pledges to support the protesters, a senior U.S. official has confirmed to CBS News, the president has been briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran.",
      "(END VT)",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB (on camera): And in his first public remarks since the protests have intensified, Iran's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, accused the U.S. and Israel of, quote, \"sowing chaos and disorder\" by ordering what he described as riots. He also promised to address the economic crisis that triggered the unrest. The question now is whether Iranians believe him or whether it's already too late.",
      "Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz, I know you've been covering Iran for a long time, including on the ground. There have been protests before that have been just brutally suppressed. What's different this time?",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB: You know, Margaret, on the one hand this feels very familiar. And on the other it feels very different. Iran, as you mentioned, has seen major uprisings before. The 2009 green movement, the 2019 fuel protests, and 2022's women life freedom movement. Each had its trigger. Each was met with brutal force. And each was eventually crushed.",
      "What's new now is the layers of crises facing the regime. Iran has a collapsing currency. There are chronic power and water shortages. I faces punishing sanctions. And it's still absorbing the aftershocks of last year's 12-day war with Israel.",
      "I was in Iran right after that war and people were already quietly questioning the regime's competence and its vulnerabilities. Now those vulnerabilities are loudly being tested in the streets. And there's another crucial difference here, symbolism. We've seen statues of the supreme leader set on fire, surveillance cameras ripped down, as well as chants for the monarchy.",
      "This is not nostalgia. This is a rejection of the Islamic Republic. And the danger for the leaders in Tehran is simple. Once the (INAUDIBLE) breaks, it's very hard to put back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz Tyab, we'll continue to track these protests. Thank you, Imtiaz.",
      "We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has Oversight, Foreign Relations and other key committees.",
      "Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options. But our reporting is, no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time.",
      "Would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens. And much like Syrian citizens finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al Assad, and that brutal regime, without U.S. military intervention, it looks to me that Iran's doing the same.",
      "So, let's celebrate their freedom-loving spirit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's keep up the sanctions pressure which helped in Syria, and is helping, I think, dramatize the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s, and it would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning at least with that kind of uprising.",
      "Would you support any kind of help? I mean the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean or what should it look like?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I think, again, let's use sanctions. And in Syria, the Caesar Sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer.",
      "But military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS. Because ISIS was part of al Qaeda, there's a military authorization for use of U.S. force against ISIS.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: We've worked with other nations to reduce them. But we didn't use military action against Bashar al Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this \u2013 in this protest moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways through sanctions but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid in your view?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes. Yes, yes, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the use of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions. He would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela.",
      "Do you think the Republicans, who were with you on this vote, will stay with you given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think they will. And I think more may join the five Republicans who voted with me.",
      "Let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert actions in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say, we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: That's all they voted for. And the fact that the president is going against them, just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, he said publicly, they should not be re-elected because they issued this call for congressional review.",
      "You brought up Greenland. This is \u2013 the territory that Denmark has broad governance over Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: And they should.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's prime minister publicly warned that it would mean the \"end of the NATO alliance\" if he carries out what he said, which as recently as Friday he said, \"I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Is there anything to stop the president from doing it, quote/unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop him. Both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be America first. It wouldn't just be the end of NATO. It would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat, and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a Priya.",
      "And I've talked to my Republican colleagues. They watch what the president has done in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish it even suggest this.",
      "We're not going to do it the hard way and we're not going to do it the easy way either. We're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front.",
      "Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Congresswoman, welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-FL): Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out.",
      "Why is it important for her to get in front of the president of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: OK, well, I don't think that the president is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this \u2013 she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, have won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won 70 by \u2013 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So, she has earned it. And I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the president. She knows the story better than anybody.",
      "I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she has earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that the \u2013 President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy secretary here say it could be \u2013 it could be years before we get to a transition. The president did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back? That the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go \u2013 when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back when on January 3rd we took Maduro out. They \u2013 I loved what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as a country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that, if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new groundbreaking, new model for foreign policy when he vis- a-vis the western hemisphere. So, Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three planned layout that we have \u2013 that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: So, she is part of the transition. And I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy. But Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked. CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Cabello had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio.",
      "Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.\" Let's don't make any \u2013 let's make sure, for your international audience, that.",
      "But I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into. And they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us. They do not have their resources. Now they know that we're going to go into this recovery. And that \u2013 and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces.",
      "They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening because we have not seen this before in the 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source \u2013 I have some sources that say that we were not able to locate him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: But at this hour, I would say that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons. And there are at least five Americans in those prisons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of this the Suns cartel, along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Listen, maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well. And he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with solid \u2013 in a solid \u2013 with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes. And I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out, and that we \u2013 that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see \u2013 like it happened, it happened two, three weeks ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the president tweeted today, \"Cuba gets no more money, no more oil.\" The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the president is saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami. You know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like magical. It's been 65 years, you know, Cuba is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And now I think they are \u2013 they are \u2013 they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's hanging by a threat. By a thread, I should say.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water. They have no electricity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: They have no food. They have nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: So, if you think the Maduro was weak, Cuba is even weaker.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: And now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So, that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch what happens there next.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: And that is a very big mistake. Very big mistake from Madam Sheinbaum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, Congresswoman.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This past week marked five years since the January 6th attack on the Capitol. But honoring the first responders who protected the Capitol Building that day from a pro-Trump mob has been neither quick nor easy.",
      "A law passed by Congress in 2022 required the architect of the Capitol to produce a plaque paying tribute to law enforcement and give it a permanent location on the Capitol's west front within one year. Produce it, they did. Photos obtained by CBS News' Scott MacFarlane last year show the plaque itself. But more than five years late, the plaque has not found a permanent home on Capitol Hill.",
      "The delay is owed in part to House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose office says the law is, quote, \"not implementable\" because the law called for a tribute to law enforcement members, while the plaque itself honors whole departments rather than individual officers by name.",
      "North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis paid tribute to the actions of law enforcement on that day, calling it \"a wonderful stress test for democracy.\"",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR THOM TILLIS (R-NC): We heard thousands of people storm this Capitol. People died. Police officers were injured, hospitalized. One died shortly after January the 6th. A lot of people said that was a dark day for democracy. I would leave you with this, it was a great day for democracy because of the law enforcement officers, the people that kept us safe. Because you know what we did when confronted with thousands of thugs storming this building? We took a brief recess, we got ourselves together, the Capitol was secured. And before we left this compound, we came back and completed our constitutional duty to certify the election.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At Tillis' urging, the Senate voted by a procedure known as unanimous consent to make any changes needed to the original law in order to get the plaque installed once and for all. Not a single senator objected.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:23:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,\" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Sunday that it's \"quite likely\" American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela's oil industry as the country moves on following the removal of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,\" Wright said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "But Wright said the U.S. has not taken over running Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil and gas company. President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.",
      "\"No, today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers. And then that crude goes out into the market,\" Wright said. \"We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.\"",
      "U.S. forces captured and removed Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3 and brought them to New York to face federal charges alleging narco-terrorism and cocaine importation, among other charges. Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.",
      "\"With United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think\u2026.we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela,\" said Wright. \"This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.\"",
      "Wright said that means working with officials in the current government Maduro left behind, even though many of them have been indicted in the U.S. Those officials include Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, a strongman who has also previously been indicted in the U.S.",
      "\"We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,\" Wright said.",
      "Still, Wright said, \"we don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today.\"",
      "\"We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela,\" Wright said.",
      "President Trump on Sunday in a social media post warned another U.S. adversary in the region, Cuba, that it is cut off from Venezuelan oil, writing the island nation should \"make a deal before it's too late.\" But Wright told Brennan off camera Sunday that the U.S. is not currently asking Mexico \u2014 a key fuel supplier to Cuba \u2014 to cut off oil to the isolated Caribbean island nation.",

    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, as the Trump administration was intensifying immigration raids in Minnesota, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three.",
      "As videos of the shooting circulated online, different accounts of what happened emerged, putting Minnesota officials sharply at odds with the Trump administration.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described Good's interaction with ICE agents as \"an act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey responded to the administration's portrayal, saying, \"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bull****.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance placed the blame on Good, telling reporters, \"I can believe that her death is a tragedy, while also recognizing that it's a tragedy of her own making.\"",
      "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, meanwhile, said, \"People in positions of power have already passed judgement. From the president, to the vice president, to Kristi Noem, [they] have stood and told you things that are verifiably false.\"",
      "More than 2,000 federal agents arrived in Minnesota this past week \u2013 the largest deployment of its kind under President Trump \u2013 in what the administration says is a crackdown on both fraud and illegal immigration.",
      "The fatal shooting comes amid a turbulent time for the state, which has been reeling from a welfare scandal.",
      "The situation has remained tense in Minneapolis. State investigators say federal officials have denied them access to evidence in the investigation of Good's death. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison stated, \"The current posture is that the investigation is one that the feds want to do without state involvement.\"",
      "Minneapolis public schools cancelled classes. Vigils popped up citywide. And demonstrators are taking to the streets with familiar outrage.",
      "The protests sparked by Good's death have revived memories of another scene that played out more than five years ago, when George Floyd was killed at the hands of police less than a mile from where Good was murdered.",
      "Former Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton was at a vigil being held outside her church, less than two blocks from the site of Wednesday's shooting. \"I'm feeling angry, frustrated, but I don't feel hopeless,\" Belton said.",
      "\"We're not powerless to act, but we have to speak with one voice,\" she said. \"This is a time for action. This is not a time for us to be silent.\"",
      "Asked what that action might look like, Belton replied, \"Action means demanding that there be an investigation of what happened in our community. What happened? Why was Renee Nicole Good killed? We need answers. And if we don't do this as a nation, I don't know, I fear that it could happen again. And that would be the real tragedy.\"",

    "story": [
      "It's not every day that a 202-year-old address to Congress goes viral. Yes, the Monroe Doctrine (that thing you learned about in high school) is suddenly a hot topic.",
      "Historian Jay Sexton is author of a book on the Monroe Doctrine, and now his phone is blowing up: \"My five minutes of fame turned into a week of fame,\" he said.",
      "Sexton wrote about how just three paragraphs in an 1823 address by our nation's fifth president, James Monroe, have been used to justify U.S. actions in Latin America ever since. Monroe's original message was to Europe: \"Stay out of the Americas!\"",
      "\"It wasn't a pronouncement of law or statute,\" said Sexton. \"It was simply a statement made by a president to Congress about what foreign powers could not do in the Western hemisphere. That's it.\"",
      "It was decades before that statement would be ordained a \"doctrine.\" President James K. Polk invoked it to justify war with Mexico\u00a0in 1846, and expand the U.S. by nearly half.",
      "Cut to 1904, and President Teddy Roosevelt brandishing his big stick, proclaiming his own corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Sexton said, \"He's the key figure. When Roosevelt looks at the Caribbean and Central America, he sees instability. He sees concerns that the European rivals might intervene. And he says in order to prevent that from happening, the United States needed to take preemptive action of its own.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is part of the justification, 'Well, we kept the Europeans out of this hemisphere, so you have to keep your house in order \u2013 or we'll do it for you'?\"",
      "\"That's very much how Roosevelt put it,\" Sexton replied.",
      "Enter the U.S. Marines, who by the 1920s were \"boots on the ground\" in half a dozen Latin American and Caribbean countries, attempting to stabilize them, and \u2013 this is crucial \u2013 protect U.S. business interests, from bananas in Honduras, to banks in Haiti.",
      "But these occupations soon became bloody quagmires, with hundreds of military and tens of thousands of civilian casualties. \"They're known as the Banana Wars,\" Sexton said. \"These are the forever wars of their era. They begin to become very, very unpopular.\"",
      "The Banana Wars ended with the U.S. withdrawal from Haiti in 1934. And after World War II, the Monroe Doctrine was barely mentioned. In 1962, when the Soviets sent missiles into Cuba, according to Sexton, JFK had this to say: \"The Monroe Doctrine, what the hell is that?\"",
      "But now, it's back.",
      "In discussing last week's incursion into Venezuela, President Trump has cloaked his foreign policy in a once-again revived Monroe Doctrine: \"Monroe Doctrine, we sort of forgot about it. It was very important, but we forgot about it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We don't forget about it anymore.\"",

    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump was briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran, a senior U.S. official confirmed Sunday.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to lay out his red line for action on Friday when he warned that if the Iranian government began \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",
      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" he said at the White House. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "On social media, Mr. Trump offered his support for the protesters, saying that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's warnings come as nationwide unrest challenging Iran's theocracy crossed the two-week mark. At least 538 people have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations, U.S.-based activists said, with fears the death toll is far higher. More than 10,600 people have been arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.",
      "The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, first reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision. The WSJ reports that Trump will receive further options on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has not moved any forces in preparation for potential military strikes.",
      "America has many capabilities and options, and cyber attacks could be among them, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the Trump administration approves of Elon Musk's decision to make Starlink terminals available in Iran. That satellite-based internet service could help protestors bypass government restrictions amid the ongoing communications blackout. Starlink did not respond to CBS inquiries.",
      "The U.S. already has heavy sanctions on Iran's regime, and in recent weeks has added to them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Mr. Trump has \"moral support\" for actions in Iran. He declined to answer a question about whether the U.S. would interdict vessels carrying Iranian oil for trading on the black market.",
      "\"I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back,\" Wright said.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers continue to claim that the protesters are agitators influenced by the U.S. and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the protests and other regional issues, according to US officials.",
      "Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran's parliament speaker and a hardliner who has run for the presidency in the past, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if the U.S. strikes the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said, according to the Associated Press. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "On Friday, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, said on X: \"Our enemies don't know Iran. In the past, the US failed due to their flawed planning. Today too, their flawed scheming will cause them to fail.\"",
      "There are currently 2,000 U.S. troops next door in Iraq, stationed on bases that have previously been targeted by Iranian-backed militias. There are also U.S. forces throughout the Mideast region, including significant hubs in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, and Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed.",
      "Back in June, Iran launched a missile strike on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in retaliation for the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that U.S. military action in Iran now to help the protesters would be a \"massive mistake.\"",
      "\"It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up,\" Kaine said. \"Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country.\"",
      "Kaine called for maintaining the sanctions pressure, noting that it had been successful against the Assad regime in Syria. Last December, armed rebels previously aligned with terror groups finally ousted Assad from power after a 14 year civil war.",
      "\"U.S. military action would bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States,\" he added.",
      "When asked on Sunday if shooting protesters would be the \"red line\" for Mr. Trump that would trigger U.S. action, a senior U.S. official declined to explicitly confirm it, saying \"only Trump can determine what the red line is.\"",
      "The White House and U.S. State Department have declined to answer questions about specific military options being considered.",
      "The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions imposed in part to curb its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.",

The death toll of people who have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations jumped to at least 538 people, U.S.-based activists said.",
      "With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. But according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of contacts inside the country, the death toll from clashes between protesters and Iran's security forces has climbed steadily.",
      "Of those killed, 490 are protesters and 48 are members of the security forces, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said, warning the toll is likely to go up. Another 10,600 people have been detained over the two weeks of protests, the group said. \u00a0The Iranian government has not offered any overall casualty figures for the demonstrations.",
      "Faced with its most significant challenge in years, Iran's theocratic rulers have issued increasingly stern threats to what it claims are agitators being influenced by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and answered threats of a U.S. intervention by President Trump with corresponding threats of their own.",
      "Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by Mr. Trump. Qalibaf made the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting: \"Death to America!\"",

      "\"The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,\" Qalibaf said.",

      "It remains unclear just how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after seeing its air defenses destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel, which also saw the U.S. carry out strikes against its nuclear facilities. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",

      "\"The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,\" the Human Rights Activists News Agency said. \"At the same time, reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.\"",
      "In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 450 miles northeast of Tehran, video purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.",
      "Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 500 miles southeast of Tehran.",
      "Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression.

      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Republican of Florida, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami. Congresswoman, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "REP. MAR\u00cdA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out. Why is it important for her to get in front of the President of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Okay, well, I don't think that the President is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this- she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, had won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won by 70 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the Presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So she has earned it, and I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the President. She knows the story better than anybody. I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she's earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy Secretary here say it could be- it could be years before we get to a transition. The President did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back, that the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean, how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back, when on January 3, we took Maduro out. They- I love what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as the country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new ground breaking, new model for foreign policy, when he- vis-a-vis the western hemisphere. So Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three-planned layout that we have, that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed. So she is part of the transition, and I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves. She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy, but Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the Minister of the Interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked, CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Caballo had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio. Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all Alibaba and the 40 Thieves. Let's- don't make any- let's make sure, for your international audience, that- but- but I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into, and they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us, they do not have their resources now they know that we're going to go into this recovery, and that- and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces. They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening, because we have not seen this before in 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source- I have some sources that say that, that we were not able to locate him, but it did- at this hour, I would say that, that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons, and there are at least five Americans in those prisons--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of the Sun's cartel along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Listen, maybe- maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well, and he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with- with solid in- a solid- with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes and- and I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out and that we- that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of- of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see. Like it happened- it happened two, three weeks ago. Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the President tweeted today, Cuba gets no more money, no more oil. The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the President's saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami, you know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like, magical. It's been 65 years. You know, Cuba is- is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And- and now I think they are- they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's- it's hanging by your threat, by a thread I should say. The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water, they have no electricity, they have no food. They have nothing. So if you think that Maduro was weak. Cuba is even weaker, and now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- And that is a very big mistake. A very big mistake from Madame Sheibaum--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- what happens next. \u00a0 All right. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has oversight in foreign relations and other key committees. Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options, but our reporting is no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time, would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens, and much like Syrian citizens, finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al-Assad and that brutal regime without U.S. military intervention, it looks to be that Iran is doing the same. So let's celebrate their freedom loving spirit. Let's keep up the sanctions pressure, which helped in Syria and is helping, I think, dramatize the- the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning, at least with that kind of uprising, would you support any kind of help? I mean, the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean? Or what should it look like?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I think again, let's use sanctions. In Syria, the Caesar sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al-Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer, but military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al-Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS, because ISIS was part of al-Qaeda, there's a Military Authorization for Use of U.S. Force against ISIS. We've worked with other nations to reduce them, but we didn't use military action against Bashar al-Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this- in this protest moment, let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways, through sanctions, but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid, in your view?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Yeah, yeah, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al-Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al-Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance, ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the U.S. of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions, he would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela. Do you think the Republicans who were with you on this vote will stay with you, given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think they will, and I think more may join. The five republicans who voted with me, let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert action in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years. What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly. That's all they voted for, and the fact that the president is going against them just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he said publicly they should not be re-elected because they- they issued this, this call for congressional review. You brought up Greenland. This is the- the territory that Denmark has broad governance over, Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously. We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's Prime Minister publicly warned that it would mean the end of the NATO alliance if he carries out what he said. Which as recently as Friday, he said, I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way. Is there anything to stop the president from doing it quote, unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop them, both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be \"America First.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a pariah. And I've talked to my Republican colleagues, they- they watch what the president has done is Venezue- in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish to even suggest this. We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way, either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front. Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will.\u00a0 Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2013",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT:\u00a0 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",

      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with about 185 cities facing demonstrations. One monitoring group has reported thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths since the protests began.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "As of Saturday, protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",

      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",

      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA. At least 538 people have been killed, the group said Sunday, Jan. 11, including 490 protesters and 48 members of the security services.",

      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",

      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Jan. 11 that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power, has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents a large portion of that city. It's good to have you here.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: I represent the whole city. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing. And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator, that's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism. Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document as she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need. What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes these people are citizens. Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was- that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good? The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah. Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully, waving cars to get by this agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared, she tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer- who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car. Which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car, and so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place. And so if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have. That, one, that she was paid. Two, that she was agitating when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just- this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just quickly on that you said accountability, and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording like she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is fair for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There right now is a lot of heat on your state. Treasury Secretary Bessent called Minnesota ground zero for what may be the most egregious welfare scam in our nation's history to date. 85 of the 98 people who were charged by the Justice Department with this welfare scheme are Somali. And you know this, the treasury secretary is probing whether any of the money was somehow funneled outside the country, he actually issued new standards. He's going to make it- make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity. What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REP. OMAR: It's just creating fear. What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration. There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids. There is no reason have over 2000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right--",
      "REP. OMAR: The state- the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described. None of the surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Are you confident--",
      "REP. OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it- are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REP. OMAR: There are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration. There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these- funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes, and it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents, and it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that daycare facilities were pocketing public funds--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. OMAR: And as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, CBS went out and did its own investigation--",
      "REP. OMAR: --yeah which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think- there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted, but Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",
      "REP. OMAR: Because he wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there has been a sufficient level of accountability and ownership of the failure to have oversight here? Do you think this ends?",
      "REP. OMAR: That is what we want. We want to collaborately [sic] work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state. What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, the Chair Oversight Committee said that he wants to refer you to the Ethics Committee.",
      "REP. OMAR: I've been referred like 100 times, so go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's looking at your husband's income and net worth. He said it was tied to private equity investment funds, but he seems to be insinuating that you personally are tied into this welfare scam. How do you respond to that?",
      "REP. OMAR: Ever since I've gotten to Congress, they have been doing these sort of weird ethics investigations, none of them have yielded anything because I have been as transparent as I can be, and there is nothing wrong with any documentation that I have ever provided to the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for joining us today. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Protests in Iran\u00a0continued in the Islamic Republic, online videos purported to show, despite threats from the country's theocracy to crack down on demonstrators after shutting down the internet and cutting telephone lines off to the world.",
      "An external rights group that relies on information from contacts inside Iran said Saturday that at least 116 people have been killed in the protests, which\u00a0began in Tehran in late December\u00a0as anger over Iran's ailing economy, but quickly spread and morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in years.",
      "The protesters appeared to be taking encouragement from repeated declarations of support by the Trump administration, and by the country's exiled crown prince, who called on them to try and overwhelm security forces and seize towns and cities.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused President Trump of having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" in remarks aired Friday on Iranian state TV, as supporters gathered before him shouted \"Death to America!\"",
      "Protesters are \"ruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\" the 86-year-old Khamenei said to the crowd at his compound in Tehran. \"Because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\"",
      "Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation, without discussing dead demonstrators, whom it increasingly refers to as \"terrorists.\" However, it also acknowledged protests went on into Sunday morning, with demonstrations in Tehran and in the holy city of Mashhad to the northeast.",
      "Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with the Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.",
      "\"Prosecutors must carefully and without delay, by issuing indictments, prepare the grounds for the trial and decisive confrontation with those who, by betraying the nation and creating insecurity, seek foreign domination over the country,\" the statement read. \"Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence.\"",
      "Trump issues fresh warnings to Iran's leaders",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly pledged to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that has taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He issued a message of support to protestors on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "A day earlier, Mr. Trump said that any possible American strike wouldn't \"mean boots on the ground but that means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "\"Iran's in big trouble,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.\"",
      "He added, \"I tell the Iranian leaders you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too.\"",
      "In a brief social media post published in the very early hours of Saturday morning in Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"the United States supports the brave people of Iran.\"",
      "Iranian regime warns protesters will be punished \"without any legal leniency\"",
      "Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \"will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\"",
      "According to the Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which was founded by anti-regime activists, as of Saturday, the 14th day of unrest in Iran, at least 116 people had been killed, including at least 37 members of the security forces. More than 2,600 people had been arrested, and protests were recorded in at least 185 cities.",
      "The agency found that those who were killed died by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.",
      "Iranian authorities shut down the internet on Thursday night as protests escalated sharply, seemingly as people heeded a call by the exiled crown prince, a vocal opposition figure, for Iranians to raise their voices against the regime. Iranian state media has shown only pro-government demonstrations. But the few social media videos that have made it through the internet blockade tell a different story.",
      "According to an update posted online Sunday morning local time by the monitoring organization NetBlocks, stated that the blackout \"is now past the 60 hour mark as national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels. The censorship measure presents a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of Iranians at a key moment for the country's future.\"",
      "That communications blackout has made it incredibly difficult to gain a clear picture of the scale of the protests overall \u2014 and the Iranian authorities' response to it. Some other reports put the death toll from unrest much higher, with TIME citing a doctor in Tehran as saying at least 217 people had been killed, for instance.",
      "Staff at three Iranian hospitals told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed by the number of dead and injured patients.",
      "BBC Persian verified that about 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht Friday night local time, but because the morgue was at full capacity, the bodies had to be taken away.",
      "A hospital worker in Tehran told BBC News there were so many wounded patients brought in that staff did not have time to perform CPR.",
      "Iranian authorities have acknowledged a few deaths, but usually only those of security forces.",
      "A doctor and medic at two hospitals in Iran told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed with injuries. The doctor said a Tehran eye hospital had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital who said the facility did not have enough surgeons to handle the influx of patients. The medic claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes.",
      "Asked by CBS News how seriously he believes Iran's autocratic rulers are taking the warnings from Mr. Trump not to kill protesters, Maziar Bahari, editor of the IranWire news website, said he was certain it had \"really scared many Iranian officials, and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors.\"",
      "\"But at the same time ... it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" said Bahari, who spent months in Iranian prisons after being arrested during a previous round of massive unrest in 2009.",
      "\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" Bahari told CBS News' Haley Ott. \"And we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the movement. But a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution. But we don't have that leader.\"",
      "But while decades of draconian control over the media and the deliberate sidelining of dissident voices in the country have deprived Iran of a clear opposition figurehead inside the country's borders, many in the vast Iranian diaspora hope the nation's ousted royal family could stage a comeback.",
      "Online videos contradict state media",
      "Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.",
      "State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the \"Epic of Khorramshahr\" by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year, honors Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.",
      "Meanwhile, state television reported that \"peace prevailed in most cities of the country\" overnight, with \"no news of any gathering or chaos in Tehran and most provinces.\" That was directly contradicted by an online video verified by the Associated Press that showed demonstrations in Tehran's Saadat Abad area. Thousands gathered in the street, and one man could be heard chanting \"Death to Khamenei!\"",
      "The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and one of the few media outlets able to publish to the outside world, released surveillance camera footage of what it said came from demonstrations in Isfahan. In it, a protester appeared to fire a long gun, while others set fires and threw gasoline bombs at what appeared to be a government compound.",

      "Kurdish fighters were evacuated from a contested neighborhood in Syria's northern city of Aleppo, officials said early Sunday local time, a move that could bring an end to several days of violent clashes with government forces.",
      "State-run news agency SANA reported buses transported the last of the fighters from the Aleppo neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsoud to northeastern Syria, which is under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "\"Through international mediation to halt the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo, we have reached an understanding leading to a ceasefire and the safe evacuation of martyrs, the wounded, trapped civilians, and fighters from the Achrafieh and Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhoods to northern and eastern Syria,\" SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said in a post on X.",
      "He called for \"mediators to uphold their promises to stop the violations and work towards the safe return of the displaced to their homes.\"",
      "An Associated Press journalist at the scene saw buses leaving Sunday and was told by officials that the transports carried 360 fighters. Other buses carrying civilians and detained fighters departed on Saturday.",
      "Syrian security forces deployed Saturday in Sheikh Maqsoud after days of clashes with Kurdish fighters that killed and wounded dozens.",
      "During the day, several drone strikes were reported in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, leading authorities to stop civilian flights at Aleppo International Airport until further notice, state TV said.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, an explosive drone hit the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after two Cabinet ministers and a local official held a news conference on the developments in the city. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Syria's state TV aired footage showing a drone exploding as it slammed into the building and blamed Kurdish fighters for the attack. The SDF denied the reports, saying its fighters did not attack a civilian target.",
      "The fighting between the two sides is the most intense since the fall of then-President Bashar Assad in December 2024. At least 22 people were killed in five days of clashes and more than 140,000 were displaced.",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack held talks in Damascus Saturday with top officials, including President Ahmad al-Sharaa, and called on all parties to cease hostilities and return to dialogue.",
      "\"Violence risks undermining the progress achieved since the fall of the Assad regime and invites external interference that serves no party's interests,\" Barrack said in comments posted on X. \"We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, immediately cease hostilities, and return to dialogue,\" he added, saying that fighting undermines the deal reached in March between the government and the Kurdish leadership.",
      "He said recent developments in Aleppo were \"deeply concerning,\" and Washington's objective \"remains a sovereign, unified Syria \u2014 at peace with itself and its neighbors \u2014 where equality, justice, and opportunity are extended to all its people.\"",
      "Syria's state news agency SANA reported that two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces without inflicting casualties, as gunfire was still heard in the neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsoud around noon Saturday.",
      "From the early hours, Syrian security forces were sweeping the neighborhood after calling on residents to stay home for their own safety.",
      "Hundreds of people who fled the neighborhood days earlier were waiting at Sheikh Maqsoud's entrances to be allowed in once the military operations are over.",
      "Clashes broke out Tuesday in the predominantly Kurdish northern neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh and Bani Zaid, after the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main Kurdish-led force in the country,\u00a0failed to make progress\u00a0on how to merge their forces into the national army. Security forces have since captured Achrafieh and Bani Zaid.",
      "Kurdish forces said at least 12 civilians were killed in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods in the five days of fighting, while government officials reported at least 10 civilians were killed in the surrounding government-controlled areas.",
      "Syria's Information Minister Hamza al-Mustafa told state TV that Kurdish fighters used civilian buildings including hospitals and clinics during the fighting. Each side has accused the other of starting the violence and of deliberately targeting civilian neighborhoods and infrastructure, including ambulance crews and hospitals.",
      "The Kurdish-led Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, which controls much of Syria's northeast, said that security forces targeted Khaled Fajr Hospital in Sheikh Maqsoud, putting the lives of patients and paramedics in danger. It called on the international community to intervene to force government forces to stop shelling.",
      "State TV reported that at least one security member was wounded when a drone fired by the SDF struck the neighborhood.",
      "This also comes as the U.S. on Saturday conducted large-scale strikes against multiple Islamic State targets across Syria. The strikes targeted at least 35 locations.",

NATO allies and Greenland have disagreed with Mr. Trump's assessment.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said, without explaining what that entailed.

      "State media in Iran called the protesters terrorists, while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made a public address\u00a0on Friday, accusing Iranians of ruining their own streets to please the president of the United States. Officials cut off the country's internet\u00a0on Thursday, effectively shutting off Iran from the outside world.",
      "Dagris said Internet access was cut \"because the Islamic Republic didn't want the international community and fellow Iranians to see what was happening.\"",
      "\"I think there's a real worry that with the internet shutdown, the international community won't pay attention and that the events on the ground will deteriorate,\" said Dagres, who grew up in Iran.",
      "She said she was not certain Mr. Trump's warnings would deter a crackdown.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is a regime that's been in power for 47 years and it has not changed its behavior, nor will it because the president of the United States makes a threat,\" Dagres said. \"And we're hearing that and seeing that already with what's been playing out ... This is an Islamic Republic that's backed in the corner, and it's lashing out. And that's just what they do best, unfortunately: Brutal crackdowns.\"",
      "Bahari said that \"many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" but noted that there is no opposition leader to coalesce around.",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former shah, who was overthrown in January 1979, has been encouraging protesters over social media and saying he is preparing to return to the country, but it's unclear how much support he actually has inside Iran.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",

      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",

    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first ever American leader, appears to signal a more inclusive leadership style than his predecessor.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014\u00a0Pope Leo XIV has summoned Catholic cardinals from around the world to the Vatican for a meeting called an \"extraordinary consistory,\" to seek their guidance on the Catholic Church's priorities for the years ahead.",
      "\"I am here to listen,\" Leo, a Chicago native and the first ever pope from the U.S., said Wednesday in his opening remarks. \"This day-and-a-half together will point the way for our path ahead.\"",
      "Of the 245 members of the College of Cardinals, 170 of the so-called \"princes of the church\" were in Vatican City to participate in the gathering.",
      "As it got underway, Leo asked the cardinals to select two of four possible topics for detailed discussions: The missionary nature of the church, further reforms of the Vatican bureaucracy, synodality and liturgy.",
      "A majority chose to prioritize the missionary and synodal themes over the liturgy or Vatican reforms, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. That means the consistory is likely to focus on how to make the church more missionary, and more responsive to the needs of the faithful.",
      "Significantly, the cardinals chose not to discuss liturgy, which would likely have seen them grapple with divisions within the church over the celebration of the traditional Latin Mass, which became a flashpoint after Pope Francis significantly restricted its use.",
      "The Latin Mass \u2014   also known as the Tridentine mass \u2014 is controversial because it represents a form of Catholic worship that some say is out of touch with modern sensibilities. It is celebrated entirely in Latin, with the priest facing the altar and the faithful receiving communion on the tongue while kneeling. Critics argue that it can feel inaccessible and limits parishioners' participation, while supporters say it is a sacred preservation of tradition.",
      "Merely by convening the consistory, Pope Leo's has underscored his commitment to involving the full College of Cardinals in governance of the Catholic Church, which has some 1.4 billion followers worldwide according to the Vatican.",
      "By contrast, during his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis held only one extraordinary consistory, instead relying primarily on a small group of hand-picked advisors to help him plot the church's course \u2014 a practice that left some cardinals feeling sidelined.",
      "Since his election at the papal conclave in May, the American pontiff's tenure has largely been shaped by commitments inherited from Francis, including the major events of the 2025 Holy Year.",
      "By convening the consistory immediately after those Holy Year events, Leo appears to be signaling the unofficial launch of his own pontificate, and charting a course aligned with his priorities.",
      "Leo signalled on Wednesday that his papacy would be progressive, calling the Second Vatican Council \u2014 a landmark gathering in the 1960s known as Vatican II that was seen as a significant move to modernize the Catholic Church \u2014   the \"guiding star\" of the Church's journey under his leadership.",
      "Among other things, Vatican II allowed for mass to be celebrated in local languages, not just the traditional Latin. It also introduced simpler rites and encouraged more participation by active lay people in congregations, and cemented improved relations between Catholics, Jews and people of other faiths, and promoting the church's engagement with the modern world.",

      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians. (realfood.gov)",

      "\"The recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10% of total calories is based on the research showing that higher rates increase LDL cholesterol and associated risks for cardiovascular disease,\" Sherry Coleman Collins, a food allergy dietitian and expert from the Atlanta metropolitan area, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Dr. Pooja Gidwani, a double board-certified doctor of internal medicine and obesity medicine in Los Angeles, pointed out that not everyone has the same \"tolerance\" for saturated fats.",
      "\"If increasing saturated fat leads to a meaningful rise in LDL cholesterol or ApoB (Apolipoprotein B, a protein found on the surface of certain cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood), that intake level is excessive for that individual, regardless of improvements in weight or glucose metrics,\" she said.",

      "Overall, the doctor recommends unsaturated fat sources, including extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado and omega-3-rich fish, as primary dietary fats.",

A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",
      "Here is a practical plan families can actually use.",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",
      "Email is the number one entry point for scams targeting seniors. Strong filtering matters. Use an email provider with advanced spam protection, such as Gmail or Outlook.com. In the email settings:",
      "Turn off automatic image loadingDisable link previewsBlock or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown sendersAutomatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",
      "Turn off automatic image loading",
      "Disable link previews",
      "Block or auto-quarantine attachments from unknown senders",
      "Automatically move messages from unknown senders to a Review folder",
      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "7) Set clear rules around scams and payments",
      "Technology helps, but expectations matter. Have one calm conversation and agree on simple rules:",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or textsNo sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrencyAlways call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "No gift cards for urgent emails or texts",
      "No sending money through unfamiliar apps or cryptocurrency",
      "Always call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "Post these rules near the computer or phone. Visual reminders reduce panic decisions. Also, before setting rules, choose one primary trusted contact. Multiple helpers can slow response during urgent scams and create confusion when fast decisions matter. That person should be the default call for anything urgent involving money, account access, or unexpected requests.",
      "Adult children increasingly step in to help parents spot red flags before a simple mistake turns into a financial loss. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",

      "Your second line of defense",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "4) VPN (Virtual Private Network)",
      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",
      "While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "How companies follow you across apps",
      "Cross-app tracking lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.",
      "On\u00a0iPhone, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.On\u00a0Android, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.",

The Catholic healthcare provider has confirmed a cyberattack discovered last May may have affected nearly 500,000 patients, a sharp increase from the fewer than 8,000 people it initially reported earlier this year.",
      "A ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the incident, though Covenant Health has not publicly confirmed the use of ransomware.

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",

The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",

For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",

      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.",

      "Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, takes over Las Vegas. It's where tech companies show off what they're building next, from products that are almost ready to buy to ideas that feel pulled from the future.",
      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you'll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls. Everything is wrapped in a Ceraluminum ceramic finish that resists fingerprints and scratches while feeling premium in hand.",
      "Availability: Expected early 2026. Pricing has not been announced.",
      "SpotOn focused on precision and reliability with the launch of the SpotOn GPS Fence Nova Edition. This is a GPS dog fence system designed to create virtual fences anywhere, from small yards to massive rural properties, with no subscription required.",
      "What sets Nova apart is its advanced antenna and receiver system. SpotOn uses a dual-band, dual-feed active antenna paired with a dual-band receiver that reduces GPS drift by up to 40% and delivers accuracy up to eight times better than competing systems. In third-party testing, it achieved 100% reliable containment.",
      "Owners can create unlimited fences by walking boundaries, drawing them in the app, or placing GPS fenceposts automatically. The collar also includes intelligent audio cues, optional static correction, custom voice commands, LED prompts and sizing that grows with your dog. If a dog ever leaves the fence, tracking tools are available through the app or SpotOn support.",
      "Availability: Available in the US and Canada for $999.",
      "Lenovo took handheld gaming seriously with the Legion Go powered by SteamOS. This is the most powerful Legion handheld to ship natively with SteamOS, blending desktop-class performance with console-like simplicity.",
      "It features an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display and can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage with expansion via microSD. SteamOS is tuned for gamepad controls and quick access, with features like fast suspend and resume, cloud saves, Steam Chat and built-in game recording.",
      "The result feels less like a mini PC and more like a true console you can carry. You get instant access to your Steam library without juggling operating systems or launchers.",
      "Availability: On sale June 2026. Starting price is $1,199.",
      "SanDisk introduced a new internal drive brand at CES, and the Optimus GX 7100M is its first standout. Built for handheld gaming consoles and thin and light laptops, this PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD delivers speeds up to 7,250 MB per second.",
      "The drive is available in capacities up to 2TB, giving gamers faster load times, more room for large libraries and smoother performance on the go. It is designed for devices that support an M.2 2230 slot, including popular handheld consoles and compact laptops.",
      "This launch also marks the debut of the SanDisk Optimus name, which will replace the company's internal SSD lineup for gamers, creators and professionals moving forward.",
      "Availability: Expected early spring 2026. Pricing will be announced closer to release.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CES 2026 made one thing clear. Tech companies are taking bigger swings than ever. Some of these products feel close to becoming part of everyday life. Others may stay experimental for years. That's what makes CES so fascinating. It gives us an early look at where technology could be headed and sparks conversations about what we actually want in our homes, cars and daily routines.",

      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Google phishing emails looked like routine workplace alerts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.",

    "summary": "Researchers create supercapacitors from waste PET plastic bottles that could power electric vehicles and electronics within 5 to 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",

      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",

      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine.

      "Researchers, however, uncovered a long-running malware operation that abused that trust on a massive scale. Koi Security analysts identified the threat while analyzing suspicious infrastructure tied to a campaign known as ShadyPanda. What started as one investigation quickly revealed something far larger.",
      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Analysts uncovered a coordinated campaign that hid spyware inside everyday browser tools like new tab pages and translators. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",
      "When in doubt, trust your instincts. Browsers should not surprise you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "DarkSpectre is a reminder that online threats are getting smarter and quieter. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser. Paying attention, cleaning house now and then, and questioning what you install can make a real difference.",

      "Following the ouster of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3 after he and his wife were whisked away to face justice in New York, ordinary citizens of Venezuela are responding with a mix of relief, shock and uncertainty after 30 years of a brutal socialist dictatorship that bankrupted their nation.",
      "While what happens next remains largely uncertain and multiple possibilities continue to be studied by Washington, the celebratory tones seen across the country and throughout the almost 9 million citizens in the diaspora on Saturday have largely subsided into muted and cautious joy only expressed in private circles among those who longed for an end to years of economic hardship and political repression.",
      "Vera, a professor at one of the better-known universities, told Fox News Digital, \"The world cannot fathom the joy we feel. Maduro is in a federal prison in the U.S. with living conditions and rights that our political prisoners never had. For me, it is comforting to know he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life behind bars eating rice and sausage and taking showers only three times a week, paying for damaging the lives of millions of Venezuelans.\"",

      "Yet fear remains. The government has decreed any celebration of current events \u2014 and even expressions of approval of the U.S. operation in written text messages \u2014 to be a crime equivalent to national treason. Worse yet: it has empowered any law officer to check citizens and their telephones at random at hundreds of checkpoints established throughout Caracas and other regions of the country.",
      "Anyone found in violation of the decree can be immediately arrested without a trial, turning the promise of change into an anxiety-tempered state about what comes next and raising questions about sovereignty, daily survival and how to overcome yet another crisis.",
      "For Jes\u00fas, a 23-year-old university student from a middle-class family in Caracas who also works for a local business, a single word defines this past week: stress. For safety reasons, he and other Venezuelans interviewed for this story requested either partial or complete anonymity due to the security situation.",

      "\"There are police cars and officers from the national, municipal and local authorities stationed in every corner. Hundreds of checkpoints have sprung up across Caracas since the decree forbidding any celebratory expression at the U.S. operation that captured Maduro. At the first few days, there were also pro-government publicly armed colectivos (state-sanctioned citizen collectivities) doing the rounds to capture and violently repress anyone so much as expressing relief that Maduro was gone. It\u2019s been extremely difficult having to remain vigilant at all times. From prior experiences, I learned to avoid most checkpoints through alternate ways and avoiding main roads. People have been sending texts saying where the checkpoints are and telling us to delete anything that shows our support for U.S. actions from our phones.\"",
      "He continued, \"For me, personally, it\u2019s a time of mixed feelings. I am relieved to see Maduro gone and finally see a promise or discourse by either local or foreign governments to come to pass in Venezuela. While I obviously understand this only happened because of foreign interference, I much prefer a U.S. action that ends this dictatorship than preserving Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty at the cost of our country. On the other hand, I am also frightened, because once you start dismantling the established structures, you end up having chaos, and in such a case, the population suffers the most.\"",
      "Jes\u00fas adds that he transits through three main large groups of people \u2014 his student friends, his family and older relatives and his job. He adds that among his friends the mood is largely of hope that the U.S. might reshape the Venezuelan market and develop it into what he calls a \"developed\" system, where people can actually lead a better life. \"We\u2019ll finally stop being a Cuban colony and either be truly independent or a U.S.-.led country like the Dominican Republic. Nothing wrong with that. We\u2019ll still be better off and more stable,\" he added.",

      "\"Finally, at work, there is apathy. I work in a rich neighborhood where lots of government officers and military people frequent. Obviously, police officers and other government officials who benefited from the corruption and criminality are against what happened, but most military personnel say they won\u2019t die for something they didn\u2019t sign up for because of a dictatorship. At my work, we\u2019ve seen so many broken promises, that we are only bracing to stay afloat,\" he concluded.",
      "For Hannah, a recent graduate, there\u2019s relief that Maduro is gone. \"Obviously, things shouldn\u2019t be like this, and Venezuelans should be the ones deciding the future of their own country, but Maduro had to leave one way or another, and now he is gone,\" she adds.",

      "\"In the more pragmatic business elite in Venezuela, there is a lot of hope that a more normal business environment will be created now that Maduro is gone and if the U.S. plays the regime-change and economy-development cards right, even if it is to favor themselves foremost. But even then, this would be a better environment for private businesses and an enormous market ripe for renovated activity. In that sense, most people are hopeful that Maduro is finally gone, but obviously it\u2019s hard to see your own country being attacked by a foreign power,\" he says.",

I do have my personal reservations regarding Trump and the U.S., as there is evidently an economic interest on their part. We have one of the largest extra-heavy oil reserves in the world, on top of our reserves of gas, gold and coltan.\"",
      "She continued, \"The U.S. actions are not free, and we still need to see what the actual costs \u2014 which could be very high \u2014 will be. I am very sorry that this happened in my country and would be lying if I said I agreed with foreign incursions, but I am also of the opinion that our own Armed Forces should have listened to the majority of the citizens in the 2024 elections [when Maduro retained power despite losing the vote], but they chose to continue oppressing their own people. This is, therefore, part of the cost we should pay for their inoperancy,\" she said.",
      "Vera cautions that reactivating Venezuela\u2019s economic growth will be a medium- to-long-term task, but that when the feeling of political change is real, everything flows better, and the feeling of opportunity in the country is real right now.",

And the Eagles\u2019 season-long issue proved to be costly in the defeat, namely, their pedestrian offense.",

      "The game was hard-fought enough that Philadelphia still had a chance to take the lead late in the fourth quarter. After San Francisco scored the go-ahead touchdown, quarterback Jalen Hurts and the offense had two minutes and 54 seconds to come up with their own go-ahead score. But drops by A.J.

      "Even as Philadelphia managed to win 11 games this season, there were concerns from the fan base over the direction of the offense under new coordinator Kevin Patullo. The team finished 19th in the NFL in points per game, 24th in yards per game and 22nd in yards per play.",
      "Hurts himself even alluded to frustrations with Patullo when he was asked in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s game about why he wasn\u2019t running the ball more often.",

    "story": [
      "Renters in the U.S. found some relief in 2025 as a surge of newly finished apartments in many parts of the country led to cheaper rent.",
      "It\u2019s a trend that could reverse in 2026.",
      "Data released Friday shows the construction of new apartments has dropped off in the last year, spelling potential trouble for renters as the number of available properties stagnates and macroeconomic pressures keep more people in the rental market.",
      "It\u2019s a shift that experts say could indicate the start of a challenging cycle for renters.",
      "\u201cFewer housing projects are being started and fewer are being completed, which goes to show that the pandemic building boom is over,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist for real estate brokerage Redfin. \u201cThis will limit inventory of both homes for sale and rent moving forward, which will exacerbate the housing shortage.\u201d",
      "According to October data released Friday from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, two major indicators of residential apartment construction activity saw a year-over-year decline.",
      "Starts, which measures the launch of construction, saw a nearly 11% drop in activity compared to October 2024. This means there are fewer apartments being built now than in the year prior.",
      "Another important indicator is the number of completed builds. October data shows completions declined nearly 42% compared to the year prior, meaning there are fewer newly constructed apartments ready to enter the market now than there were in 2024.",
      "However, the data also showed a pickup in permits authorizing new apartment construction \u2014 meaning builders have new projects lined up.",
      "It can take more than a year and a half to get a building completed once a permit is issued, according to Robert Dietz, the National Association of Home Builders\u2019 chief economist. So although there is an uptick in permits for new construction, that is unlikely to immediately translate into a jump in completed projects in 2026.",
      "Following a huge boom in completed projects in 2024, the data shows, homebuilders didn\u2019t push forward on as many new projects in 2025. While there is still a surplus of supply and builders are gearing up to start new builds, the decline in starts and completions means there will likely be fewer new builds hitting the market in 2026.",
      "Part of this decline in construction activity can be attributed to the financial strain homebuilders have been feeling from higher interest rates, wages, fees and material costs, which in turn makes building more expensive, both experts said. However, this was mainly a barrier for larger metropolitan rental markets that are more heavily populated.",
      "Due to lower construction costs and zoning laws, construction actually increased in smaller towns and secondary cities in less dense areas of the country \u2014 like the Sunbelt and the Midwest, according to Dietz and Fairweather.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to build in those areas, [but] it may be the last leg of some of the work from home,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cIn fact, as work from home has been replaced with return to the office, we\u2019re likely to see rental demand increase in the inner suburbs and the central counties just due to commuting costs.\u201d",
      "Many of these areas saw a decline in rental costs, too.",
      "According to Realtor.com data for November, the national average rent across the 50 biggest metropolitan areas in the U.S. dropped 1% from the year prior.",
      "Metro areas like Austin, Texas, and Denver saw some of the bigger rent cuts, while denser metro regions \u2014 like New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco \u2014 either saw no change or some rent growth, according to the data.",
      "For renters in some of these denser areas, competition might be steeper this coming year, Fairweather noted.",
      "Overall, she said she thinks there will be \u201cmore demand for apartments,\u201d which in turn will \u201cput some pressure on prices because supply is likely not going to improve.\u201d",
      "Also contributing to this increase in competition is the fact that fewer people are buying homes due to high costs, keeping them on the rental market, Fairweather said in an article she co-authored detailing Redfin\u2019s 2026 housing predictions.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Dietz said the \u201chousing affordability crisis manifests itself both in terms of frustrated prospective homebuyers who rent longer as well as households who do not form, which means young adults living with their parents and then also doubling and tripling up with roommates.\u201d",
      "Fairweather echoed this view, saying she expects \u201cmore intergenerational living arrangements or roommate living arrangements.\u201d",
      "While the 2024 surge has left some inventory still on the market, and the increase in permits means there will be more construction down the road, in the meantime, renters could be left with a gap in new supply once the available units run out \u2014 pushing them to cough up more cash in more competitive rental markets, or come up with alternative living arrangements.",
      "And looking ahead, Dietz said he expects apartment construction to be \u201crelatively flat\u201d in 2026."

      "The film is a romantic romp, with settings like Barcelona, Tuscany, New Orleans and the woods of Canada, set to a soundtrack consisting of Robyn, Taylor Swift and Paula Abdul. And it hits all the romantic comedy beats: a hilarious miscommunication between Alex and Poppy's dad (played by Alan Ruck), a steamy kiss on a balcony in the pouring rain (the actors say it was actually freezing) and a sprint to profess one's love (through an Ohio neighborhood, rather than an airport).",
      "The book was first published in May 2021, marking the second in Henry's meteoric run of romantic comedies. She published six books in five years \u2014 \"Beach Read\" (2020), \"People We Meet on Vacation\" (2021), \"Book Lovers\" (2022), \"Happy Place\" (2023), \"Funny Story\" (2024), \"A Great Big Beautiful Life\" (2025) \u2014 almost all of which are currently optioned for screen adaptations.

      "Emily Bader: About two people who don't meet on vacation?",

I think it's about these two people meeting new versions of each other again and again and again over time, and falling in love with each other again and again, and more and more. So it's like (gesturing between them) these are the people we meet on vacation.",
      "EB: We meet different versions of ourselves. That's it. Canon now.",

Like if we're talking \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" (she's) more Billy Crystal. And I think that's really fun. She's very carefree and takes up all the space that she wants to, which I think is an exciting new interpretation.",
      "TB: I think for Alex, his unique spin is the \"Vacation Alex\" aspect, which is him slowly coming out of his shell because of this person who gives him the power to express himself \u2014\u00a0epitomized by him stripping off and running into the sea.",

      "EB: I think it's so amazing that we got to be a part of the first one. I do think that it's going to be a very long journey for her. Advice? Have fun. They're amazing people. Emily Henry's not only a genius, but a very wonderful human.",

      "EB: I think for Poppy, her music taste is also sort of seen in the way that she dresses. She's someone who reacts really strongly to something that she loves, and once she loves it, it's hers forever, even if it makes absolutely no sense in her closet or her catalog of music. And I love that about her. She just, she likes what she likes, and it's all over the map.",
      "TB: The soundtrack's amazing. (Director) Brett Haley is a musical genius. He picks songs like nobody else. I think it's going to go down in history as a great movie soundtrack.",
      "For Alex, I think the musical side of him that we didn't see, I've seen him described as a black cat boyfriend. Instead of like a golden retriever, he's more of a black cat. And so I think it's like The Smiths. \"500 Days of Summer\" kind of vibes.",
      "EB: Oh, he is such a \"500 Days of Summer\" guy. And absolutely no jazz, apparently.",
      "TB: But he's got moves."

Later in the turret that night, the three learn about the Secret Traitor (who wears a special red cloak) and their power. Every week, the Secret Traitor creates a shortlist of players to be murdered until all the Traitors have the chance to team up.",
      "The first mission requires the cast to divide into groups of three and find coffins marked with dollar signs in a loch. The coffins are then placed in one of the player\u2019s graves, meaning they are at risk for murder. At the end, nine players are on the chopping block.",
      "Back at the mansion, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams confronts actor Michael Rapaport after hearing from Dillard Bassett that he wanted to target all the housewives. But Dillard Bassett says that Williams misheard her, leading to more confusion. Cumming announces at the end of the episode to the audience that the Secret Traitor chose four out of the nine at risk players to be on the shortlist for murder. The three Traitors receive a letter from the Secret Traitor with the four names: Rausch, Ian Terry from \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Mark Ballas from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and singer-songwriter Eric Nam.",
      "Episode 2",
      "The episode opens with \u201cThe Traitors\u201d tradition of having each player arrive for breakfast except one. Viewers discover that the Traitors chose to murder Ian Terry. In his final confessional, a disappointed Terry says, \u201cI had a feeling that was going to be the case. I just don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done differently. But, you know what, this is the biggest backhanded compliment in this game.\u201d",
      "Before the players depart for the second mission, Williams slips up again by accidentally saying that she \u201ckilled\u201d Terry, causing comedian Ron Funches\u2019 ears to perk up. At the mission, more drama unfolds, this time between \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Yamil \u201cYam Yam\u201d Arocho and \u201cLove Island\u201d UK star Maura Higgins. The players have to transport three players on a throne back to the castle. Along the way, they have to make multiple stops and collect gold or shields. The last players on the throne when they reach the castle will be safe from murder. Arocho takes Higgins' spot on the throne, securing his safety for the night, and Rapaport inserts himself in the conversation by claiming that he also needed a shield. He continues to call out Arocho in front of everyone when they return to the mansion. Meanwhile, Williams errs again by mentioning that there are four Traitors, adding to the list of evidence Funches is compiling.",
      "At the first Round Table, \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Natalie Anderson kicks things off by explaining why she thinks Donna \u201cMama\u201d Kelce is a Traitor. But Funches\u2019 theory about Williams is more compelling. It is a close vote, but Williams receives one more vote than Kelce and is banished. While standing on the Circle of Truth, Williams says, \u201cI came in and I tried to fight for the housewives and it almost started to feel like I\u2019m going to be the one who is going to help to lead us to find a Traitor the first time. I am a Faithful.\u201d The group is stunned and Funches says in his confessional that he feels like he put a target on his back.",
      "Toward the end of Episode 2, the Traitors are tasked with completing a covert murder in plain sight. The Traitors must find a set of tarot cards hidden in the kitchen that reveal the second shortlist from the Secret Traitor. Next, they have to take the card of the person they want to murder and burn it in the fireplace in the breakfast room. If successful, they can meet the Secret Traitor and unite. If unsuccessful, there will not be a murder that night and they will not have any control over the next murder.",
      "Rausch spots the red reaper painting in the kitchen and instantly knows that is where the tarot cards are hidden. Meanwhile, Dillard Bassett starts a Conga line to distract the rest of the players. But \u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob Cesternino isn\u2019t fooled. He tells \u201cBig Brother\u201d alum Tiffany Mitchell that he suspects a murder is happening in plain sight and she needs to stay alert. He also shares this theory with Dillard Bassett and Ballas.",
      "Rausch takes the tarot cards to Rinna and they discuss the shortlist: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d star Mon\u00e9t X Change, Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish and Cesternino. The two Traitors slip away to the breakfast room, without having time to consult with Dillard Bassett, and burn one card, murdering a player.",
      "Episode 3",
      "All the players safely arrive to breakfast the next morning except one: Cesternino. We see a flashback where he learned his fate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they got me. I leave with no regrets. Traitors, I\u2019ll get you next time,\u201d he says.",
      "Rapaport abruptly starts targeting Arocho again about the shield from the last mission, rubbing multiple players the wrong way. Cumming arrives and shocks the players by sharing that there will be a morning Round Table meeting and banishment. Many of the players meet and agree that they will vote for Kelce to be banished. Kelce attempts to defend herself and suggests that Rapaport is a Traitor.",
      "But the players stand firm on their decision to banish her. They all vote to remove her from the game except Rapaport, who voted for Arocho, and Kelce, who voted for Rapaport.",
      "While standing on the Circle of Truth, Kelce says, \u201cI know I\u2019m the sacrificial lamb and I know that I had a blast meeting every single one of you. On that note, I think I\u2019m going to go \u2026 but you got yourself a Traitor!\u201d",
      "Kelce is then revealed as the Secret Traitor who was chosen by Cumming when they first arrived. The episode \u201crewinds\u201d to show the moments she met in secret with Cumming and planned her shortlists. Kelce says in her confessional that her strategy was to be a lovable mom figure during the day and a \u201cdevious Traitor at night.\u201d She says that she targeted players with her shortlists who were laying low and not speaking up.",
      "Reflecting on her game, she says, \u201cPlaying a Traitor was tough but I gave it my best shot. This has been a dream come true.\u201d Getting emotional, she adds, \u201cThese are happy tears that I get to do this at this point in my life. It\u2019s just the joy of being in the game.\u201d",
      "Cumming asks each player to pair up with the person they trust most. Funches is the odd person out, so he will be automatically shortlisted for murder. The duos select one person to be put in a cage and another to hunt for skulls and stack them in a tower. Kish, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star Caroline Stanbury, Rinna and Nam\u2019s partners are all unsuccessful which means they are at risk.",
      "The at-risk players are left behind and tied to trees where they wait to find out if they will be murdered by the Traitors face to face. After making their decision in the turret, the Traitors go to the woods and meet with each player. Nam pleads for his life in the game. Kish says she won\u2019t beg. Stanbury says she isn\u2019t ready to go and Funches threatens the Traitors.",
      "He says if they don\u2019t kill him now they will regret it later. \u201cShow me your faces!\u201d he shouts as the episode ends.",
      "Episodes 4 and 5 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d Season 4 will stream on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET."

      "For one night, musicians \u201cunited under tragedy\u201d to commemorate one year since the Eaton Fire forever changed the Altadena, California, community.",
      "A Concert for Altadena, held on Jan. 7 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, was an emotional and uplifting night presented by the band Dawes.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2025, a fire blazed through the Eaton canyon, making its way towards the mountain town of Altadena. On the far west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire was also blazing and wreaking havoc. A total of 31 people died and the fires destroyed about 13,000 homes and residential properties, leaving thousands displaced.",
      "To pay tribute to the lives, homes and businesses lost, the one-night benefit concert brought the Altadena community together in hopes of raising money for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. The organization helps provide resources and options for people who want to stay and rebuild in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe were all affected in different ways. Every person in Altadena was affected at once, but everyone\u2019s stories are unique and different,\u201d co-producer and co-organizer Kevin Lyman, the creator of Warped Tour and longtime Altadena resident, tells TODAY.com. \u201c(We are) united under one tragedy.\u201d",
      "Approached by Dawes and guitarist Eric Krasno, Lyman teamed up with the two and began producing a show to support the community, raise funds and provide 250 tickets to Altadena residents directly impacted by the fire.",
      "The support was immediate. Everyone who helped with the production, Lyman says, were friends who became \u201cextended family.\u201d The participants also had ties to Altadena, Palisades or Los Angeles and were impacted by the fires.",
      "\u201cI think in Altadena now, we\u2019re all an extended family,\u201d Lyman says, before noting the similarities between rebuilding the town and producing a show for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge undertaking that if you look at it as a whole, it\u2019s overwhelming... And all we want to do is bring people together.\u201d",
      "Hosted by actor and Altadena resident John C. Reilly, taking the stage during the over three-hour event was Taboo from Black Eyed Peas, who performed \u201cStand Strong,\u201d his song with his daughter Jett Gomez. Jenny Lewis, Ozomatli, Everclear, Aloe Blacc, Rufus Wainwright, Lord Huron, Judith Hill and Lucius were also part of the line up.",
      "Mandy Moore performed her early hit single \u201cCandy\u201d alongside husband Taylor Goldsmith, singer and guitarist of Dawes. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star and her family\u2019s home was impacted by the fire, with her in-laws and family losing their houses.",
      "Earlier in the day, Moore had expressed how grateful she was to give back to her town after so much \u201ctrauma and grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart is with everyone affected: the lives that were lost and the lives that were forever changed on both sides of our beautiful city,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, in part. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the chance to gather tonight and celebrate how resilient Altadena is; to be in community with one another and MUSIC to commemorate what we\u2019ve lived through and what comes next. I am endlessly grateful to those near and far who supported Los Angeles in our time of need. The work has only just begun but we\u2019re in it together. Altadena forever.\u201d",
      "Brad Paisley played guitar with several artists and performed his song with Dawes, \u201cRaining Inside.\u201d Brandon Flowers from The Killers also helped close out the show before Dawes concluded the event with all their friends.",
      "Speakers from Habitat For Humanity, as well as Altadena Girls, also participated in the event, expressing uplifting words and preaching \u201cAltadena Strong.\u201d Students from Pasadena Waldorf School, which is permanently closed after being damaged by the fire, attended, too.",
      "With rebuilding efforts slowly happening, and only about 10 homes rebuilt so far, according to The Associated Press, the event was able to raise more than $450,000 for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. There is still an online auction happening through Feb. 21.",
      "\u201cI walk out of my house and I start hearing hammers and I hear saws and I hear trucks coming... (It\u2019s) the sound of rebuilding. That\u2019s how you build a song, one note at a time,\u201d Lyman tells TODAY.com. \u201cThen it becomes, hopefully, something people love \u2014 and that\u2019s what Altadena will become again. It\u2019s going to change... It never will be (the same), but that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

      "After \"High School Musical\" star Ashley Tisdale penned a scathing first-person essay for The Cut about her \"toxic\" mom group, celebrities have been responding. And they are not, in fact, all in this together.",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote how she was initially energized by joining a mom group of friends who happened to be having babies at the same time. Eventually, however, she began to feel left out.",
      "Though Tisdale didn\u2019t name names \u2014 and in fact her rep denied that certain celebrities were part of the clique \u2014 there has been a huge amount of internet speculation about the identity of the other moms in the group.",
      "Meghan Trainor, who has been pegged by internet sleuths as a potential member of Tisdale's former mom crew, shared what seemed like a response to the drama on TikTok on Jan. 8.",
      "The video features an expressionless Trainor typing on a keyboard. The text reads, \"Me finding out about the apparent mom group drama.\" Playing in the background is Trainor's song, \"Still Don't Care,\" highlighting these lyrics: \"Let me take a moment, think it over. Does it touch me at all? Nope, I still don\u2019t care.\"",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote, \u201cTo be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people. (Maybe one.) But I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive \u2014 for me, anyway.\u201d",
      "She texted the group that she was leaving because it was getting \u201ctoo high school\u201d for her.",
      "Tisdale, 40, who goes by her married name of Ashley French on her blog, is a mother of two who rose to fame as a child actor in the 2000s on the Disney Channel. Never one to hold back, Tisdale has been outspoken about her personal struggles with mental health, alopecia and breastfeeding.",
      "Responses have been rolling in from other celebrities.",
      "On Jan. 6, Matthew Koma, Hilary Duff's husband, posted a fictional image on his Instagram stories.",
      "The photo looks almost exactly like Tisdale's photo from The Cut: Koma is wearing an almost identical outfit, sitting on a similar-looking off-white couch and striking the same unique pose. The Cut's logo appears in the corner, and the text reads, \"A Mom Group Tell All Through a Father's Eyes: When You're the Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.\"",
      "He also included the text: \u201cRead my new interview with @thecut.\u201d",
      "Another Disney Channel star, Christy Carlson Romano, also shared her feelings about mom groups on Instagram on Jan. 6.",
      "Moms of older kids sometimes end up \"cycling out of those friendships, and that kind of sucks,\" Romano said. When the dynamic shifts, moms often find a new group of friends.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be dramatic, but I get it. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and then you write an article about it,\" Romano concludes with a pointed glance at the camera.",
      "Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, shared a cryptic  Instagram message in his stories: \"Underrated life skill: Pausing to decide if it's worth your energy.\" The image was originally posted by @heycoryallen.",
      "Will this mom group rift have an ending worthy of a Disney Channel original movie? Or will the division continue to play out on social media?",
      "As one commenter on Romano's reel wrote, \"These Disney Channel mom group wars were not on my bingo card for 2026.\""

Her death immediately raises questions, especially when it\u2019s revealed that Jack had been having an affair with Rachel the night before she was killed. As Anna pushes to cover the case as a field reporter and Jack leads the investigation, both find themselves under suspicion, locked in a tense game of truth-telling and omission.",

      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening as it approached Washington, D.C., Trump said he\u2019s receiving hourly reports on violence against protesters. The president said a meeting with Iran's leadership was in the works after officials from the country \"called to negotiate\" on Saturday.",
      "\"The leaders of Iran, they want to negotiate,\" Trump said. \"I think they\u2019re tired of being beat up by the United States. Iran wants to negotiate with us.\"",

      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said Sunday that at least 544 people have been killed. The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights also cited unverified reports that several hundred people may have been killed.",
      "An internet blackout in Iran has made it difficult for journalists and human rights groups to independently verify reports from inside the country.",

Addressing its leaders Friday, he said: \u201cYou better not start shooting, because we\u2019ll start shooting, too.\u201d He offered further support for the protesters Saturday, saying on Truth Social: \u201cIran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before.

      "The Iranian government has not released data on how many protesters have been detained, but the Human Rights Activists News Agency advocacy group reports at least 10,681 people have been arrested during the protests, which it said have spanned 585 locations in 186 cities around the country's 31 provinces.",
      "Iran\u2019s Prosecutor-General Mohammad Movahedi Azad said Saturday that protesters would be considered an \u201cenemy of God,\u201d a death-penalty charge in Iran, in remarks reported by Iranian media. The country\u2019s chief justice said Sunday that there would be \u201cno leniency\u201d toward those involved in the unrest and that judges have been designated to deal with cases across the country, according to state media.",
      "Internet blackouts in Iran continued into Sunday, according to NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group. Amnesty International has called the blackouts an attempt by authorities \u201cto hide the true extent of the grave human rights violations and crimes under international law they are carrying out to crush nationwide protests.\u201d",
      "Security forces sent text messages to people suspected of attending \u201cillegal gatherings,\u201d Iranian state media said Saturday, warning them they have been identified as participants using location data and that covering their faces with masks won\u2019t help avoid detection.",

      "Another verified video showed hundreds of protesters gathered in Tehran\u2019s Ponak Square, chanting, playing music and waving their phone flashlights in the air. Other footage showed scores had also gathered in the city\u2019s Heravi Square, singing and clapping their hands as they marched through the streets.",

      "Solidarity protests took place in France, Germany and the United Kingdom as many Iranians living in Europe offered their support to their compatriots inside Iran. Michael Mohkam, a 78-year-old Iranian living in France, said he hoped for change so that expatriates could one day return home.",

      "That assessment factored in President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Maria Corina Machado, the exiled opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as the best person to take over running the country, sources told NBC News.",
      "These developments were a gut-punch for Michelle, a resident of Caracas.",
      "\u201cFor many years I wished for my country\u2019s government to change, and I thought that when that day came I would feel very happy. But that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said the 34-year-old architect, who moved back to Venezuela last year. \u201cSomehow we will have to pay: either with oil or with our own dignity and sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Michelle and others who spoke to NBC News in Venezuela asked not to be fully identified out of fear the government would punish them.",
      "\u201cA dangerous precedent is being created between the United States and Latin America,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe realize that we are just another piece on the board in the struggle between powers, for whom the future of the Venezuelan people lacks relevance compared to the importance of valuable resources, which are worth more than life itself.\u201d",

      "Trump has repeatedly referred to his desire for Venezuela, which sits on the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, to open its market to American companies. On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn\u2019t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",
      "In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodr\u00edguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez. On her right is Diosdado Cabello, who as minister of the interior minister, justice and peace oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the \u201ccolectivos\u201d that have struck fear among many Venezuelans. Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",
      "The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is \u201cin charge\u201d in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,\u201d James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to go round them up, and they\u2019ve already rounded up some people. If they\u2019re doing that, then we don\u2019t run the country,\u201d said Story, who served as ambassador from 2018 to 2023.",
      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, drew a hard line in a fiery speech on Friday and said that the Islamic Republic would not back down in the face of internal protests or external pressure, a position that will likely drive the security forces to lash out even more violently against demonstrators, analysts say.",

      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",

      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "The UNFCCC created the underlying structure that the Paris Agreement later built upon. It was established in 1992 to inventory and begin to address the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. President George Bush signed the treaty after the Senate delivered its consent in a two-thirds vote.",
      "If the U.S. completes its exit from the UNFCCC \u2014 a process that takes a year \u2014 it would be the first country ever to do so. Re-entering the UNFCCC treaty would require a new two-thirds vote from the Senate, so Trump\u2019s withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",
      "Withdrawing from the UNFCCC would also leave the U.S. as one of the only nations without representation at international climate talks. Already, the White House declined to send an official delegation to the latest U.N. climate summit, COP30, in Brazil last fall.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at all these conventions and the history of participation, even when countries were not really actively engaged in negotiations, it\u2019s pretty astonishing to walk away from the table and have decisions taken without your input,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who has contributed to several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations have not always been enthusiastic participants in international climate discussions, Ebi added, but they still kept tabs on them.",
      "\u201cPeople showed up, sat in the back and did crossword puzzles and never said a word, but they wanted to hear what the discussions were,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cit\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has expressed open hostility for the UNFCCC and other international organizations. In a statement on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them \u201canti-American, useless or wasteful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will officially exit the Paris Agreement on Jan. 27 \u2014 roughly a year after the Trump administration initiated the nation\u2019s exit from the deal.",
      "However, legal questions remain as to whether Trump has the power to exit the UNFCCC without Congress\u2019 consent.",
      "Jean Su, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who directs its energy justice program, said her organization views the move as illegal.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution has articulated what it takes to get into a treaty, which is two-thirds of the Senate majority, but it is actually silent on what it takes to leave a treaty,\u201d Su said. \u201cThere has not been affirmative case law either way as to whether a president can unilaterally pull out of a treaty that was approved by two-thirds of the Senate. So we are looking at legal action.\u201d",
      "The UNFCCC is the world\u2019s facilitator of global climate negotiations. Each year, a host country organizes a Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all participating nations meet to discuss things like emission targets and how to fund climate action globally. Last year\u2019s meeting focused, in part, on the Amazon rainforest and how to address deforestation and climate effects there. The UNFCCC secretariat helps organize these events, creating a structure and facilitating the meetings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like hosting the Olympics \u2014 you don\u2019t do that without the organization to help,\u201d Ebi said.",
      "When the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, it created a budget hole for the UNFCCC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity organization of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, stepped in to fill that gap and keep the secretariat operating.",
      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meanwhile, is an independent body designed to provide policymakers with the best science about climate change, its effects and how it could be addressed. This organization\u2019s reports form the scientific understanding for UNFCCC discussions and treaties.",
      "In a statement, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, said Trump\u2019s exit \u201cwill leave the US less secure and less prosperous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Throughout his first year in office, Trump has made climate programs a target of dramatic budget cuts. He has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and the administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. It is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist, said Wednesday on X that the Trump administration has been \u201cturning its back on the climate crisis since day one,\u201d accusing it of catering to the interests of the oil industry while \u201cendangering people in America and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump Administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science, and sowing distrust around the world,\u201d Gore said."

      "The U.S. seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker threatened new pressure on the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that has helped prop up President Vladimir Putin\u2019s economy.",
      "The American operation to take over the Bella 1 in the North Atlantic after a high-seas chase that began off Venezuela was \u201ca gross violation\u201d of maritime law, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. It expressed \u201cregret and concern\u201d over Washington\u2019s \u201creadiness to generate acute international crisis situations.\u201d",
      "The saga has highlighted the mixed response in the country to the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "While Moscow officially condemned the attack, its messaging has been restrained.",
      "Russia may be reluctant to anger Trump at a precarious moment for the Ukraine peace talks, especially as his approach to Venezuela appears to validate its view of the world as divided into great-power spheres of influence. And despite the complications for the Kremlin and its war effort, some influential voices have expressed jealousy at the effectiveness of the American operation.",
      "Out of the shadows",
      "After a weekslong chase across the Atlantic, the U.S. took over the Bella 1 on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings.",
      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."
