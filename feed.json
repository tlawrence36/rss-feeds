      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Oct 24, 10:52 AM",
      "Additional arrests may follow as the investigation continues.",
      "The more than 100 investigators that Beccuau said are assigned to the case are combing through 150 DNA samples, surveillance footage and evidence left behind in the thieves\u2019 wake.",
      "Those assigned include the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry, the special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts.",
      "Recovering the jewels could be among the most difficult parts of investigators' work. French authorities have added the jewels to Interpol\u2019s Stolen Works of Art Database, a global repository of about 57,000 missing cultural items.",
      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",
      "But don\u2019t expect a flood of updates. Indictments and verdicts are not routinely made public in France. French trials are not televised, and journalists are not allowed to film or photograph anything inside the courtroom during a trial.",

      "FIFA has started selling another million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup",
      "FIFA began the process of selling another 1 million tickets for next year\u2019s World Cup on Monday, with the opening of a new ticket draw marking the start of the tournament\u2019s second phase of sales.",
      "This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.",
      "The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.",
      "\u201cWe already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.\u201d",
      "Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.",
      "Residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order \u2014 purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.",
      "Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.",
      "FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year\u2019s World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.",

An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina \u2014 featuring Lionel Messi \u2014 and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.",
      "Based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches for the tournament around 16 North American venues. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public.",
      "Ticket data has shown that the lowest-priced seats \u2014 set at $60 \u2014 were available for at least 40 matches. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.",
      "Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer\u2019s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.",

      "June Lockhart, beloved for her roles in \u201cLassie\u201d and \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died at 100",
      "LOS ANGELES -- June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \u201cLassie\u201d or up in the stratosphere in \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died. She was 100.",
      "Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.",
      "\u201cShe was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\u201d",
      "The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.",
      "From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \u201cLassie.\u201d From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",
      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays \u201cSteel Magnolias,\u201d \u201cBedroom Farce\u201d and \u201cOnce More with Feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer true passion was journalism,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cShe loved going to the White House briefing rooms.\u201d",
      "Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta.",
      "Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him.",
      "Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children\u2019s ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents.",
      "She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.",
      "Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with \u201cLassie.\u201d",
      "Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: \u201cHow wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known. Many actors work all their lives and never have one part that is really theirs.\u201d",

      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks.

He truly would play seven days a week if he could. And to see him just going, \u201cI\u2019m here, I am here, I\u2019m not going anywhere else,\u201d it\u2019s unbelievable.",
      "BON JOVI: Well, the thing about the \u201cForever\u201d album is that we were very proud of it, and it was coinciding with the documentary and the 40th anniversary. When I wasn\u2019t up to it physically, I thought we could reimagine the record by having features on it. In this day and age, people know what features are. I learned about that the hard way. But in doing so, I think they took a great record and made it better. And, you know, I called Robbie Williams. He was the first call I made. He said yes, which made it easier for me to call number two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, 10. Because at first, it\u2019s daunting. You call even your dear friends and go, \u201cHey, would you do this for me?\u201d Each one of them did it. I think that joy in the record is felt and even just raised the level of the bar.",
      "BON JOVI: Oh, it\u2019s fantastic. I mean, I\u2019ve looked up to him my whole life. The E Street Band are our Beatles. They were just 25 miles away from where I was as a kid. You know, Highway 9 was out my window. You know, these are, these are my streets, too. And so, it was fabulous because he loved that song (\u201cHollow Man.\u201d) Even when it was a demo, he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s a really special song.\u201d So, when I called him on that one instead of the obvious single, he was like, \u201cYou know, yeah, I get it, I can do that.\u201d",

      "Samara Joy\u2019s voice transports listeners to the early jazz clubs, evoking legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Samara Joy\u2019s voice has the ability to transform listeners to the early jazz clubs, filling them with warm nostalgia for legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "At 25, Joy is a five-time Grammy winning recording artist, whose album, \u201cLinger Awhile\u201d won her best new artist and best jazz vocal album in 2023. She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",
      "For Joy, releasing \u201cPortrait\u201d was a creative challenge and a turning point toward trusting her creative instincts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about what I can do and to stand firm in the creative vision and the direction that I see for myself,\u201d she said.",
      "Joy sat down with The Associated Press to talk about life post-Grammy wins, how diving into \u201cPortrait\u201d helped her grow as an artist and what it means to make her mark on the classic genre.",
      "This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "JOY: This album was a turning point. Because I feel like it was the first time I really had to make a decision about what my path was going to be. With the first two albums, it was just songs that I loved and felt like I could interpret as my own. And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs. And honestly kind of opened up even more to my band mates and said, arrange. I want you guys to orchestrate this next era.",

And I think this album taught me the importance of patience and not rushing to stay relevant or spark up a moment or just stay in that moment. It taught me to just take my time and really wait until you have something you feel like you have to say.",
      "JOY: I never expected to be nominated. I never thought that that was a possibility, at least so early on in my career.",

I\u2019m really thankful to everybody who believed in me enough to allow me to have that moment, who voted, who listened to my music, who support me then and still support me now. Which is why I never want to lose sight of what I do this for.",
      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",

And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",

The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

Did Morgan REALLY marry the boyfriend who told her on the beach that she was more fun when drunk? Yes, Morgan married Chris. And sister Jenny is with Jonah (bespectacled and dark and twisty, as Meredith Grey might say) \u2014 but only because a one-night stand has led to a baby, which they're co-parenting.",

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

      "The bulk of \u201cBugonia\u201d is the ideological dialogue between her and Teddy back in the basement. It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d). But, otherwise, \u201cBugonia\u201d has the feel of a quick follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d a black-comedy triptych also led by Stone and Plemons.",
      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",
      "\u201cBugonia,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny\u2019s music, along with backlash.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s carefully thought through,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever selected an artist where we didn\u2019t have some blowback or criticism. It\u2019s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a great show,\u201d Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \u201cHe understands the platform that he\u2019s on, and I think it\u2019s going to be exciting and a united moment.\u201d",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \u201cnever heard of\u201d Bad Bunny.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Trump said. \"I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we try to achieve. It\u2019s an important stage for us. It\u2019s an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",

      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if something does evolve. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re really focused on during the season.\u201d",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more fouls. You\u2019re going to get different sets of fouls. You\u2019re going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\u201d",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I\u2019m certain that the players will raise, and that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what collective bargaining is all about. They\u2019re going to need time to make sure that they\u2019re prepared, that they\u2019re ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\u201d",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and \u201829 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "Ballerina Misty Copeland has taken one last passionate spin on the ballet stage before saying goodbye",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "Allen told reporters that Copeland had \"helped to redefine the face of ballet. She\u2019s inspired millions of people around the world and hopefully, American Ballet Theatre will not wait another 50 years before they have another beautiful Black principal dancer.\u201d",

      "Copeland was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in San Pedro, California, where she lived in near poverty and through periods of homelessness as her single mother struggled to support her and five siblings.",
      "For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late \u2014 at 13 \u2014 but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference \u2014 a testament to her celebrity. Only days before, she\u2019d made a triumphant New York debut in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d in the starring role of Odette/Odile, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "In the AP interview, Copeland acknowledged that it\u2019s striking that when she leaves ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",
      "She also noted this is an especially trying moment for anyone working in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A major German private art collection accumulated over four generations is going on large-scale show for the first time in Berlin, with a who's who of French art of the 19th and 20th centuries at its core.",
      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Popular Greek singer-songwriter Dionysis Savvopoulos, known for his allegorical and deeply poetic lyrics that commented on Greek politics, identity and society, has died. He was 80.",
      "A prominent figure on the Greek cultural and intellectual scene, Savvopoulos died Tuesday night, his family announced on his official social media account. The musician had been hospitalized in recent days, and had been battling cancer for several years.",
      "Known by his nickname Nionios \u2014 a commonly used nickname for Dionysis \u2014 Savvopoulos rose to prominence in the 1960s, gaining national fame with his subtly revolutionary songs during the 1967-1974 military dictatorship. He was briefly imprisoned by the junta, and his songs became anthems of resistance for youths and dissidents in Greece.",
      "Tributes to Savvopoulos poured in from across the Greek political and cultural world.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it, but our Dionysis is no longer here,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis posted on his social media account. \u201cSavvopoulos is gone, leaving behind a strong imprint on music, on lyrics and on public style. Because with his work and stance, he proved that he was a wonderful songwriter. A sensitive Greek.\u201d",
      "Born in Thessaloniki on Dec. 2, 1944, Savvopoulos studied law but never completed his studies. He moved to Athens in 1963 and began pursuing his musical career, performing in small music clubs in the Greek capital.",
      "His songs blended multiple genres, including Greek popular music with rock and folk-rock elements, the music of American musicians such as Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa as well as traditional Greek music.",
      "He wrote both the music and lyrics for most of his songs, which had deeply political, romantic and humorous content. His debut album, \u201cFortigo,\u201d meaning Truck, was released in 1966 and became a major success, propelled him to fame with its combination of political commentary, rock influences and Greek folk idioms.",
      "He solidified his success with is second album, \u201cThe Fool\u2019s Garden,\u201d released three years later in 1969, during the military dictatorship. Savvopoulos quickly became one of Greece\u2019s leading voices of artistic dissent, and by the time the junta fell in 1974, he was considered one of the most important and original Greek songwriters of his generation.",

      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Hurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm, as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives.",
      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",
      "If possible, board up windows and place important documents such as passports and birth certificates in a waterproof case or even a Ziploc bag, Schulze said. That will prevent damage and make documents easier to locate in a quick evacuation.",
      "Mason recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.",
      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",
      "Hinote also urged people to review what type of insurance coverage they have and to make a home inventory of their possessions by taking photos of them in case an insurance claim needs to be made after a storm.",

      "Every family should have an emergency kit with supplies to meet its basic needs.",
      "For people who stay, a kit should include at least 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person, with enough for up to seven days, Mason said. One way to have enough water is to fill a bathtub.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",

      "\u201cWhile we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed.",
      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a big spending problem,\u201d McIntosh said.",
      "\u201cI think most people are going to say, OK, I had a great deal during COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s back to business as usual, and I should be paying for health care.\u201d",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- It's a name many people have trouble pronouncing, but these synthetic chemicals have been used in everything from fast-food packaging to nonstick cookware, clothing, household cleaning products and even firefighting foam.",
      "PFAS \u2014 or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2014 resist breaking down and as a result have found their way into drinking water, soil, air and the bloodstreams of 99% of Americans.",
      "This is certainly true for people who live or work near a plume of contamination that has seeped beyond the boundaries of Cannon Air Force Base, where PFAS-laden firefighting foam was used for years.",
      "New Mexico health and environmental officials conducted a $1.2 million testing project, drawing blood from nearly 630 people. They shared the results Thursday night during a public meeting.",
      "The research shows 99.7% of participants had one or more PFAS in their blood, with the most common being associated with firefighting foams.",
      "While the percentage isn't surprising given the overall prevalence of so-called forever chemicals in the environment, officials said some residents living in the plume area showed dramatically higher concentrations than the broader testing group. About one-quarter of them had levels reaching the highest concentration tier used in national guidelines.",
      "The findings suggest a correlation with groundwater contamination migrating from the base, state officials said.",
      "New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said during the meeting that his agency will help the community in any way that it can but that the state is still locked in litigation with the U.S. Defense Department over the damage caused by the contamination.",
      "At Cannon Air Force Base, state officials have reported that PFAS has been detected in groundwater at concentrations of 26,200 parts per trillion, exceeding state and federal drinking water standards by over 650,000%.",
      "Cannon reported earlier this year that it has spent more than $73 million so far on investigating the problem and installing pilot projects to treat contaminated groundwater.",
      "Kenney said it's time for the federal government to move ahead with cleanup outside the base.",
      "\u201cWe need the whole of New Mexico to stand up and say we\u2019ve had it,\u201d he said.",

      "State officials in a report published in August said some of the chemicals can linger in the blood for several years after exposure. Research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also found it can take weeks to years for levels of many PFAS to decrease by half in human blood, assuming exposure isn't ongoing.",
      "It's not easy to draw a bright line between exposure and health effects, said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Working Group.",
      "\u201cThere are so many different factors that affect individual health outcomes and also affect what levels you will see in your blood,\u201d she said, explaining that a person's age, where they live, what they eat and drink and where they work can all play a role.",
      "According to slides shared with the audience, the tests in Curry County showed PFAS levels tend to increase with age, that males had higher levels, and those who had military or aviation careers had higher concentrations \u2014 all things consistent with national data.",
      "Watchdog groups that track PFAS nationwide say contamination is more widespread than previously thought. They're using data released by the EPA and states to compile maps showing spots across the country where drinking water systems report levels above what's recommended. Contamination has also been confirmed at hundreds of military bases around the country.",
      "That includes a base in southern New Mexico, where state officials are embarking on another health survey to gauge exposure at a nearby lake where scientists documented some of the highest PFAS levels in wildlife and plants worldwide.",

      "Separate from the legal front, some states have adopted their own PFAS rules while the focus of federal regulations have been narrowed. New Mexico just this week held a webinar on a new state law that calls for phasing out and ultimately prohibiting the sale of products containing intentionally added PFAS.",

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov.

      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",

      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",

      "As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "Imams around Morocco have read government-written sermons urging parents to involve their children in public affairs",
      "RABAT, Morocco -- Worshippers sat shoeless on the red-carpeted floor of a mosque in Morocco's capital in silence, listening to a preacher in a raised pulpit reading a government-written sermon urging parents to involve their children in public affairs.",
      "The sermon, heard in mosques across the kingdom Friday, came after Morocco was shaken by an unprecedented and deadly youth uprising in recent weeks that demanded better social and economic conditions. The sermon didn\u2019t directly address the protests, but was seen by some as an effort by the government to send a message to demonstrators in the movement, known as Gen Z 212.",
      "Preachers traditionally chose the topics of their sermons that precede congregational prayers. But in recent years, governments in countries including Morocco, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have dictated sermon content. Officials say the move aims to curb extremist speech, but critics argue it turns sermons into tools for promoting the state\u2019s vision and backing its policies.",
      "In a mosque in the Moroccan capital of Rabat, the imam, dressed in a white djellaba robe and speaking on a microphone to hundreds of worshippers from different ages, social and economic backgrounds, urged the faithful to fulfill their duty to the nation by participating in civic life.",
      "\u201cOne of the most important things we should care about is raising children to participate in the managing of public affairs (...) and participation in serving the nation, loving the homeland and watching over its security and stability,\u201d the imam said.",
      "\u201cA true citizen is the one who serves his nation and does it well,\u201d he added, citing verses from the Quran, his voice echoing outside the mosque. Imams in Morocco are government employees, and sermons are standardized. The same sermon heard in Rabat is delivered across the country\u2019s 53,000 mosques and aired live on public television.",
      "The protests stemmed from anger over government spending in sports infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup while public services were perceived as neglected. They were organized on social media platforms like Discord by an anonymous group that rejects any affiliation to political parties and called for toppling a government it views as corrupt.",
      "Government officials said they heard the young activists\u2019 grievances and called on them to engage in dialogue and debate with institutions and in the public sphere. Several new measures, announced in a Cabinet meeting chaired by King Mohammed VI last week, are aimed at boosting youth political participation and job opportunities.",
      "They include a draft bill that would simplify election candidacy requirements for people younger than 35 and provide financial support covering 75% of their campaign fees. Many observers drew a direct link between the measure and the content of Friday\u2019s sermon.",
      "The government also said the 2026 budget draft will allocate a record $15 billion (140 billion dirhams) on health and education, billions more than what was spent this year, will create 27,000 jobs in the two sectors, upgrade 90 hospitals and improve the overall quality of education.",

The appeal court of Agadir, a coastal city 296 miles (477 kilometers) from Rabat, sentenced 33 defendants to a total of 260 years in prison for vandalism, local media reported.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope the real purpose behind these sermons is to support young people\u2019s participation in public affairs, not to guide or restrict them,\u201d said Soufiane, an 18-year-old college student at a weekend protest in Casablanca. He spoke on condition his last name not be used because of fear of retribution.",

      "After the government's promises and Friday's sermons, weekend protests drew fewer than expected participants. Only dozens appeared at Saturday's Casablanca gathering.",

      "The Netherlands is heading to the polls again, less than two years after Geert Wilders led his party to a surprise victory",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Less than two years after anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders led his party to a stunning victory in Dutch parliamentary elections, the Netherlands is going to the polls again.",
      "The lawmaker, who has lived under round-the-clock protection for more than 20 years due to death threats, triggered Wednesday's snap elections in June by hauling his Party for Freedom ministers out of a fractious four-party ruling coalition in a dispute over his far-reaching plans to crack down on immigration.",
      "Reining in migration has again dominated campaigning ahead of the vote for all 150 seats in the Dutch parliament's legislative House of Representatives, as even parties that usually occupy the political middle ground have been tugged to the right by the popularity of Wilders' fierce rhetoric.",
      "But even if Wilders wins again \u2014 and polls suggest it will be a knife-edge result \u2014 he will struggle to form a majority coalition as major parties have ruled out joining him, even before election day.",
      "The leader of the center-right Christian Democrats, Henri Bontenbal, said Wilders\u2019 party and the far-right Forum for Democracy \u201cdo not defend democracy, and it\u2019s very important to defend democracy in these days.\u201d",
      "The outgoing government led by Dick Schoof, a career civil servant hand-picked by Wilders to become prime minister, went down in history as one of the shortest-lived in modern Dutch history and was notorious for infighting among its members.",
      "Wilders, whose party won 37 seats in the last election in late 2023, is unrepentant, arguing that he was left no choice but to bring down the government because other coalition parties balked at supporting his anti-immigration agenda.",
      "Most parties want to cut the number of migrants arriving in this often crowded nation of 18 million people. Other major issues are tackling a shortage of affordable housing and reining in soaring health care costs. Issues that have taken a back seat include the climate crisis and defense spending as Europe ramps up military readiness to counter Russian aggression.",
      "Wilders, sometimes referred to as the Dutch Donald Trump, has focused his election campaign on a 10-point plan to enforce a total halt to asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands, including turning people back at the borders with Belgium and Germany.",
      "\u201cThe Netherlands has become one big asylum-seekers center,\u201d he said during a televised debate where he was repeatedly criticized by his political opponents for installing what they called incompetent ministers in the last government and then bringing it down.",
      "The Dutch lurch toward the right fits into a worldwide shift, said L\u00e9onie de Jonge, professor of research on far-right extremism at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely seeing a steady and global rise of the far right. It\u2019s a global phenomenon, and the Netherlands is not immune to that,\u201d De Jonge said in a telephone interview.",
      "Anti-immigrant protests have turned violent, including demonstrations against asylum-seeker centers and recent rioting in The Hague where a police car was torched and the headquarters of a centrist political party was attacked.",

      "The Christian Democrats were not part of the last ruling coalition after suffering a slump in their vote in 2023. But the party is now polling strongly under the leadership of former sustainability adviser Bontenbal, who is campaigning on a pledge to restore decency to Dutch politics.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen is two years of politics of division and chaos. What we want ... to present is a politics of hope and responsibility,\" Bontenbal told The Associated Press during a campaign stop in his home city of Rotterdam.",
      "Bontenbal is one of several leaders of mainstream parties who has ruled out joining Wilders' party in a coalition government.",
      "University of Amsterdam professor Claes de Vreese said that if Wilders wins the vote and is unable to form a majority coalition, \u201cthen a minority Cabinet could be an option. But that is a construction that hardly exists in the Dutch political tradition.\"",
      "If forming a minority coalition fails, \u201chistorically, the biggest party loses the right to form a coalition and it goes to the second-placed party.\u201d But, De Vreese added, \u201cthis process is more based on conventions and history than a ready-made plan.\u201d",
      "Another strong contender is the center-left bloc of Green Left and the Labor Party led by former European Climate Commissioner Frans Timmermans. He wants to move on from what he casts as the stasis of the Schoof administration.",
      "\u201cThe problem of this country is that in the last couple of years nothing has happened,\" he told AP. \u201cNo problem was solved, every problem got even bigger. So what we need to do is ... get this country working again and put this country on a social track.\u201d",
      "Timmermans' party is campaigning on a platform of building 100,000 new homes a year to alleviate a chronic shortage of affordable houses.",
      "While the outcome of the election is far from certain, one thing is for sure: Another coalition government, and possibly months of negotiations to cobble together enough parties to form a majority in the House of Representatives.",
      "Voter Herman de Jong, visiting a market in Rotterdam while Bontenbal was campaigning is tired of the political infighting.",
      "\u201cWe need stability, calmness, unity, something like that,\" he said. \"I think the constant arguing between the parties isn\u2019t good for the people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A report says at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups remain worldwide and face growing threats from logging, mining, missionaries and organized crime",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- From the depths of Brazil\u2019s Amazon to Indonesia\u2019s rainforests, some of the world\u2019s most isolated peoples are being squeezed by roads, miners and drug traffickers \u2014 a crisis unfolding far from public view or effective state protection.",
      "A new report by Survival International, a London-based Indigenous rights organization, attempts one of the broadest tallies yet, identifying at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups in 10 countries, primarily in the South American nations sharing the Amazon rainforest. Released Sunday, the report estimates that nearly 65% face threats from logging, about 40% from mining and around 20% from agribusiness.",
      "\u201cThese are what I would call silent genocides \u2014 there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they\u2019re happening now,\u201d said Fiona Watson, Survival's research and advocacy director, who has worked on Indigenous rights for more than three decades.",
      "The issue often receives little priority from governments, which critics say see uncontacted peoples as politically marginal because they don't vote and their territories are often coveted for logging, mining and oil extraction. Public debate is also shaped by stereotypes \u2014 some romanticize them as \u201clost tribes,\u201d while others view them as barriers to development.",
      "Survival\u2019s research concludes that half of these groups \u201ccould be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act.\u201d",
      "Uncontacted peoples are not \u201clost tribes\u201d frozen in time, Watson said. They are contemporary societies that deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t need anything from us,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing \u2014 essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\u201d",
      "Survival\u2019s research shows that more than 95% of the world\u2019s uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These communities live by hunting, fishing and small-scale cultivation, maintaining languages and traditions that predate modern nation-states.",
      "Groups living in voluntary isolation have \u201cminimal to no contact with those outside of their own group,\u201d said Dr. Subhra Bhattacharjee, director general of the Forest Stewardship Council and an Indigenous rights expert based in Bonn, Germany. \u201cA simple cold that you and I recover from in a week \u2026 they could die of that cold.\u201d",
      "Beyond disease, contact can destroy livelihoods and belief systems. International law requires free, prior and informed consent \u2014 known as FPIC \u2014 before any activity on Indigenous lands.",
      "\u201cBut when you have groups living in voluntary isolation, who you cannot get close to without risking their lives, you cannot get FPIC,\u201d Bhattacharjee said. \u201cNo FPIC means no consent.\u201d",
      "Her organization follows a strict policy: \u201cNo contact, no-go zones,\u201d she said, arguing that if consent cannot be obtained safely, contact should not occur at all.",
      "The Associated Press reported last year on loggers killed by bow and arrow after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru\u2019s Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
      "Watson, who has worked across the Amazon for 35 years, said early threats stemmed from colonization and state-backed infrastructure. During Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, highways were bulldozed through the rainforest \u201cwithout due regard\u201d for the people living there.",
      "\u201cThe roads acted as a magnet for settlers,\u201d she said, describing how loggers and cattle ranchers followed, bringing gunmen and disease that wiped out entire communities.",
      "A railway line now planned in Brazil could potentially affect three uncontacted peoples, she said, but the rise of organized crime poses an even greater risk.",
      "Across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, drug traffickers and illegal gold miners have moved deep into Indigenous territories. \u201cAny chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd bows and arrows are no match for guns.\u201d",
      "Evangelical missionary incursions have also caused outbreaks. Watson recalled how, under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical pastor was placed in charge of the government\u2019s unit for uncontacted peoples and gained access to their coordinates. \u201cTheir mission was to force contact \u2014 to \u2018save souls,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat is incredibly dangerous.\u201d",
      "Protecting uncontacted peoples, experts say, will require both stronger laws and a shift in how the world views them \u2014 not as relics of the past, but as citizens of the planet whose survival affects everyone\u2019s future.",

      "Mapping is crucial, Bhattacharjee said, because identifying the approximate territories of uncontacted peoples allows governments to protect those areas from loggers or miners. But, she added, it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups\u2019 health or autonomy.",
      "Second, corporations and consumers must help stop the flow of money driving destruction. Survival\u2019s report calls for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from Indigenous lands.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion and pressure are essential,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s largely through citizens and the media that so much has already been achieved to recognize uncontacted peoples and their rights.\u201d",
      "Finally, advocates say the world must recognize why their protection matters. Beyond human rights, these communities play an outsized role in stabilizing the global climate.",
      "\u201cWith the world under pressure from climate change, we will sink or swim together,\u201d Bhattacharjee said.",
      "International treaties such as the International Labor Organization\u2019s Convention 169 and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirm the right to self-determination and to remain uncontacted if they choose. But enforcement varies widely.",

      "Watson said logging remains the biggest single threat, but mining is close behind. She pointed to the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa on Indonesia\u2019s Halmahera Island, where nickel for electric-vehicle batteries is being mined.",

      "\u201cI plan to keep going for about five more years,\u201d Ono said last month as he marked Japan's \u201cRespect for the Aged Day\u201d with a gift and a certificate ahead of his birthday.",

      "In one of the world's fastest-aging countries, he is now among Japan's nearly 100,000 centenarians, according to government statistics.",
      "Born in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu in 1925, Ono began his apprenticeship at age 7 at the Japanese restaurant of a local inn. He moved to Tokyo and became a sushi chef at 25 and opened his own restaurant \u2014 Sukiyabashi Jiro \u2014 15 years later in 1965.",

      "Ono is devoted to what he serves to his regular clients, even turning down the Japanese government when it called to make a reservation for then-U.S. President Barack Obama and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2014.",

      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",

      "Efforts to back fill some of the cuts to U.S. foreign aid by the Trump administration raised over $125 million in eight months",
      "NEW YORK -- When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how to continue critical aid programs that could be funded by private donors.",
      "Multiple groups launched fundraisers in February and eventually, these emergency funds mobilized more than $125 million within eight months, a sum that while not nearly enough, was more than the organizers had ever imagined possible.",
      "In those early days, even with needs piling up, wealthy donors and private foundations grappled with how to respond. Of the thousands of programs the U.S. funded abroad, which ones could be saved and which would have the biggest impact if they continued?",
      "\u201cWe were fortunate enough to be in connection with and communication with some very strategic donors who understood quickly that the right answer for them was actually an answer for the field,\u201d said Sasha Gallant, who led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that specialized in identifying programs that were both cost effective and impactful.",
      "Members of Gallant's team, some of whom had been fired and others working outside of business hours, pulled together a list that eventually included 80 programs they recommended to private donors. In September, Project Resource Optimization, as their effort came to be called, announced all of the programs had been funded, with more than $110 million mobilized in charitable grants. Other emergency funds raised at least an additional $15 million.",
      "Those funds are just the most visible that private donors mobilized in response to the unprecedented withdrawal of U.S. foreign aid. It's possible private foundations and individual donors gave much more, but those gifts won't be reported for many months.",
      "For the Trump administration, the closure of USAID was a cause for celebration. In July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency had little to show for itself since the end of the Cold War.",
      "\u201cDevelopment objectives have rarely been met, instability has often worsened, and anti-American sentiment has only grown,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Going forward, Rubio said the State Department will focus on providing trade and investment, not aid, and will negotiate agreements directly with countries, minimizing the involvement of nonprofits and contractors.",
      "Some private donations came from foundations, who decided to grant out more this year than they had planned and were willing to do so because they trusted PRO's analysis, Gallant said. For example, the grantmaker GiveWell said it gave out $34 million it otherwise would not have to directly respond to the aid cuts, including $1.9 million to a program recommended by PRO.",
      "Others were new donors, like Jacob and Annie Ma-Weaver, a San Francisco-based couple in their late-thirties who, through their work at a hedge fund and a major tech company respectively, had earned enough that they planned to eventually give away significant sums. Jacob Ma-Weaver said the U.S. aid cuts caused needless deaths and were shocking, but he also saw in the moment a chance to make a big difference.",
      "\"It was an opportunity for us and one that I think motivated us to accelerate our lifetime giving plans, which were very vague and amorphous, into something tangible that we could do right now,\u201d he said.",
      "The Ma-Weavers gave more than $1 million to projects selected by PRO and decided to speak publicly about their giving to encourage others to join them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually very uncomfortable in our society \u2014maybe it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 to tell the world that you\u2019re giving away money,\u201d Jacob Ma-Weaver said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this embarrassment of riches about it, quite literally.\u201d",
      "The funds that PRO mobilized did not backfill USAID's grants dollar for dollar. Instead, PRO's team worked with the implementing organizations to pare down their budgets to only the most essential parts of the most impactful projects.",
      "For example, Helen Keller Intl ran multiple USAID-funded programs providing nutrition and treatment for neglected tropical diseases. All of those programs were eventually terminated, taking away almost a third of Helen Keller's overall revenue.",

      "Shawn Baker, an executive vice president at Helen Keller, said as soon as it became clear that the U.S. funding was not coming back, they started to triage their programming. When PRO contacted them, he said they were able to provide a much smaller budget for private funders. Instead of the $7 million annual budget for a nutrition program in Nigeria, they proposed $1.5 million to keep it running.",
      "Another nonprofit, Village Enterprise, received $1.3 million through PRO. But they were also able to raise $2 million from their own donors through a special fundraising appeal and drew on an unrestricted $7 million gift from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott that they\u2019d received in 2023. The flexible funding allowed them to sustain their most essential programming during what CEO Dianne Calvi called seven months of uncertainty.",
      "That many organizations managed to hold on and keep programs running, even after significant funding cuts, was a surprise to the researchers at PRO. Since February, the small staff supporting PRO have extended their commitment to the project one month at a time, expecting that either donations would dry up or projects would no longer be viable.",
      "\u201cThat time that we were able to buy has been absolutely invaluable in our ability to reach more people who are interested in stepping in,\u201d said Rob Rosenbaum, the team lead at PRO and a former USAID employee. He said they have taken a lot of pride in mobilizing donors who have not previously given to these causes.",
      "\u201cTo be able to convince somebody who might otherwise not spend this money at all or sit on it to move it into this field right now, that is the most important dollar that we can move,\u201d he said.",
      "Not all private donors were eager to jump into the chasm created by the U.S. foreign aid cuts, which happened without any \u201crhyme or reason,\" said Dean Karlan, the chief economist at USAID when the Trump administration took over in January.",
      "Despite the extraordinary mobilization of resources by some private funders, Karlan said, \u201cYou have to realize there\u2019s also a fair amount of reluctance, rightly so, to clean up a mess that creates a moral hazard problem.\"",
      "The uncertainty about what the U.S. will fund going forward is likely to continue for some time. The emergency funds offered a short term response from interested private funders, many of whom are now trying to support the development of whatever comes next.",
      "For Karlan, who is now a professor of economics at Northwestern University, it is painful to see the consequences of the aid cuts on recipient populations. He also resents the attacks on the motivations of aid workers in general.",
      "Nonetheless, he said many in the field want to see the administration rebuild a system that is efficient and targeted. But Karlan said, he hasn't yet seen any steps, \u201cthat give us a glimpse of how serious they\u2019re going to be in terms of actually spending money effectively.\u201d",

      "Brazilian farmers are increasing soybean production as the U.S. and China engage in a trade fight",
      "SANTA CRUZ DO RIO PARDO, Brazil -- Brazilian farmer Andrey Rodrigues wasn\u2019t planning to beef up soybean production for next year\u2019s harvest until a couple of months ago, but now he\u2019s extra hopeful. What has him and his fellow Brazilian farmers planting more soybeans is the trade war between the Trump administration and China that has shut American soybeans out of the massive Chinese market.",
      "China is actively seeking out Brazilian producers and the local trading companies that buy Rodrigues' soybeans to sell to China have put the word out over the past two months that they will take all they can get, he said.",
      "Just how much China will buy from Brazil remains to be seen, but China's customs body said it did not import any soybeans from the U.S. in September. It's the first time that's happened since November 2018 when President Donald Trump launched his first trade war with China. Brazilian beans already accounted for more than 70% of China\u2019s imports last year while the U.S. share was down to 21% even before the current trade dispute began, World Bank data shows.",
      "Rodrigues, who chairs the soybean farmers association in Brazil\u2019s powerhouse Sao Paulo state, is ramping up production at his Morada do Sol farm in the city of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo.",
      "The U.S.-China trade war \u201copens an opportunity for us here,\" said Rodrigues, as he kicked off the highly mechanized process on his farm on a recent sunny day. \"We need to be very aware in moments like this. Try to sell futures for the next harvest, seize this chance now.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s government said that between January and August, 77 million metric tons of soybeans were exported to China. That represents most of the South American country's first season harvest.",
      "During that period, China imported 17 million metric tons from the U.S., according to China\u2019s customs data.",
      "As the U.S. soybean harvest begins, there's no indication that China is buying American.",
      "The number of cargo ships carrying U.S. grains and docking at a major Chinese grains port fell 56% between January and September this year over the same period the previous year, or from 72 to 32, according to a social media account of the state broadcaster China Central Television. The number has fallen to zero since July.",
      "By comparison, that port received an average of more than 40 cargo ships from countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay since May, and 90% of the cargo was soybeans, according to the state broadcaster\u2019s post.",
      "\u201cChina comes to us because of prices. Whenever they have higher tariffs in a given country, they come to us,\u201d said Rodrigues.",
      "The American Soybean Association said that China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on top of other taxes pushed the overall duties on U.S. soybeans to 34% in 2025, which has driven the price of American soybeans well above Brazil's.",
      "Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said in October it expected the next soybean harvest, the one that Rodrigues is planting now, to rise 3.6%, to almost 178 million metric tons in comparison with this year's.

      "China's ambition to rival Boeing and Airbus with its homegrown C919 passenger jet is hitting turbulent skies",
      "HONG KONG -- China\u2019s ambition to challenge Boeing and Airbus with its own homegrown passenger jet is running into turbulence, with deliveries of finished aircraft likely to fall far short of its target announced for this year.",
      "The C919 jet -- a single-aisle passenger plane aiming to rival Boeing\u2019s 737 and Airbus\u2019 A320 \u2013 is made by state-owned aircraft manufacturer COMAC. Beijing is showcasing it as evidence of China's technological advancement and progress in self-reliance, though it uses many Western sourced components.",
      "Trade friction with Washington threatens to prevent COMAC from securing core parts for the program that has been supported by huge Chinese government subsidies.",
      "\u201cCOMAC faces significant risk from the volatile policy environment, with its supply chains vulnerable to export restrictions and tit-for-tat measures between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Max J. Zenglein, Asia-Pacific senior economist at The Conference Board think tank.",
      "The C919 has 48 major suppliers from the U.S. -- including GE, Honeywell and Collins -- 26 from Europe and 14 from China, according to analysts at the Bank of America. Trump threatened to impose new export controls on \u201ccritical\u201d software to China after Beijing imposed stricter export controls on rare earths.",
      "\u201cExisting choke points are being exploited in the deal making process between governments,\u201d Zenglein said. \u201cThis is likely to continue as critical dependencies have become political bargaining chips.\u201d",
      "Beijing has high hopes for the C919, which made its maiden commercial flight in 2023. The mid-sized jet is meant to help fill vast domestic demand for new aircraft over the next few decades. China hopes to expand sales beyond its borders and fly globally, including in Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.",
      "COMAC delivered 13 C919s to Chinese carriers last year and only seven as of October this year, despite plans to ramp up production and deliver 30 jets in 2025, according to the aviation consultancy Cirium.",
      "China\u2019s biggest state-owned airlines -- Air China, China Eastern and China Southern -- are the only commercial airlines currently flying a total of around 20 C919s.",
      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have \u201cdirectly affected\u201d delivery schedules for the C919, said Dan Taylor, head of consulting at aviation consultancy IBA. For one, output plans were disrupted when the U.S. suspended export licenses for the jet\u2019s LEAP-1C engines around May, resuming them in July, he said.",
      "U.S.-controlled technology that needs export licensing for the LEAP-1C engines -- jointly built by the U.S.\u2019s GE Aerospace and France\u2019s Safran -\u2014 means the C919's engines require U.S. export clearance, Taylor said, making it \u201cinherently sensitive to political shifts.\u201d",

      "Geopolitical tensions alone are not the only cause for slower than expected production of the C919s. The program has been \"marked by caution and prioritizing quality and safety, so there also may be some operational reasons for the slower production ramp up,\u201d said Zenglein from The Conference Board.",
      "While \u201cit has always been the aim to reduce the reliance on foreign components as quickly as possible\u201d for the C919, Zenglein said, many analysts say it is a challenging process. China's own engine alternative -- the CJ-1000A under development by state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) -- is still under testing, according to IBA.",
      "Several airlines outside of China, including AirAsia, have expressed interest in flying the C919, but a lack of international certification has so far prevented the C919 from flying beyond China. Certifications from the U.S. and the European Union\u2019s aviation regulators could take years.",
      "For the C919 to succeed, it \u201cneeds to have each one of three things: good economics, a prompt global product support network, and certification from safety agencies\u201d, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cAny one of these three alone doesn\u2019t mean much,\u201d he said.",
      "China will need 9,570 new passenger aircraft between 2025 and 2044, according to Airbus\u2019 latest market forecast, more than 80% of them single-aisle jets like the C919.",
      "COMAC's faces a growing challenge from Airbus, which is expanding its manufacturing capacity in China. A second assembly line is due to begin operating in 2026, allowing Airbus to increase its production of A320 single-aisle jets in China \u2013 an aircraft model similar to the C919.",
      "Analysts expect that it will take years for COMAC to break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in global aircraft share. By the late 2020s, COMAC will likely grow within China and possibly establish regional exports, said IBA\u2019s Taylor.",
      "In the near term, a lack of international certification will be \u201cdelaying any meaningful Western-market entry\u201d for the jet and export control volatility will likely continue to undermine its global expansion plans, Taylor added.",

      "In an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d Duffy said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.",

Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant\u2019s visa expires sooner.",

      "NEW YORK -- For nearly three years, JPMorgan Chase has picking up the legal tab of Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar, the two convicted fraudsters who sold their financial aid startup Frank to the bank.",
      "But the two have racked up an astronomical, nine-figure legal bill that far exceeds any reasonable amount the two may have needed for their defense, the bank said in a court filing late Friday. Chase shouldn't have to pay and its agreement as part of the startup purchase to shoulder the costs should end, the bank argued.",
      "According to the filing, Javice\u2019s team of lawyers across five law firms have billed JPMorgan approximately $60.1 million in legal fees and expenses, while Amar\u2019s lawyers have billed the bank roughly $55.2 million in fees.",
      "In total, the bank alleges Javice and Amar's lawyers have racked up legal fees of $115 million, with one law firm receiving $35.6 million in reimbursements alone. In comparison, Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of defrauding investors in the Theranos case, reportedly ended up with a legal bill of roughly $30 million.",
      "The bank would be \u201cirreparably injured\u201d if the court does not put an end to \u201cabusive billing,\" the bank said. Javice and her lawyers have treated the process \u201clike a blank check,\u201d Chase said.",
      "Javice, 33, was convicted in March of duping the banking giant when it bought her company, called Frank, in the summer of 2021. She made false records that made it seem like Frank had over 4 million customers when it had fewer than 300,000. Amar was convicted of the same charges.",

      "Jonathan Reckford shares insights from his 20 years as CEO of Habitat for Humanity International",
      "Jonathan Reckford jokes that before he became CEO of Habitat for Humanity International he couldn\u2019t really keep a job.",
      "In the two decades after he graduated from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Reckford had been a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs, coach of the Korean rowing team for the 1988 Olympics, and held executive and managerial positions at Marriott, Disney and Best Buy. He was executive pastor at Christ Presbyterian Church near Minneapolis, when he was recruited to lead Habitat in 2005.",
      "What Reckford did not expect was how the twin disasters of the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina would make the global housing nonprofit expand its work so quickly. Or that they would make building affordable housing such a major priority.",
      "\u201cIt was an inflection point,\u201d Reckford, 63, told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cThose two giant disasters forced Habitat to change in some ways that I think had long-term benefits. We were designed as a grassroots movement to build a few houses in thousands of locations. Suddenly, we needed to work at scale in a few countries in Asia and then across the Gulf Coast. I\u2019m really proud of these enormous efforts.\u201d",
      "Reckford talked about other lessons learned in his 20 years leading Habitat, as he prepared for the annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project \u2014 the first since the death of Reckford's \u201chero and role model\u201d President Carter in December \u2013 which will build 25 sustainable homes in Austin, Texas, starting on Oct. 26. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Exactly. One thing we certainly see everywhere in the world \u2014 global North or global South \u2014 is it\u2019s 5 to 7 times cheaper to invest in mitigation than it is to fix stuff after the disaster. Another thing for the public to know is about 80% of the funds after a big disaster go to the relief effort. You certainly need all of that relief effort. But then there\u2019s very little left for long-term recovery. And the practical reality after these big disasters is that it\u2019s a 10-year cycle, a 15-year cycle to really come back.",
      "It does because we\u2019re seeing more extreme weather. It\u2019s not about politics. We\u2019re having more flooding events and we have an insurance crisis from an affordability perspective. We\u2019re investing in fortified housing. We always want to build relative to the risks in the area and we\u2019ve had a really good record. We\u2019re trying to do it to convince the insurance industry that families should get lower insurance payments because we\u2019ve created safer housing. It\u2019s just cost effective. It makes more sense to invest in lowering risk because it\u2019s incredibly expensive to do the rescuing afterwards.",
      "The day after I was announced, we drove and built the 200,000th Habitat home in Knoxville, Tennessee, and that meant Habitat had helped about a million people worldwide. As of last year, we\u2019ve helped another 61 million people. A big piece of that I would say was changing our framing question from \u201cHow many houses can we build?\u201d which was a really good question, to \u201cWhat would it take to actually address the housing need?\u201d",
      "What we found, especially in middle- and low-income countries, is that only about 5-10% of the population have access to a bank loan for housing. We started lending money to microfinance banks and training them on how to do home improvement lending.",
      "Those experiments went well enough that 12 years ago, we launched the MicroBuild Fund. We raised $100 million \u2014 borrowed $90 million of that, which was the first time we\u2019d ever taken on debt \u2014 and now, 12 years later, we\u2019re winding that fund down and getting ready to launch an even bigger fund.",
      "The fund has loaned out $230 million to 56 microfinance banks in 36 countries. Those banks found their home loan repayment rates have been as good or better than their small business loans, so it\u2019s created a new business channel for them. It\u2019s directly helped a million people make home improvements.",

This is scalable on a level that we can\u2019t match. It\u2019s a much greater number than we could ever build.",
      "Yeah, I\u2019m sad to say you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll give you an oversimplified, quick version of how I\u2019ve seen this happen. We\u2019ve always had an affordability challenge. But what\u2019s really shocking in the last six years is how much worse it\u2019s gotten.",
      "If you go back to the housing crisis, lots has been written about what went wrong and how that sort of corrupted the whole housing value chain. But what really happened, in my view, is if you look at the small builders or the big builders after the housing crisis, the big builders got recapitalized and came back. The small builders didn\u2019t. And they represented, depending on the market, 50-60% of the housing supply.",
      "As we started under-building, initially, there was a ton of housing. But we had ten, 12 years of under-building by hundreds of thousands of units a year. The cumulative impact of that starts to add up. We need an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to address that.",

      "South Carolina's state-owned utility is negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management to revive a nuclear power project abandoned eight years ago",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.",
      "Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.",
      "Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.",
      "Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.",
      "\u201cThe risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,\u201d Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.",
      "There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.",
      "\u201cI still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,\u201d Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.",
      "Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.",

      "Some four years after players from the Afghanistan women\u2019s national team fled their homeland amid the Taliban\u2019s takeover, a number of the teammates are representing their country once more in an international soccer tournament",
      "Four years after players from the Afghanistan women's national team fled their homeland amid the Taliban's takeover, a number of the teammates are representing their country again in a soccer tournament. Only this time as refugees.",
      "The tournament represents a first major step in the fight to be officially recognized as a national team on the global stage. Collectively they call themselves Afghan Women United.",
      "\u201cIt's really exciting to see each other, hug each other and finally share and play together,\" said captain Fatima Haidari, who lives in Italy. \"As an athlete I say, you will face challenges and difficulties in your life, but you always can overcome and never give up. Never give up.\"",
      "FIFA, soccer's international governing body, is staging a four-team friendly tournament in Morocco that includes the refugee team along with Chad, Libya and Tunisia. The event dubbed FIFA Unites: Women\u2019s Series 2025, started Sunday.",
      "The tournament comes after years of lobbying by players, former captain and activist Khalida Popal, and human rights groups, to facilitate the team's return to competition.",
      "\u201cWith all the challenges that we have been through, all the barriers that we faced, finally, after four years and some months, the girls are playing football as the Afghan team,\" Popal said, \u201cbut with no title.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad the girls are playing. Is it enough? No. But it\u2019s a good start.\u201d",
      "The tournament was originally set for Dubai, and was to include Chad, Libya and the host United Arab Emirates. In Australia, where some members of the team have settled, there were media reports that the players were unable to obtain visas. FIFA didn't give a reason for the move.",
      "The Afghan women's national team played its last official competitive game in 2018. The Taliban regime's return to power in 2021 shut down all women's sports.",
      "But even before the demise of the team, the Afghan soccer federation was under investigation for misconduct involving the women's program, including allegations of rape and physical abuse. Keramuddin Keram, the federation president, was banned for life by FIFA.",
      "The players fled Afghanistan as the Taliban took over, fearing persecution. Some have spoken out about the harrowing ordeal, burning their kits to avoid detection and scrambling to get out.",
      "\u201cWe faced challenges or difficulties that I don\u2019t even want to remember because it was really bitter,\" Haidari said. \u201cIt is about leaving your homeland and all your friends, family and all the people that you know. What makes me sad is there are still some girls and women that are not playing, but they hope to be on the international pitch like us, like we are here now. We want to be their voice.\u201d",
      "While many ended up in Australia, there are Afghan players spread across Europe and some in the United States. FIFA held identification camps in Australia and England, calling in 70 players before whittling the roster down to 23 for the tournament, coach Pauline Hamill said.",

They\u2019ve been waiting a long time. And this tournament ... gives us the perfect chance to play matches together and then be really excited about the future.\u201d",
      "While the Afghan federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination, it hasn't been suspended from international soccer despite failing to acknowledge the women's team.",
      "Players and their advocates have fought for official recognition. In May the FIFA Council approved the Strategy for Action for Afghan Women\u2019s Football. But the team cannot yet represent Afghanistan in Women's World Cup qualifying or Asian championships.",
      "While the tournament in Morocco is a first step, the goal is to become independent of FIFA, Popal said. But she wanted to emphasize that players are grateful to the organization for making this important move.",

      "Aaron Rodgers was solid but not spectacular in his first-ever game against the Green Bay Packers",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Aaron Rodgers spent the week insisting his first-ever game against the Green Bay Packers wasn't personal. That he wasn't looking for revenge against the team he defined for the better part of two decades.",
      "Good thing, because there was none to be had on Sunday night in Pittsburgh's 35-25 loss to Green Bay.",
      "Instead, there was only reminder after reminder that while the 41-year-old Rodgers can still compete at a high level, the team that surrounds him remains very much a work in progress. And maybe an iffy one at that.",
      "Rodgers threw for 219 yards and two scores in Pittsburgh's second straight loss, the first time he's ever looked across the field and watched the Packers celebrate victory on the other.",
      "\u201cDisappointed,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cDisappointed that I didn't play better, that we didn't play better, especially in the second half.\u201d",
      "Rodgers spent 18 years in Green Bay building a resume that will one day land him in the Hall of Fame. Four MVPs and a Super Bowl title will do that. Yet rather than retire as a Packer, Rodgers kept going.",
      "That journey eventually brought him to Pittsburgh, where he is serving as a highly skilled stopgap to whichever franchise quarterback might come next. Rodgers has shown flashes that he can still bring it when he has to in his 21st season. But the days when his brilliance can almost single-handedly overcome his team's considerable warts are over.",
      "After a promising 4-1 start, the Steelers have dropped two straight and while Rodgers has no interest in riding the weekly roller coaster that is the NFL season, he's also well aware there's too much for Pittsburgh to address for him to get caught up in playing \u201cremember when\u201d when talking about the Packers.",
      "Rodgers spent a chunk of the pregame catching up with old friends, many of them members of the Green Bay support staff who have remained following his departure.",
      "Yet when he was introduced to a loud and long ovation while wearing Pittsburgh's garish or inspired (depending on your perspective) throwbacks, Rodgers was all business. All Pittsburgh.",
      "He deftly guided the Steelers to four scoring drives in the first half while building a 16-7 lead. The problem is, three of those drives ended in long field goals by Chris Boswell instead of touchdowns.",
      "\u201cBos bailed us out on four incredible kicks, but when you're playing good teams, you need to score touchdowns, and we stalled out in the high red zone,\u201d Rodgers said.",

      "Green Bay righted itself offensively after halftime behind Love \u2014 who at one point tied a franchise record by completing 20 straight passes \u2014 and Rodgers and the rest of the Steelers couldn't keep pace.",
      "Pittsburgh's first five possessions in the second half went punt, field goal, punt, punt, fumble. A wholly unnecessary 15-yard penalty against wide receiver DK Metcalf blunted a late drive before it even started. A fumble by running back Kenny Gainwell set up a Green Bay field goal that effectively put the game out of reach.",
      "\u201cWe can't beat ourselves,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI think in the three losses, there's been times where we've had opportunities and we've hurt ourselves with turnovers or just negative plays. So we got to cut those out. We got to get on the same page on offense and defense and keep the faith.\u201d",
      "That faith will be tested in the coming weeks. Pittsburgh welcomes AFC South leading Indianapolis next week before a trip to Los Angeles to face the Chargers. There is plenty to clean up, particularly on a high-priced defense that has looked overmatched for long stretches and has now not produced a turnover in three straight games.",
      "If there is a saving grace for Rodgers, it's this: there are no longer any more former teams for him to face this season. Seven weeks after his tenure with Pittsburgh began with a four-touchdown masterpiece against the Jets, he watched Love put on a Rodgers-like performance while he and the Steelers sputtered at key times.",
      "Afterward, Rodgers and Love shared a brief embrace at midfield, with Love putting in a request to get a signed jersey from the man who showed him what it means to be a professional quarterback.",
      "And as discouraged as he might have been at the final score, Rodgers also couldn't help but take notice of his protege, the player who looks and plays at times an awful lot like his mentor.",
      "\u201cHe played great,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe played fantastic. He's had a really nice season. He's been really efficient with the football.\u201d",
      "All sentences that have been used to describe Rodgers at times during his career. Just maybe not on Sunday, when nostalgia gave way to the reality that there is work to be done if Rodgers wants his one-year coda in Pittsburgh to end on a more upbeat note than his time in Green Bay did.",

      "H3 rocket replaces Japan's long-beloved mainstay H-2A rocket, which made its final flight in June, as a new flagship model designed to be more cost-competitive in the global space market. The H3 has so far made six consecutive successful flights after a failed debut attempt in 2023, when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",

      "China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys have joined pandas as diplomatic envoys to Europe",
      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",
      "Another trio of golden monkeys arrived at the Pairi Daiza zoo in Hainaut, Belgium, in May. The zoo distributed Belgian and Chinese hand flags to visitors on the day the monkeys arrived.",
      "After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. So far, they appear to be in good health, according to the two zoos, adapting to new climates outside Asia for the first time.",
      "At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs.",
      "\u201cThe diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,\u201d said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.",
      "The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Ana\u00efs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.",
      "The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs \u201csimilar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,\u201d Maury said.",
      "Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary\u2019s College of California.",
      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",
      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",
      "The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world\u2019s first Communist state.",
      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

      "Bordered by the Colorado River to the east, the Salton Sea to the northwest and Mexico to the south, the Imperial Valley is home to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and produces billions of dollars in agricultural production. It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",

In a given year, there are about 123 days with temperatures over 95 F (35 C), often exceeding 110 F (43 C) in August and early September, according to calculations by Sagar Parajuli, research scientist and adjunct faculty with SDSU's geography department. The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",
      "Some of their data analysis has already been published.",
      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern because an elevated nighttime temperature restricts the ability of farmworkers to cool down,\u201d said Parajuli, the study's lead author. \u201cSo they can\u2019t recover from the heat stress they could be accumulating from the daytime.\"",
      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",

      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",
      "It reminds Sarah Kreps, a Cornell University professor who teaches about the intersection of politics and technology, of politicians whose careers are ruined by affairs. Everyone sees the cautionary tales, but it doesn't stop the behavior.",
      "\u201cThere's this overconfidence \u2014 \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me. It happens to other people and it won't bring me down,'\u201d Kreps said.",
      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "The ability now to concoct something that sounds real, coupled with public mistrust in the media, compels news organizations to tell readers as much as possible about how the material was verified without breaking agreements to confidential sources.",
      "In its story about the January 2024 chat that Ingrassia was involved in, Politico said it interviewed two other participants.

      "She had met Halligan one time years before, and asked the texter to say when that meeting was and who she was with. After the person answered correctly, Bower checked through another source to see if the phone number the messages came from was indeed Halligan's.",

      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote at length about how he handled being added to the Signal text chain about military operations. He, too, initially thought it was a hoax. He removed himself from the chat group when he became convinced it was real, then received confirmation from the National Security Council.",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",

One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",

Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Researchers have unearthed a spooky pair of dinosaur mummies that seem to have been preserved in an unexpected way.",
      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",
      "Scientists have been uncovering dinosaur mummies for over a century. Some were buried quickly after dying, while others sank into bodies of water or dried out.",
      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",

If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",

      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",

      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",

      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

      "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29",
      "Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era.",
      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",
      "\u201cDaniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,\u201d said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia.",
      "Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play.",
      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",
      "Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially \u201cplaying chess entirely with your gut.\u201d",
      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",

      "\u201cPeople, they see Daniel or other streamers and they start to play online chess,\u201d said John Hartmann, editor of Chess Life magazine. \u201cThe streaming personalities, they lead people into the chess world.\u201d",
      "Carlsen credited Naroditsky for his work in the streaming space, saying he was \u201csuch a resource to the chess community.\u201d",

      "Netflix missed the earnings target set by stock market analysts during the video streamer\u2019s latest quarter, a letdown that the company blamed on a tax dispute in Brazil.",
      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

      "And now Netflix may have another opportunity to add even more compelling programming with Warner Bros. Discovery announcing it may sell all or part of its holdings, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN. Analysts are already speculating that Netflix may join the bidders looking to grab a piece of Warner Bros. Discovery.",
      "In response to a question about Netflix's acquisition strategy, Sarandos noted that the company traditionally has been \u201cmore builders than buyers\u201d without ruling out a potential bid for some of Warner Bros. Discovery's properties other than cable TV networks like CNN and TBS. \u201cWe can be and will be choosey,\u201d Sarandos said.",
      "The company has also mining a new vein of revenue by selling commercials as part of a low-priced option of its service it introduced three years ago.",
      "Although the advertising business still isn\u2019t large enough to require the company to disclose its sales, management expects its revenue to more than double from last year. A recent analyst by S & P forecast $1.1 billion in ad sales for Netflix this year \u2014 a figure that would represent about 2% of its projected total revenue.",
      "It\u2019s getting to the point that Netflix may be in danger of trying to juggle too many ball at once, said Forrester Research analyst Mike Proulx. \u201cIf the company goes too broad to become all things entertainment, it risks diluting its core.\u201d",

      "Camela Kay is expected to take the stand Monday to speak about her ex-husband, Angels' communication director Eric Kay, who was convicted of providing a fentanyl-laced pill that led to the death of pitcher Tyler Skaggs. He was later sentenced to 22 years in federal prison.",
      "After Skaggs' death, Camela Kay filed for divorce, according to Orange County court records.",
      "The testimony is expected in a civil trial for a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Skaggs' family contending the Angels should be held responsible for letting a drug-addicted and dealing employee stay on the job and access its players. The Angels say team officials did not know Skaggs was taking drugs and that any drug activity involving him and Kay happened on their own time and in the privacy of the player\u2019s hotel room.",
      "The trial comes more than six years after Skaggs, then 27, was found dead in the suburban Dallas hotel room where he was staying as the Angels were supposed to open a four-game series against the Texas Rangers. A coroner\u2019s report said Skaggs choked to death on his vomit and a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was found in his system.",
      "Eric Kay was convicted in 2022 of providing Skaggs with a counterfeit oxycodone pill laced with fentanyl. His federal criminal trial in Texas included testimony from five MLB players who said they received oxycodone from him at various times from 2017 to 2019, the years he was accused of obtaining pills and giving them to Angels players.",

      "NEW YORK -- New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani rallied supporters Sunday with heavyweight support from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the race enters its final stretch, telling a raucous crowd that his campaign is a \u201cmovement of the masses.\u201d",
      "Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, took the stage at a small stadium in Queens where he and two of the nation's leading progressives pitched his candidacy as a force to take on billionaires and \u201coligarchs\u201d who have thrown money and support behind his opponents.",
      "\u201cWhen you insist on building a coalition with room for every New Yorker, that is exactly what you create: a tremendous force,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cThis, my friends, was your movement, and it always will be.\u201d",
      "As the crowd chanted his name, Mamdani reiterated plans to hire thousands of new teachers, renegotiate city contracts, freeze rent for low-income residents, build more affordable housing and provide universal child care.",
      "With early voting underway ahead of Election Day on Nov. 4, Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is in an increasingly caustic race with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent candidate after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, who campaigned Sunday in Queens.",
      "Cuomo has sought to cast Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblymember, as a naive candidate whose agenda would damage the city. In a radio interview Sunday morning, Cuomo argued that he is the real Democrat in the race while saying Mamdani's democratic socialism would result in an exodus of residents and businesses.",
      "\u201cThe socialists want to take over the Democratic Party. That\u2019s what Bernie Sanders is all about. That\u2019s what AOC is all about,\u201d Cuomo said, adding, \u201cHe wins, book airline tickets for Florida now.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned as governor in 2021 following a barrage of sexual harassment allegations that he denies. Mamdani has often pressed Cuomo over the allegations, and on Sunday he told the crowd that it is time to leave behind the former governor's \u201cplaybook of the past.\u201d But he urged supporters not to take his lead in the polls for granted and to turn out to vote.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow complacency to infiltrate this movement,\u201d Mamdani said.",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have supported his campaign for months including before the Democratic primary in June. On Sunday they cast Mamdani as an antidote to what they called the creeping authoritarianism of President Donald Trump's administration.",

      "Centuries-old private libraries are bringing modern comfort and awe to book lovers and history buffs in New England",
      "BOSTON -- When David Arsenault takes down a worn, leather-bound 19th-century book from the winding shelves of the Boston Athenaeum, he feels a sense of awe \u2014 like he\u2019s handling an artifact in a museum.",
      "Many of the half a million books that line the library's seemingly endless maze of reading room shelves and stacks were printed before his great-great-grandparents were born. Among fraying copies of Charles Dickens novels, Civil War-era biographies and town genealogies, everything has a history and a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cIt almost feels like you shouldn\u2019t be able to take the books out of the building, it feels so special,\u201d said Arsenault, who visits the institution adjacent to Boston Common a few times a week. \u201cYou do feel like, and in a lot of ways, you are, in a museum \u2014 but it\u2019s a museum you get to not feel like you\u2019re a visitor in all the time, but really a part of.\u201d",
      "The more than 200-year-old institution is one of only about 20 member-supported private libraries in the U.S. dating back to the 18th- and 19th-centuries. Called athenaeums, a Greek word meaning \u201ctemple of Athena,\u201d the concept predates the traditional public library most Americans recognize today. The institutions were built by merchants, doctors, writers, lawyers and ministers who wanted to not only create institutions for reading \u2014 then an expensive and difficult-to-access hobby \u2014 but also space to explore culture and debate.",
      "Many of these athenaeums still play a vibrant role in their communities.",
      "Patrons gather to play games, join discussions on James Joyce, or even research family history. Others visit to explore some of the nation\u2019s most prized artifacts, such as the largest collection from George Washington \u2019s personal library at Mount Vernon at the Boston Athenaeum.",
      "In addition to conservation work, institutions acquire and uplift the work of more modern creatives who may have been overlooked. The Boston Athenaeum recently co-debuted an exhibit by painter Allan Rohan Crite, who died in 2007 and used his canvas to depict the joy of Black life in the city.",
      "One thing binds all athenaeums together: books and people who love them.",
      "\u201cThe whole institution is built around housing the books,\u201d said Matt Burriesci, executive director of Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island. \u201cThe people who come to this institution really appreciate just holding a book in their hands and reading it the old-fashioned way.\u201d",
      "Built to mimic an imposing Greek temple, staffers at the Providence Athenaeum often talk about the joy of watching people enter for the first time.",
      "Visitors must climb a series of cold, granite steps. Only then are they met with a thick wooden door that ushers them into a warm world filled with cozy reading nooks, hidden desks to leave secret messages to fellow patrons, and almost every square inch bursting with books.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the actual time capsule of people\u2019s reading habits over 200 years,\u201d Burriesci said, while pointing to a first-edition of Little Women, where the pages and spine proudly showcase years of being well read.",
      "Many athenaeums are designed to pay tribute to Greek influence and their namesake, the goddess of wisdom. In Boston, a city once dubbed \u201cthe Athens of America,\u201d visitors to the athenaeum are greeted by a nearly 7-foot-tall (2.1-meter-tall) bronze statue of Athena Giustiniani.",

      "The 12-level building includes five gallery floors where ornate busts of writers and historical figures decorate reading rooms with wooden tables overlooked by book-lined pathways reachable by spiral and hidden staircases.",
      "Natural light shines in from large windows where guests can look down to see one of Boston's most historic cemeteries where figures like Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock are buried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to leave many of these things out for people to peruse, and I think people can often get curious about something and just follow their curiosity into things that they didn\u2019t even know that they were going to be fascinated by,\u201d said Boston Athenaeum executive director Leah Rosovsky.",
      "When athenaeums were founded, they were exclusive spaces that only people with education and money could access.",
      "Some are now free. Most are open to the public for day passes and tours. Memberships to the Boston Athenaeum can range from $17 to $42 a month per person, depending on whether the patron is under 40 or is sharing the membership with family members.",
      "Charlie Grantham, a wedding photographer and aspiring novelist, said she first visited during one of the institution\u2019s annual community days, where the public can explore for free. She said she was surprised by how accessible it was and describes the space as \u201cBoston\u2019s best kept secret \u2014 an oasis in the middle of the city.\u201d",

      "Some people visit every day to work remotely, read or socialize, said Salem Athenaeum executive director Jean Marie Procious.",

    "story": [
      "More anti-abortion pregnancy centers have been offering medical services such as testing for sexually transmitted infections",
      "Pregnancy centers in the U.S. that discourage women from getting abortions have been adding more medical services \u2014 and could be poised to expand further.",
      "The expansion \u2014 ranging from testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections to even providing primary medical care \u2014 has been unfolding for years. It gained steam after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, clearing the way for states to ban abortion.",
      "The push could get more momentum with Planned Parenthood closing some clinics and considering shuttering others following changes to Medicaid. Planned Parenthood is not just the nation's largest abortion provider, but also offers cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other reproductive health services.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately want to replace Planned Parenthood with the services we offer,\u201d said Heather Lawless, founder and director of Reliance Center in Lewiston, Idaho. She said about 40% of patients at the anti-abortion center are there for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, including some who use the nurse practitioner as a primary caregiver.",
      "The changes have frustrated abortion-rights groups, who, in addition to opposing the centers' anti-abortion messaging, say they lack accountability; refuse to provide birth control; and most offer only limited ultrasounds that cannot be used for diagnosing fetal anomalies because the people conducting them don't have that training. A growing number also offer unproven abortion-pill reversal treatments.",
      "Because most of the centers don't accept insurance, the federal law restricting release of medical information doesn't apply to them, though some say they follow it anyway. They also don't have to follow standards required by Medicaid or private insurers, though those offering certain services generally must have medical directors who comply with state licensing requirements.",
      "\u201cThere are really bedrock questions,\u201d said Jennifer McKenna, a senior adviser for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, a project funded by liberal policy organizations that researches the pregnancy centers, \u201cabout whether this industry has the clinical infrastructure to provide the medical services it\u2019s currently advertising.\u201d",
      "Perhaps best known as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d these mostly privately funded and religiously affiliated centers were expanding services such as diaper banks ahead of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.",
      "As abortion bans kicked in, the centers expanded medical, educational and other programs, said Moira Gaul, a scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of SBA Pro-Life America. \u201cThey are prepared to serve their communities for the long-term,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In Sacramento, California, for instance, Alternatives Pregnancy Center in the last two years has added family practice doctors, a radiologist and a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, along with nurses and medical assistants. Alternatives \u2014 an affiliate of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of pregnancy centers in the U.S \u2014 is some patients' only health provider.",
      "When The Associated Press asked to interview a patient who had received only non-pregnancy services, the clinic provided Jessica Rose, a 31-year-old woman who took the rare step of detransitioning after spending seven years living as a man, during which she received hormone therapy and a double mastectomy.",
      "For the last two years, she\u2019s received all medical care at Alternatives, which has an OB-GYN who specializes in hormone therapy. Few, if any, pregnancy centers advertise that they provide help with detransitioning. Alternatives has treated four similar patients over the past year, though that's not its main mission, director Heidi Matzke said.",
      "\u201cAPC provided me a space that aligned with my beliefs as well as seeing me as a woman,\u201d Rose said. She said other clinics \"were trying to make me think that detransitioning wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.\u201d",
      "As of 2024, more than 2,600 anti-abortion pregnancy centers operated in the U.S., up 87 from 2023, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project led by University of Georgia public health researchers who are concerned about aspects of the centers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 765 clinics offered abortions last year, down more than 40 from 2023.",
      "Over the years, pregnancy centers have received a boost in taxpayer funds. Nearly 20 states, largely Republican-led, now funnel millions of public dollars to these organizations. Texas alone sent $70 million to pregnancy centers this fiscal year, while Florida dedicated more than $29 million for its \u201cPregnancy Support Services Program\u201d",
      "This boost in resources is unfolding as Republicans have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds under the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. While federal law already blocked the use of taxpayer funds for most abortions, Medicaid reimbursements for other health services were a big part of Planned Parenthood's revenue.",

      "Thomas Glessner, founder and president of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a network of 1,800 centers, said the centers do have government oversight through their medical directors. \u201cTheir criticism,\u201d he said, \u201ccomes from a political agenda.\u201d",
      "In recent years, five Democratic state attorneys general have issued warnings that the centers, which advertise to people seeking abortions, don't provide them and don't refer patients to clinics that do.

      "Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with limited experience in international affairs, will have to manage Trump's demands and unpredictability and China's wariness of her strong support for a military build-up and her right-wing views on Japan's invasion of China before and during World War II.",

      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will also attend the summit in South Korea, where talks with Trump are planned, but a one-on-one meeting with Takaichi would be a surprise.",
      "Neither Xi nor Chinese Premier Li Qiang has publicly congratulated Takaichi since she became prime minister on Tuesday. They extended immediate congratulations to her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who held more moderate positions on China.",
      "America has long been Japan\u2019s most important ally and protector, but as with NATO and other allies, Trump has demanded Japan contribute more for its defense. His tariffs on imports have also delivered a blow to the country\u2019s economy.",
      "Takaichi pledged Friday to accelerate a plan to increase defense spending to 2% of Japan's GDP, a measure of the size of the economy. The target would be reached in March instead of 2027, she said.",
      "\u201cIn the region around Japan, military activities and other actions from our neighbors China, North Korea and Russia are causing grave concerns,\u201d she said in a policy speech to parliament.",
      "Trump may be more focused in both Japan and South Korea on his demands for more investment in the United States, particularly for factories that would create jobs for American workers.",

      "Her paramount mission now is political stability, and experts think she will refrain from expressing her views on the war and stay away from the shrine to avoid any flareups that could shake her weak and untested coalition government.",

Patrick criticized her over an academic paper questioning the GOP-controlled Legislature's education policies and suggesting she wanted the historic site in Texas to have a broader focus.",
      "\u201cIt was with mixed emotions that I resigned my post as President and CEO at the Alamo Trust yesterday,\" Rogers said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. \"It became evident through recent events that it was time for me to move on.\u201d",
      "Several trust officials did not immediately respond to email or cellphone messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Patrick had posted a letter to the board Thursday on X, calling her paper \u201cshocking.\u201d She wrote it in 2023 for a doctorate in global education from the University of Southern California. Patrick posted a portion online.",
      "\u201cI believe her judgment is now placed in serious question,\" Patrick wrote. \"She has a totally different view of how the history of the Alamo should be told.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in an ongoing conflict over how the U.S. tells its history. Patrick\u2019s call for Rogers\u2019 ouster follows President Donald Trump\u2019s pressure to get Smithsonian museums in Washington to put less emphasis on slavery and other darker parts of America's past.",
      "The Alamo, known as \u201cthe Shrine of Texas Liberty,\u201d draws more than 1.6 million visitors a year. The trust operates it under a contract with the Texas General Land Office, and the state plans to spend $400 million on a renovation with a new museum and visitor center set to open in 2027. Patrick presides over the Texas Senate.",
      "In San Antonio, Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai, the county's elected top administrator, decried Patrick's \u201cgross political interference.\u201d",
      "\"We need to get politics out of our teaching of history. Period,\u201d he said in a statement Friday.",
      "In the excerpt from her paper, Rogers noted the Texas Legislature's \u201cconservative agenda\" in 2023, including bills to limit what could be taught about race and slavery in history courses.",

      "A commercial truck driver who is charged with killing three people in a deadly crash in Florida in August had failed a commercial driver\u2019s license repeatedly",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A commercial truck driver who is charged with killing three people in a deadly crash in Florida in August had failed a commercial driver's license test 10 times in the span of two months in 2023 in Washington state, before he was ultimately issued a license, according to a senior official in the Florida Attorney General's Office.",
      "Florida is using the case of Harjinder Singh, who is accused of being in the country illegally, to urge the nation's highest court to permanently bar some states from issuing commercial driver's licenses or CDLs to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "In a separate case, another semitruck driver accused of being in the country illegally was charged with the killings of three people in a crash on a southern California freeway this week, renewing federal officials' criticisms of immigrant drivers and concerns about who should be able to obtain CDLs.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Florida's investigation of Harjinder Singh has revealed that the trucker failed a written test to receive a CDL in Washington state 10 times between March 10, 2023, and April 5, 2023, a senior official for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier who was briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press. The official is not authorized to comment publicly about an ongoing investigation and provided the information on the condition of not being identified.",
      "Singh, who is from India, lived in California and was originally issued a CDL in Washington before California also issued him one. He was carrying a valid California CDL at the time of the crash, according to court filings.",
      "A spokesperson for Washington\u2019s Department of Licensing said no one was immediately able to respond to questions Friday. In California, all commercial truck drivers must pass a written test but may be allowed to skip the driving test if they have an out-of-state license with equivalent classification, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicle\u2019s website. State officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for more information.",
      "He is accused of attempting an illegal U-turn from the northbound lanes of Florida\u2019s Turnpike near Fort Pierce on Aug. 12. A minivan that was behind Singh\u2019s big rig couldn\u2019t stop and crashed into the truck, killing its driver and two passengers. Singh and a passenger in the truck were not injured.",
      "Singh is currently being held without bond in the St. Lucie County Jail, not far from where the crash occurred. His next court date is scheduled for Nov. 13.",
      "Florida is now petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to take up its case against the states of California and Washington, and urging the high court to bar states from issuing CDLs to people who are in the country illegally.",
      "Florida's petition filed this month argues the Western states have demonstrated \u201copen defiance of federal immigration laws\" and a failure to enforce public safety, which Florida is urging the court to declare a \u201cpublic nuisance.\" That's a type of legal claim that's typically used to address local concerns like blighted homes, illegal drug-dealing or dangerous animals, but has also been directed at pharmacies for their role in the opioid crisis.",
      "If the court accepts the case, Florida officials hope it could lead to a new legal precedent for states' abilities to issue CDLs to people who are not citizens or legal permanent residents. A ruling could also have a downstream effect on how or if conventional driver's licenses are issued to immigrants, the senior Florida official said.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A yearlong investigation into suspected fraudulent voter registration forms submitted ahead of last year's presidential election produced criminal charges Friday against six street canvassers and the man who led their work in Pennsylvania.",
      "The allegations of fraud appeared to be motivated by the defendants' desire to make money and keep their jobs and was not an effort to influence the election results, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican.",
      "Guillermo Sainz, 33, described by prosecutors as the director of a company's registration drives in Pennsylvania, was charged with three counts of solicitation of registration, a state law that prohibits offering money to reach registration quotas. A message seeking comment was left on a number associated with Sainz, who lives in Arizona. He did not have a lawyer listed in court records.",
      "The six canvassers are charged with unsworn falsification, tampering with public records, forgery and violations of Pennsylvania election law. The charges relate to activities in three Republican-leaning Pennsylvania counties: York, Lancaster and Berks.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,\u201d Sunday said in a news release. Prosecutors said the forms included all party affiliations.",
      "In a court affidavit filed with the criminal charges on Friday, investigators said Sainz, an employee of Field+Media Corps, \"instituted unlawful financial incentives and pressures in his push to meet company goals to maintain funding which in turn spurred some canvassers to create and submit fake forms to earn more money.\"",
      "The chief executive of Field+Media Corps, based in Mesa, Arizona, said last year the company was proud of its work to expand voting but had no information about problematic registration forms. A message seeking comment was left Friday for the CEO, Francisco Heredia. The Field+Media Corps website did not appear to be operative.",
      "Field+Media was funded by Everybody Votes, an effort to improve voter registration rates in communities of color. The affidavit said Everybody Votes \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with the investigation and noted its contract with Field+Media prohibited payments on a per-registration basis.",

      "Sainz, who managed Pennsylvania operations from May to October 2024, is accused of paying canvassers based on how many signatures they collected. The police affidavit said Sainz told agents with the attorney general's office earlier this month he was unaware of any canvassers paid extra hours if they reached a target number of forms.",
      "\u201cSainz had to be asked the question multiple times before he stated he was not aware of this and that \u2018everyone was an hourly worker,\u2019 \" investigators wrote.",
      "One canvasser said she created fake forms to boost her pay and believed others did, too, according to the police affidavit. Another told investigators that most of the registration forms he collected were \u201cnot real.\u201d A third reported that when she realized she was not going to reach a daily quota, \u201cshe would make up names and information,\u201d police wrote, \u201cdue to fear of losing her job.\u201d",
      "The investigation began in late October 2024, when election workers in Lancaster flagged about 2,500 voter registration forms for potential fraud. Authorities said they appeared to contain false names, suspicious handwriting, questionable signatures, incorrect addresses and other problematic details.",
      "The suggestion of criminal activity related to the election came as the battleground state was considered pivotal to the presidential election, and then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the news. At a campaign event, he declared there was \u201ccheating\u201d involving \u201c2,600\u201d votes. The actual issue in Lancaster was about 2,500 suspected fraudulent voter registration forms, not ballots or votes.",

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Over the past three decades, Kenny Chesney has been one of the most celebrated singers in music. In his first book, \"Heart Life Music\" (written with journalist Holly Gleason, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow), Chesney recounts his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which he writes about a soulful collaboration with singer-songwriter Grace Potter \u2013 and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Kenny Chesney on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"Heart Life Music\" by Kenny Chesney with Holly Gleason",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicholas-thompson-on-the-running-ground/",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

Seeing young and old and Black and brown and everything in between step into the theater because they felt that they could be in there, they were represented. They saw themselves, and that was a real shift in my career. I think it was a real shift in where we are in the ballet world today, and it happened that night.\"",

    "summary": "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.",
    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not ineligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The USDA notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through SNAP.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut on Wednesday.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 09:50:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford $2 billion \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts. That's giving us a $2 billion bill. About 20 percent of our global profit is going away in tariffs.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation last month rose at an annual rate of 3%, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

    "story": [
      "German businessman Alexander B\u00f6cker was reading the news with his wife last Sunday when she told him about a robbery at the Louvre in Paris.",
      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany. Everything is produced in Germany, and we are also for safety,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"It was just a world event happening with one of our machines, and we tried to use it. And we really do not want \u2026 anybody to get bad feelings about that. And if so, we are sorry for that.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-cola-2026-increase-cost-of-living-adjustment-inflation/",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:43:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is aimed at helping the program's 75 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday announced a 2.8%\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, an increase that will automatically boost monthly payments for the program's roughly 71 million beneficiaries starting early next year.",
      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",
      "Next year's COLA increase will boost the average Social Security payment by about $56 to an average monthly benefit of $2,071, starting in January, the Social Security Administration said. People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

      "Jill Hornick, a 59-year-old service representative at a Social Security Administration field office in Illinois, would normally have received her latest paycheck on Friday. Instead, she was last paid on Oct. 10 \u2014 for three days less than she had worked.",
      "Hornick is defined as an essential worker and continues to report to the office on a daily basis during the government shutdown. She said she doesn't have time to search for a second job and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",

      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:42:20 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

    "summary": "Unionized baristas will begin voting Friday on whether to authorize a strike amid stalled contract negotiations, Starbucks Workers United said.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 12,000 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, U.S. Treasury Department data shows.",
      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",
      "Impact on consumers",
      "Over time, rising debt hurts consumers by driving up inflation, Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think a lot of people want to know that their kids and grandkids are going to be in good, decent shape in the future \u2014 that they will be able to afford a house,\" said Smetters, who served in President George W. Bush's Treasury Department. \"That additional inflation compounds\" and erodes consumers' purchasing power.",
      "The Trump administration says its efforts to curb government spending will put the country on a better fiscal trajectory. From April to September, the nation's total deficit totaled $468 billion, according to Treasury Department data. In a social media post on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that's the lowest reading since 2019.",
      "\"During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration is working to boost economic growth, lower inflation, and reduce waste and fraud in government spending.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated.",

      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",

      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "summary": "Six in 10 employees say their jobs are falling short on issues including pay, scheduling and career advancement, a new analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",
      "Workplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassment",
      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15.

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",

      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentina-election-results-javier-milei-trump-backed-party-wins/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:44:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei declares himself \"king of a lost world\" after midterms victory aided by massive bailout by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment \u2014 with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.",
      "In the election widely seen as a referendum on self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" Milei's past two years in office, which have included corruption scandals and the scrapping of tens of thousands of public jobs, his right-wing La Libertad Avanza party won more than 40% of the votes, compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.",
      "Milei, a key ideological ally of President Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, three seats short of a congressional majority.",
      "\"I am the king of a lost world,\" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered in downtown Buenos Aires on Sunday. \"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\"",
      "An Argentine legislative election has likely rarely generated so much interest in Washington, or on Wall Street.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank, and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks, on a good showing for Milei in the national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.",
      "\"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Mr. Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.",
      "Those comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms, and analysts predicted a tight midterm race.",
      "To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Then, in an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the international credit line.",
      "In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.",
      "\"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, told The Associated Press. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023.\"",
      "The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the political outsider inherited in late 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump, during a flight to Japan on Monday, said on his Truth Social network that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job.\"",
      "\"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Milei responded to the post, calling the U.S. president \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\"",
      "Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Mr. Trump for his role in helping Milei at the polls.",
      "Kicillof  warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.",
      "\"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\"",
      "Sunday's outcome will test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although his budget cuts have slashed inflation \u2014 from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month \u2014 consumer price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.",
      "The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.",
      "In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.",
      "But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifan\u00eda Contreras, 64, told the AP that she as though she was bearing the brunt of the federal budget cuts.",
      "\"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,\" she said, describing how her monthly pension, worth about $200, has shriveled in value as a result of austerity measures. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\"",
      "More than 250,000 jobs have been lost since Milei came to power, with around 18,000 businesses closing, according to an analysis published this month by the Center for Argentine Political Economy think tank, as the right-wing administration froze investment in infrastructure, health care, education and other social services.",
      "Voting is compulsory for adults in Argentina, but electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% on Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's return to democracy in 1983.",
      "\"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" Mat\u00edas Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate, told the AP. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.\"",

    "summary": "Air traffic controller Jack Criss, a single father, says he's had to make difficult financial decisions to support his family during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Air traffic controller Jack Criss is now clearing takeoffs and takeout orders. The single dad took on a side gig as a DoorDash delivery driver during the second-longest government shutdown in modern history in order to make some extra cash and cover his daughter's high school tuition.",
      "For the past few weeks, air traffic controllers have been receiving partial pay \u2013 but next week, they're expected to miss their first full paychecks as the funding lapse continues.",
      "\"It's been incredibly difficult. You can feel the tension, and it's heavy\u2026and it hurts,\" Criss said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Saturday Mornings.\"",
      "As the government shutdown rolls into Day 25, Congress remains unable to strike a deal. The Senate failed to advance measuresThursday that would pay federal employees like Criss.",
      "\"It is hard enough just going to work. Now, when you add\u2026not getting paid, that's when you just like multiply the level of pressure. And you know, air traffic is a safety sensitive position,\" Criss said. \"The margin of error is zero. So if you think about it as pressure on top of pressure, when you don't know exactly when you'll get paid based on politics.\"",
      "Criss said he has tapped into his retirement funds and taken out a high-interest, short-term loan to make sure he has the cash to weather a lengthy shutdown.",
      "While Criss has continued to clock into work, the Department of Transportation reports that it's seen an uptick in sick calls from controllers, causing staffing shortages at some airports.",
      "\"Safety is paramount for us and so if we don't have the staffing levels in a tower, TRACON or center, you will see us delay traffic; you will see us cancel flights,\" U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.",
      "Duffy has discouraged air traffic controllers from taking on side hustles to focus on their already demanding positions.",
      "\"Well, I don't want my air traffic controllers to take a second job \u2014 I want them to do one job. I don't want them delivering for DoorDash, I don't want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities, and controlling the air space,\" Duffy said Thursday at the House GOP's press conference, though he acknowledged the financial stress workers are facing to \"feed their kids and support their family members.\"",
      "But Criss says there's no way around it for struggling workers like himself. Even with the extra income from DoorDash he was \"not even close\" to covering his daughter's tuition bill.",
      "Criss shared his story with lawmakers at a televised town hall last week. After hearing his story, DoorDash reached out to offer the essential worker $10,000 to help pay for his daughter's education. If the money comes, Criss said it would be a huge help \u2013 but it still may not be enough to give up his new side job.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. warship docked in\u00a0Trinidad and Tobago's capital on Sunday as the Trump administration boosts its military pressure on neighboring Venezuela and President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The arrival of the USS Gravely, a guided missile destroyer, in the capital of the Caribbean nation joins the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is moving closer to Venezuela. Maduro criticized the movement of the carrier as an attempt by the U.S government to fabricate \"a new eternal war\" against his country.",
      "The Venezuelan government on Sunday denounced the presence of the destroyer, calling it a \"hostile provocation against Venezuela and a serious threat to the peace of the Caribbean,\" and accused the U.S. of preparing to launch a false flag attack.",
      "\"Venezuela reports that it has captured a mercenary group with direct information from the U.S. intelligence agency, CIA, being able to determine that a false flag attack is underway from waters bordering Trinidad and Tobago, or from Trinidad or Venezuelan territory itself,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "President\u00a0Trump has accused Maduro, without providing evidence, of being the leader of the organized crime gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, \"We are involved in a counterdrug operation. The president has made this very clear.\"",
      "Government officials from Trinidad and Tobago and the U.S. said the massive warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so both countries can carry out training exercises.",
      "A senior military official in Trinidad and Tobago told The Associated Press that the move was only recently scheduled. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, has been a vocal supporter of the U.S. military presence and the deadly strikes on suspected drug boats in waters off Venezuela. The wife of\u00a0Alejandro Carranza, one of the more than 30 people killed in the strikes, claimed he left home on Colombia's Caribbean coast to fish in open waters and denied he had any link to drug trafficking.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has said\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "Rubio said Sunday that countries like Trinidad and Tobago cooperate with the U.S.'s drug operations, but, \"We have no drug cooperation with the regime in Venezuela, primarily because they're not legitimate and because they're part of it. They're part of the drug operation.\"",
      "In an interview aired Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said land strikes in Venezuela are a \"real possibility\" amid rising tensions.",
      "\"I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go. That Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco terrorists for too long,\" the Republican senator told Margaret Brennan. \"And President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.\"",
      "Venezuela's government said Sunday, \"By bending to Washington's militarist agenda, Persad-Bissessar not only intends to attack Venezuela ... and break our historical bonds of brotherhood, but also violates the Charter of the United Nations, the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Peace Zone approved by CELAC and the principles of CARICOM.\"",
      "\"Venezuela does not accept threats from any U.S. vassal government,\" the country's government added. \"We are not intimidated by military exercises or war cries.\"",
      "U.S. Embassy Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires Jenifer Neidhart de Ortiz said in a statement that the exercises seek to \"address shared threats like transnational crime and build resilience through training, humanitarian missions, and security efforts.\"",
      "The visit comes one week after the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago warned Americans to stay away from U.S. government facilities there. Local authorities said a reported threat against Americans prompted the warning.",
      "People in Trinidad and Tobago have criticize the warship's docking in town at a recent demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy.\u00a0 David Abdulah, the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party, said Trinidad and Tobago should not have allowed the warship into its waters.",
      "\"This is a warship in Trinidad, which will be anchored here for several days just miles off Venezuela when there's a threat of war,\" said Abdulah, who is also the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party. \"That's an abomination.\"",
      "Caricom, a regional trade bloc made up of 15 Caribbean countries, has called for dialogue. Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the group, but Persad-Bissessar has said the region is not a zone of peace, citing the number of murders and other violent crimes.",

      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, he came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",

      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Kim. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",

      "\"I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not \u2014 it wouldn't be right.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Mr. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.",
      "On Air Force One, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't really thought about it.\"",
      "He praised Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. \"I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,\" he said.",
      "South China Sea, Taiwan, and tariffs",
      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",

      "A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.",
      "The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its\u00a0purchases of Russian oil with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.",
      "When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, \"I think a complete deal.\"",
      "\"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We're going to be talking about fentanyl,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday. \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.\"",
      "During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country's emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation.",
      "Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing \"peace to the Middle East,\" after they served as intermediaries during the Israel-Hamas peace deal, calling them a \"great ally.\"",
      "His trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.",
      "\"America is shut down and the President is skipping town,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "On Sunday, he's scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia.",
      "\"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit.",
      "\"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.",
      "From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%.",
      "The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.",
      "Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was \"a good sign\" and \"I look forward to meeting her.\"",
      "While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip.",
      "In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China's Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.",
      "While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The meeting follows months of volatile moves in a trade war\u00a0between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Seneca, South Carolina. Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator--",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, Defense Secretary Hegseth ordered the deployment of the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, to Latin America. President Trump was asked if he planned to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK. We're going to kill them. You know, they're going to be, like, dead.",
      "[SOUNDS OF TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't need an aircraft carrier to hit drug boats are land strikes planned?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think that's a real possibility. I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug, drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go, that Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long, and President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia. So there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land. I support that idea, but I think he has all the authority he needs. Senator Gallego, on another network, accused President Trump and our military of committing murder by attacking these drug boats. To our men and women in uniform, you're not murdering anybody. You're making America safer by going after a narco-terrorist. You're following lawful orders. When President Bush, 41, took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence from Grenada in our backyard, he has all the authority in the world. This is not murder. This is protecting America from being poisoned by narco-terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot there. But just to clarify the examples you're citing, also involved ground troops. You said time for Maduro to go. That sounds a lot like regime change. Are you talking about troops on the ground?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I'll let the President speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has been robustly applied by President Trump. So these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia. So I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Well, there's a lot there, sir, but you cited a Democratic senator's criticism. He's not the only one. Some of your Republican colleagues have been uncomfortable with what little information has been shared with Congress. Take a listen:",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: If they want all out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out that has to have a declaration of war. It's something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but the Congress should vote. And the President shouldn't do this by himself.",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: If this was happening with this level of insight under the Biden administration, I'd be apoplectic.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Todd Young also criticized this, what exactly is the end game? Because you're talking about regime change in Venezuela, the President says this is about drug boats.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America, that the narco-terrorist dictator Maduro no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans. As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamental with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country. Reagan didn't have a declaration of war congressional authorization to deal with Cuban influence. So this idea- Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with. To the other senators, you deserve more information, and you're going to get more information, but there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander-in-chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard, where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force. We looked at the JAG manual: preventative self defense employed to counter non imminent threats is illegal under international law. So if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what man you're referring to, but I know what President Bush, 41 did. He took down Ortega [sic], the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking threatening our country. Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's not new.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela. No, it should have stopped. Here's what, here's what's new. You got a commander-in-chief's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America, and we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country, because they house Narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts. So yeah, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force like we have in the past to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game, and if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before heat goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article, Article Two powers of the President are designed to protect our countries from threats foreign and domestic. Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway? There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing. But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking, drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier. Sorry. I want to come back to you said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders. Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander-in-chief. There have been other departures as well. This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence, to assure them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's that's garbage, that's absolute garbage\u2013",
      "(Crosstalk)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which that Hegseth said that?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, no. I'm saying that- the theory that President Trump's doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer. It's the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada. Yeah, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing. More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who's going to use the full force of, of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President, we're not committing murder. We're protecting our nation from people who want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well yeah, we'll deal with both. We'll deal with both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I want to come back to\u2013 when we talk about lawful orders here, I myself spoke to a former senior commander who said he'd want that in writing because of concern that, that this is going to be down the line questionable.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What in writing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've already heard the orders to carry out operations. You've already heard Democratic lawmakers, including on this program, say that they have concerns about future prosecutions of officers.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well act on your concerns. Why don't you- Why don't you- Okay, if you've got concerns, here's what we can do as members of Congress. We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So if you're concerned as a Democrat or Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug votes and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do it. I'll vote no. I think it has all the authority in the world under Article Two and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country. It's not a, I think it has all the legal authority in the world. I'm just really glad he's doing this and Mr. President, keep it up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look forward to hearing those justifications when they are shared with Congress. You made some news there, Senator. Thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",
      "Editor's Note: A previous version of this transcript mistakenly attributed a quote to Sen. Todd Young instead of Sen. James Lankford. The text has been updated.",
      "Editor's note: The George H.W. Bush administration carried out a land invasion in Panama in 1989 that removed Manuel Noriega from power, not Daniel Ortega.",

      "As the U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against Venezuelan and Colombian vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean that the Trump administration has accused of carrying drugs and cartel members, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that land strikes in Venezuela \u2014 a significant escalation \u2014 are a \"real possibility.\"",

      "Mr. Trump suggested last week that land strikes are \"going to be next,\" saying on Thursday that \"the drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago\" due to the strikes. Mr. Trump did not offer any evidence to back up this claim, and members of Congress have also said the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the targeted vessels are carrying drugs.",
      "As of Friday, at least 43 people have been killed in the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that have occurred on 10 vessels since Sept. 2. Last week, the Colombian government called on the U.S.\u00a0 \"to respect the norms dictated by international law\" and cease the strikes.",
      "Graham on Sunday said there will be a Congressional briefing on land strikes, not an invasion, although he also called for the removal of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Graham repeatedly cited former President George H.W. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989, saying the Bush administration didn't receive Congressional approval for that mission.",
      "\"Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country,\" Graham said.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states, including a visit this past July to South Carolina, which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats. The goal, according to the Justice Department, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "While Newsom has long been a fixture in California, his foray into presidential politics generated intense interest last year when he was a fierce defender of President Joe Biden, especially in the wake of Biden's debate performance against Mr. Trump, which prompted many Democrats to call for Biden to exit the 2024 race.",
      "Newsom, however, never wavered on Biden's candidacy. In the days before Biden dropped out of the race, Newsom stumped for him nationwide, including in New Hampshire.",
      "Speaking with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" there in July 2024, about a week before Biden left the race, Newsom said he was \"all in\" on Biden.",
      "\"No daylight,\" Newsom said of his alliance with Biden at the time.",
      "According to sources close to both Newsom and Biden, the two men are close and have stayed in touch since Biden left the White House. Newsom is also friendly with former President Barack Obama, who has offered support for Proposition 50 and joined Newsom and volunteers on a video call last week.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that service members will miss paychecks by Nov. 15 if the government shutdown stretches on, despite the Trump administration's previous assurances that members of the military will be paid amid the funding lapse.",
      "\"I think we'll be able to pay them beginning in November, but by Nov. 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump directed the Pentagon to use unspent research and development funds to pay the military earlier this month, with around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year identified to cover the mid-month paychecks. But officials have warned that the move was a temporary fix, and that members of the military risked missing their next paychecks at the end of the month, and beyond, if the shutdown continues.",
      "Bessent suggested that members of the military will receive their upcoming paycheck, but he warned that if the shutdown continues, the U.S. would be unable to pay the service members by mid-November.",
      "\"What an embarrassment,\" Bessent said, putting the blame on Democratic leaders in Congress who he claimed are \"worried about their primaries, and not the American people.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans have been locked in a stalemate over how to fund the government for weeks as Democrats have demanded an extension of health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. Meanwhile, Republicans have been clear that they are willing to discuss the health care issue, but only once the government reopens, despite Democrats' repeated requests for negotiations.",
      "Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the president and leaders in Congress after a request from Democrats last week, Bessent said \"I don't know what good it does.\"",
      "\"This is a Democratic-led boycott, and I'm just not sure what they're doing,\" Bessent added.",
      "The treasury secretary warned that the shutdown is \"starting to affect the economy,\" urging moderate Democrats to \"be heroes\" by breaking with their party to vote in favor of the House-passed measure to reopen the government that has fallen short of the 60 votes needed a dozen times in the Senate.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said \"there is an urgent need to reopen the government.\"",
      "\"Which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said. \"That's what we've called for from the very beginning.\"",

      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by early November in a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump warned that the tariffs would take effect if Beijing couldn't reach a deal with the U.S., citing new Chinese export controls. But after the meetings, Bessent said he expects \"the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime.\"",
      "The treasury secretary praised Mr. Trump for giving him and his team an advantage, saying the threat of a 100% additional tariff \"did give us a great deal of leverage\".",
      "\"President Trump's very good at creating leverage for us,\" Bessent added.",
      "At the trade meetings, Bessent said he and his Chinese counterpart discussed \"a wide variety of issues,\" from rare-earth magnets to purchases of American agricultural products to the Chinese helping combat the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. He also said the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday when President Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "\"We reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last month that paved the way for a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors. But the details were not immediately clear. Asked about the details of the TikTok transaction Sunday, Bessent said he is \"not part of the commercial side of the transaction.\"",
      "\"My remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days,\" he said",
      "Bessent spoke from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Xi at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping had signed off on the deal during a call. The deal represented a \"qualified divestiture,\" satisfying a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that required TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban. The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app's operations in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "The White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based \"joint venture\" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said \"as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reason for distrust.\"",
      "When asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, \"I'm still concerned about it.\"",
      "\"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get,\" Moolenaar said. \"But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.\"",

    "summary": "Since September, the U.S. has been carrying out strikes on alleged drug cartel boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has been carrying out intermittent strikes on vessels alleged to be carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September.",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war.

    "summary": "The Justice Department is preparing to send election observers to California and New Jersey next month, following requests from their state Republican parties.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.",
      "The department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.",
      "The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"",
      "Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"",
      "The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.",
      "\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.",
      "The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.",
      "Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.",
      "California is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.",
      "Election integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a\u00a02020 lawsuit\u00a0on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.",
      "\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.",
      "Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"",
      "Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.",
      "\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.",
      "Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks \u2014 and sometimes longer.",
      "In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.",
      "California's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.",
      "The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.",
      "The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.",
      "In 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson \u2014 the largest city in Passaic County \u2014 after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.",
      "Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"",
      "Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.",
      "Last year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.",
      "David Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor  who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.",
      "But Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.",
      "If the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Murray cod, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream towards home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. \u00a0It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery has signaled that it may be open to a sale of its business just months after announcing plans to split into two companies.",
      "In an announcement Tuesday, the entertainment giant said it had initiated a review of \"strategic alternatives\" in light of \"unsolicited interest\" it had received from \"multiple parties\" for both the entire company and Warner Bros specifically.",
      "\"Through this process, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board will evaluate a broad range of strategic options, which will include continuing to advance the Company's planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses,\" it said.",
      "Warner Bros. in recent weeks rejected a bid from Paramount Skydance, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News\u00a0and other media outlets (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News).",
      "Warner Bros.' stock price jumped in early trading, rising nearly 10% to $20.12. The shares have climbed 91% this year, especially in recent weeks as speculation has grown on Wall Street that the company was in play.",
      "The company's market value on Tuesday hovered around $49 billion, and Wall Street analysts estimate that the price of any deal to buy Warner Bros. would likely top $60 billion.",
      "Split or sell?",
      "In June, Warner Bros. announced that it planned to split into two companies by mid-2026, one focusing on streaming and films, and the other housing TV services/channels brands including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav said Tuesday that the restructuring remains on track.",
      "\"We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward,\" Zaslav said in a statement.",
      "Still, he added, \"it's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market.\"",
      "Equity analysts with MoffettNathanson said potential bidders for all or parts of Warner Bros include Paramount Skydance, Comcast and Sony. Tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix, all of which produce streaming content, are less likely to explore a deal, according to the the investment advisory firm.",
      "\"[W]e do expect the demand for Warner Bros. streaming and studio to command a premium multiple,\" the analysts said in a note to investors. \"Whether multiple bidders emerge for just these assets will likely determine if the price can reach levels high enough to move forward with this alternative plan.\"",

    "summary": "An Amazon Web Services outage impacting Amazon's own services and as well as apps around the world wasn't resolved until Monday evening.`",
    "story": [
      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",
      "Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services.",
      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said.",

    "summary": "Bethel Friends of Canines\u200b has been working with pilots and others to rescue dogs left behind when remote villages in Alaska were hit by high surf and strong winds.",
    "story": [
      "A nonprofit organization in Alaska has rescued at least 180 dogs \u2014 and a turtle \u2014 after flooding devastated several remote villages in Alaska earlier this month.",
      "Hundreds of people were airlifted out of the villages\u00a0that were hit by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, but many dogs had to be left behind. The villages, most on the western coast of Alaska, have no road access, which means everything needs to flown in and out, including pets.",
      "That has been the biggest challenge for Bethel Friends of Canines, or BFK9, as the organization continues rescues, said Jenna Stewart, the nonprofit's director of development. BFK9, which started as an animal rescue in 2011, is based in Bethel, Alaska, a hub for the villages in the region.",
      "\"We are thankful to have so many pilots and airlines that help us,\" Stewart said in an email. \"It is hard for people outside of Alaska, and even some in Alaska, to fathom not being able to just drive and save these dogs.\"",
      "BFK9, which typically takes in about 500 animals a year, has also gotten help from some people who stayed behind. In Kipnuk, one of the hard-hit villages, a group of teachers and others rounded up dogs to transfer to the rescuers, who arrived with airline kennels.",
      "\"The first dogs they sent in to us arrived in a plastic tote and a couple puppies in a Spiderman backpack,\" Stewart said. \"They had nothing else to hold these dogs, but knew they had to get out of the Village and to safety with BFK9.\"",
      "While nearly all the rescues are of dogs, the group also rescued its first turtle \u2014 a red-eared slider turtle that was a classroom pet in one of the villages.",
      "\"The turtle is now in Bethel with a local veterinarian,\" Stewart said.",
      "The group will take in cats as well, but there aren't many in rural Alaska, Steward said. They usually only get three to five cats a year, she said.",
      "After BFK9 gets the dogs to Bethel, they work to reunite them with their families.",
      "\"These Villages are pretty small, which means usually everyone knows everyone's dog,\" Stewart said.",
      "If a dog's owner is unknown, the group posts pictures on its Facebook page. Foster homes are also available if owners can't take their dogs right away.",
      "As of Friday, BFK9 was still getting information about more dogs that needed rescuing. \"A lot of these dogs left out there are the scared ones. They are so scared, and so confused and are hiding,\" Stewart said.",
      "\"This ordeal is far from over,\" she said.",
      "BFK9 has partnered with other groups, including the Humane World of Animals, Best Friends Animal Rescue and the August Fund in Anchorage, to help rescue and hold the dogs while they wait to be reunited.",
      "The nonprofit has received donations and support from people across Alaska and around the country.",
      "\"Bethel Friends of Canines has an incredible Village. We are doing great things, but we couldn't do it without all the people helping us,\" Stewart said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not ineligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

      "Melissa strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane early Monday and was forecast to bring \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash flooding and landslides\u00a0to Jamaica, the southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic and to eastern Cuba over the next few days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "As of 11 a.m. ET, Melissa was packing winds of 165 mph. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it's turning into the strongest Atlantic system this season.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "In the hurricane center's 11 a.m. ET update, Melissa's center was about 145 miles southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 330 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, Maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 165 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 195 miles. It was crawling west at 3 mph.",
      "\"The core of Melissa is expected to move over Jamaica tonight and Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecasters said the storm's intensity would likely fluctuate ahead of its landfall. But, they added, \"Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely powerful major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.\"",
      "When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves are forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 6 to 9 feet in Cuba.",
      "The storm's slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said Monday. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica over the next 36 hours.\"",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said. It killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",

For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 15 inches, with as much as 20 inches in some spots today into Wednesday, the center added.",

      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut on Wednesday.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

Mr. Trump is expected to meet with China's president at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, and tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by early November in a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump warned that the tariffs would take effect if Beijing couldn't reach a deal with the U.S., citing new Chinese export controls. But after the meetings, Bessent said he expects \"the threat of the 100% has gone away, as has the threat of the immediate imposition of the Chinese initiating a worldwide export control regime.\"",
      "The treasury secretary praised Mr. Trump for giving him and his team an advantage, saying the threat of a 100% additional tariff \"did give us a great deal of leverage\".",

The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app's operations in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "The White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based \"joint venture\" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said \"as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there's reason for distrust.\"",
      "When asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, \"I'm still concerned about it.\"",
      "\"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get,\" Moolenaar said. \"But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Since September, the U.S. has been carrying out strikes on alleged drug cartel boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has been carrying out intermittent strikes on vessels alleged to be carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September.",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Democrats and some Republicans in Congress worry the strikes could lead to a larger conflict in the Caribbean. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he wonders why U.S. leaders \"would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are.\" He says he wants to force a vote with a bipartisan group of senators to block the president from military action in the region unless explicitly authorized by Congress.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats ineffective, since the strikes are largely targeting alleged lower-level smugglers.",
      "\"You have to capture the bosses,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "What else is the Trump administration doing to combat drug trafficking from Latin America?",
      "The Pentagon said on Oct. 24 that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's campaign to counter narcotics traffickers.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department is preparing to send election observers to California and New Jersey next month, following requests from their state Republican parties.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.",
      "The department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.",
      "The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"",
      "Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"",
      "The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.",
      "\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.",
      "The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.",
      "Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.",
      "California is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.",
      "Election integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a\u00a02020 lawsuit\u00a0on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.",
      "\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.",
      "Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"",
      "Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.",
      "\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.",
      "Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks \u2014 and sometimes longer.",
      "In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.",
      "California's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.",
      "The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.",
      "The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.",
      "In 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson \u2014 the largest city in Passaic County \u2014 after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.",
      "Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"",
      "Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.",
      "Last year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.",
      "David Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor  who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.",
      "But Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.",
      "If the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Murray cod, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream towards home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. \u00a0It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

The storm is forecast to dump up to 30 inches of rain on Jamaica, along with life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast.",
      "Melissa is expected to make landfall on the island Monday night and Tuesday and cross southeastern Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday.",
      "On Monday morning, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 165 mph and was inching west at a slow pace, just 3 mph, the center said. Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, for storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph \u2014 catastrophic strength capable of destroying many of the homes in its path.",
      "\"Destructive winds and storm surge and catastrophic flooding will worsen on Jamaica through the day and into tonight,\" CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan stressed.",
      "Melissa is expected to be the most powerful storm to ever hit Jamaica, and, potentially, the most powerful storm on record to ever make landfall anywhere, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said on Monday. The storm's slow pace, which it was forecast to maintain while traversing Jamaica, increased the likelihood that it would bring \"profound\" devastation to the island, according to Gilmore.",
      "\"All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica over the next 36 hours,\" he said.",

      "The hurricane was expected to make another landfall later Tuesday in eastern Cuba.

Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.",
      "Around 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ahead of Melissa's arrival, a U.S. defense official told CBS News. Meanwhile, some U.S. Navy ships in the region were repositioned out of the hurricane's direct path but remained actively deployed, the official said.",
      "Melissa could be the strongest hurricane Jamaica has experienced in decades, said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service. He warned that cleanup and damage assessment would be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.",
      "\"Don't make foolish decisions,\" warned Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's transport minister. \"We are in a very, very serious time over the next few days.\"",
      "The storm has already dropped heavy rain in the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.",
      "Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the Dominican Republic, displacing more than 3,760 people. Floodwaters have also cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.",
      "In Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 37 acres of maize, at a time when at least 5.7 million people, more than half the country's population, are experiencing crisis-level hunger, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency-level hunger.",
      "\"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,\" the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said.",
      "Melissa was expected to keep dumping torrential rain over southern Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic in the upcoming days.",

    "story": [
      "Melissa strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane early Monday and was forecast to bring \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash flooding and landslides\u00a0to Jamaica, the southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic and to eastern Cuba over the next few days, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "As of 11 a.m. ET, Melissa was packing winds of 165 mph. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Hurricane Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it's turning into the strongest Atlantic system this season.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "In the hurricane center's 11 a.m. ET update, Melissa's center was about 145 miles southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and about 330 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, Maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 165 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extending 195 miles. It was crawling west at 3 mph.",
      "\"The core of Melissa is expected to move over Jamaica tonight and Tuesday, across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecasters said the storm's intensity would likely fluctuate ahead of its landfall. But, they added, \"Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely powerful major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.\"",
      "When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves are forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 6 to 9 feet in Cuba.",
      "The storm's slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said Monday. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica over the next 36 hours.\"",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said. It killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin.",

For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 15 inches, with as much as 20 inches in some spots today into Wednesday, the center added.",
      "\"Over the Southeast Bahamas, total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding.\"",
      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica,\" forecasters said.",
      "Additional heavy rainfall is likely beyond Tuesday, the hurricane center said, but uncertainty remains about the more extended forecast.",

Red Cross personnel accompanied Hamas operatives as they conducted the expanded search operations on Sunday, the international organization confirmed on Monday.",
      "A convoy of trucks and heavy equipment, including an excavator and bulldozers, entered southern Gaza overnight, part of efforts by international mediators to shore up the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, two Egyptian officials told the Associated Press, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",

      "Under the fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire, reached on Oct. 10, Hamas is expected to return all of the remains of Israeli hostages as soon as possible. Israel agreed to return 15 bodies of deceased Palestinians for every body of a hostage that is returned.",
      "Thus far, Hamas has returned 18 bodies of hostages, but in the past five days, it has failed to release any remains. Israel has sent back the bodies of 195 Palestinians to Gaza.",
      "Hamas' leader in Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, said the group had begun searching new areas to find the 13 Israeli hostages' bodies that remain in the Palestinian territory, according to comments shared by the group early Sunday.",
      "President Trump warned on Saturday that he was \"watching very closely\" to ensure Hamas returns more bodies within the next 48 hours. \"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",

      "The RSF forces have encircled El-Fasher for weeks, building an earthen berm around the city to stop supplies getting in and people getting out. It is the last remaining stronghold of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region, and if the RSF does fully capture El-Fasher, it would leave the group in control of all five of Darfur's states.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentina-election-results-javier-milei-trump-backed-party-wins/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:44:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei declares himself \"king of a lost world\" after midterms victory aided by massive bailout by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment \u2014 with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.",
      "In the election widely seen as a referendum on self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" Milei's past two years in office, which have included corruption scandals and the scrapping of tens of thousands of public jobs, his right-wing La Libertad Avanza party won more than 40% of the votes, compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.",
      "Milei, a key ideological ally of President Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, three seats short of a congressional majority.",
      "\"I am the king of a lost world,\" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered in downtown Buenos Aires on Sunday. \"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\"",
      "An Argentine legislative election has likely rarely generated so much interest in Washington, or on Wall Street.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank, and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks, on a good showing for Milei in the national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.",
      "\"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Mr. Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.",
      "Those comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms, and analysts predicted a tight midterm race.",
      "To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Then, in an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the international credit line.",
      "In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.",
      "\"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, told The Associated Press. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023.\"",
      "The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the political outsider inherited in late 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump, during a flight to Japan on Monday, said on his Truth Social network that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job.\"",
      "\"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Milei responded to the post, calling the U.S. president \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\"",
      "Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Mr. Trump for his role in helping Milei at the polls.",
      "Kicillof  warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.",
      "\"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\"",
      "Sunday's outcome will test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although his budget cuts have slashed inflation \u2014 from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month \u2014 consumer price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.",
      "The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.",
      "In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.",
      "But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifan\u00eda Contreras, 64, told the AP that she as though she was bearing the brunt of the federal budget cuts.",
      "\"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,\" she said, describing how her monthly pension, worth about $200, has shriveled in value as a result of austerity measures. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\"",
      "More than 250,000 jobs have been lost since Milei came to power, with around 18,000 businesses closing, according to an analysis published this month by the Center for Argentine Political Economy think tank, as the right-wing administration froze investment in infrastructure, health care, education and other social services.",
      "Voting is compulsory for adults in Argentina, but electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% on Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's return to democracy in 1983.",
      "\"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" Mat\u00edas Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate, told the AP. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.\"",

    "summary": "In an interview aired Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said land strikes in Venezuela are a \"real possibility\" amid rising tensions.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. warship docked in\u00a0Trinidad and Tobago's capital on Sunday as the Trump administration boosts its military pressure on neighboring Venezuela and President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The arrival of the USS Gravely, a guided missile destroyer, in the capital of the Caribbean nation joins the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is moving closer to Venezuela. Maduro criticized the movement of the carrier as an attempt by the U.S government to fabricate \"a new eternal war\" against his country.",
      "The Venezuelan government on Sunday denounced the presence of the destroyer, calling it a \"hostile provocation against Venezuela and a serious threat to the peace of the Caribbean,\" and accused the U.S. of preparing to launch a false flag attack.",
      "\"Venezuela reports that it has captured a mercenary group with direct information from the U.S. intelligence agency, CIA, being able to determine that a false flag attack is underway from waters bordering Trinidad and Tobago, or from Trinidad or Venezuelan territory itself,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "President\u00a0Trump has accused Maduro, without providing evidence, of being the leader of the organized crime gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, \"We are involved in a counterdrug operation. The president has made this very clear.\"",
      "Government officials from Trinidad and Tobago and the U.S. said the massive warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so both countries can carry out training exercises.",
      "A senior military official in Trinidad and Tobago told The Associated Press that the move was only recently scheduled. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, has been a vocal supporter of the U.S. military presence and the deadly strikes on suspected drug boats in waters off Venezuela. The wife of\u00a0Alejandro Carranza, one of the more than 30 people killed in the strikes, claimed he left home on Colombia's Caribbean coast to fish in open waters and denied he had any link to drug trafficking.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has said\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "Rubio said Sunday that countries like Trinidad and Tobago cooperate with the U.S.'s drug operations, but, \"We have no drug cooperation with the regime in Venezuela, primarily because they're not legitimate and because they're part of it. They're part of the drug operation.\"",
      "In an interview aired Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said land strikes in Venezuela are a \"real possibility\" amid rising tensions.",
      "\"I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go. That Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco terrorists for too long,\" the Republican senator told Margaret Brennan. \"And President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.\"",
      "Venezuela's government said Sunday, \"By bending to Washington's militarist agenda, Persad-Bissessar not only intends to attack Venezuela ... and break our historical bonds of brotherhood, but also violates the Charter of the United Nations, the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Peace Zone approved by CELAC and the principles of CARICOM.\"",
      "\"Venezuela does not accept threats from any U.S. vassal government,\" the country's government added. \"We are not intimidated by military exercises or war cries.\"",
      "U.S. Embassy Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires Jenifer Neidhart de Ortiz said in a statement that the exercises seek to \"address shared threats like transnational crime and build resilience through training, humanitarian missions, and security efforts.\"",
      "The visit comes one week after the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago warned Americans to stay away from U.S. government facilities there. Local authorities said a reported threat against Americans prompted the warning.",
      "People in Trinidad and Tobago have criticize the warship's docking in town at a recent demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy.\u00a0 David Abdulah, the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party, said Trinidad and Tobago should not have allowed the warship into its waters.",
      "\"This is a warship in Trinidad, which will be anchored here for several days just miles off Venezuela when there's a threat of war,\" said Abdulah, who is also the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party. \"That's an abomination.\"",
      "Caricom, a regional trade bloc made up of 15 Caribbean countries, has called for dialogue. Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the group, but Persad-Bissessar has said the region is not a zone of peace, citing the number of murders and other violent crimes.",

    "summary": "Lithuania accuses Belarus and Russia of a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare\" as balloons shut down major airport.",
    "story": [
      "The government of Lithuania, which is a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, said Monday that it will start shooting down unidentified balloons that enter the country's airspace, after a number of them allegedly launched from neighboring Belarus forced the repeated closure of a major airport.",
      "Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned Monday that any further balloons detected would be shot down after operations at Vilnius International Airport, which serves the capital city, were halted a total of four times last week.",
      "\"Today we have decided to take the strictest measures, there is no other way,\" Ruginiene told journalists, according to Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT, calling the incidents \"hybrid attacks\" and saying her country could discuss invoking the collective defense clause in the founding NATO treaty over the incidents.",
      "Article 4 can be invoked by any NATO member that feels its security is at risk, which would spark talks among the allies to discuss the threat. Article 4 has been invoked nine times in NATO's history, three of which related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Lithuania believes smugglers use the balloons to transport contraband cigarettes over the border, but it has criticized Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, for not clamping down.",
      "\"Inaction is also an action,\" Ruginiene said after a meeting of her country's National Security Commission on Monday. \"If Belarus does nothing about it and does not fight, we also assess these actions accordingly.\"",
      "Ruginiene added that her government would indefinitely close its land border with Belarus, apart from for diplomats and returning European Union nationals, according to LRT.",
      "\"This is how we send a signal to Belarus and say that no hybrid attack will be tolerated here, we will take all the strictest measures to stop such attacks,\" she said.",
      "\"Our response will determine how far autocrats dare to go,\" Ruginiene's office said in a statement sent later Monday to CBS News.",
      "There was no immediate comment on the incident from officials in Belarus.",
      "Many of America's European allies have had their airspace breached in recent weeks, mostly by unclaimed drones sighted around airports and military facilities in Germany, Denmark and the Baltic states. Estonia also accused Russian fighter jets of flying through its airspace for 12 minutes in mid-September.",
      "Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said Monday in a post on social media that NATO was facing a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare from Russia and its proxy, Belarus,\" calling the spate of recent airspace incursions, \"calculated provocations designed to destabilize, distract and test NATO's resolve.\"",
      "He called for further sanctions against Belarus and stronger NATO security measures to deter the airspace violations.",
      "On October 23, a Russian Sukhoi SU-30 fighter and an IL-78 tanker plane flew just under half of a mile into Lithuanian territory, according to the country's ministry of foreign affairs, after departing from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The Baltic Sea coastal territory is separate from the rest of Russia, and bordered on two sides by Lithuania and Poland.",
      "Two days before that, several \"meteorological balloons\" launched from Belarus were detected by Lithuanian radar systems in the country's airspace, disrupting travel at Vilnius' airport, the foreign ministry said.",
      "Lithuania summoned the top Belorussian diplomat in the country on October 22 to voice a \"strong protest regarding the repeated and increasingly frequent violations\" of its airspace, warning the Russian ally that Vilnius \"reserves the right to take appropriate retaliatory measures.\"",
      "Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center said earlier this month that at least 544 balloons had already entered Lithuanian airspace this year, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News. The center said 966 such balloon incursions were recorded during 2024.",
      "\"Last year we were blind chickens and didn't see many things,\" Ruginiene said Monday. \"Thank God, there was no catastrophe. We didn't see certain moving objects, so there were no decisions to close the airspace.\"",
      "\"Today we have much better equipment, we can see much more information,\" she said, according to LRT. \"We believe that we need to take action to protect our citizens.\"",

      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, he came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",

      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Kim. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",

      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uncontacted-indigenous-tribes-report-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:15:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Loggers were killed after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru's Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
    "story": [
      "From the depths of Brazil's Amazon to Indonesia's rainforests, some of the world's most isolated peoples are being squeezed by roads, miners and drug traffickers \u2014 a crisis unfolding far from public view or effective state protection.",
      "A new report by Survival International, a London-based Indigenous rights organization, attempts one of the broadest tallies yet, identifying at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups in 10 countries, primarily in the South American nations sharing the Amazon rainforest. Released Sunday, the report estimates that nearly 65% face threats from logging, about 40% from mining and around 20% from agribusiness.",
      "\"These are what I would call silent genocides - there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they're happening now,\" said Fiona Watson, Survival's research and advocacy director, who has worked on Indigenous rights for more than three decades.",
      "The issue often receives little priority from governments, which critics say see uncontacted peoples as politically marginal because they don't vote and their territories are often coveted for logging, mining and oil extraction. Public debate is also shaped by stereotypes - some romanticize them as \"lost tribes,\" while others view them as barriers to development.",
      "Survival's research concludes that half of these groups \"could be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act.\"",
      "Who the uncontacted peoples are",
      "Uncontacted peoples are not \"lost tribes\" frozen in time, Watson said. They are contemporary societies that deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease.",
      "\"They don't need anything from us,\" Watson said. \"They're happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing - essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\"",
      "Survival's research shows that more than 95% of the world's uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These communities live by hunting, fishing and small-scale cultivation, maintaining languages and traditions that predate modern nation-states.",
      "Why contact can be deadly",
      "Groups living in voluntary isolation have \"minimal to no contact with those outside of their own group,\" said Dr. Subhra Bhattacharjee, director general of the Forest Stewardship Council and an Indigenous rights expert based in Bonn, Germany. \"A simple cold that you and I recover from in a week \u2026 they could die of that cold.\"",
      "Beyond disease, contact can destroy livelihoods and belief systems. International law requires free, prior and informed consent - known as FPIC - before any activity on Indigenous lands.",
      "\"But when you have groups living in voluntary isolation, who you cannot get close to without risking their lives, you cannot get FPIC,\" Bhattacharjee said. \"No FPIC means no consent.\"",
      "Her organization follows a strict policy: \"No contact, no-go zones,\" she said, arguing that if consent cannot be obtained safely, contact should not occur at all.",
      "The Associated Press reported last year on loggers who were killed by bow and arrow after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru's Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
      "There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.",
      "In 2018, American\u00a0John Allen Chau\u00a0was killed after kayaking to a remote Indian island populated by an isolated tribe known for shooting at outsiders with bows and arrows.",
      "How the threats have evolved",
      "Watson, who has worked across the Amazon for 35 years, said early threats stemmed from colonization and state-backed infrastructure. During Brazil's military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, highways were bulldozed through the rainforest \"without due regard\" for the people living there.",
      "\"The roads acted as a magnet for settlers,\" she said, describing how loggers and cattle ranchers followed, bringing gunmen and disease that wiped out entire communities.",
      "A group known as\u00a0FENAMAD, which defends the rights of Peru's Indigenous peoples, says\u00a0tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes\u00a0are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.",
      "A railway line now planned in Brazil could potentially affect three uncontacted peoples, she said, but the rise of organized crime poses an even greater risk.",
      "Across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, drug traffickers and illegal gold miners have moved deep into Indigenous territories. \"Any chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\" she said. \"And bows and arrows are no match for guns.\"",
      "Evangelical missionary incursions have also caused outbreaks. Watson recalled how, under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical pastor was placed in charge of the government's unit for uncontacted peoples and gained access to their coordinates. \"Their mission was to force contact - to 'save souls,'\" she said. \"That is incredibly dangerous.\"",
      "Ways to protect uncontacted peoples",
      "Protecting uncontacted peoples, experts say, will require both stronger laws and a shift in how the world views them - not as relics of the past, but as citizens of the planet whose survival affects everyone's future.",
      "Advocates have several recommendations.",
      "First, governments must formally recognize and enforce Indigenous territories, making them off-limits to extractive industries.",
      "Mapping is crucial, Bhattacharjee said, because identifying the approximate territories of uncontacted peoples allows governments to protect those areas from loggers or miners. But, she added, it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups' health or autonomy.",
      "Second, corporations and consumers must help stop the flow of money driving destruction. Survival's report calls for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from Indigenous lands.",
      "\"Public opinion and pressure are essential,\" Watson said. \"It's largely through citizens and the media that so much has already been achieved to recognize uncontacted peoples and their rights.\"",
      "Finally, advocates say the world must recognize why their protection matters. Beyond human rights, these communities play an outsized role in stabilizing the global climate.",
      "\"With the world under pressure from climate change, we will sink or swim together,\" Bhattacharjee said.",
      "Governments' uneven response",
      "International treaties such as the International Labor Organization's Convention 169 and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirm the right to self-determination and to remain uncontacted if they choose. But enforcement varies widely.",
      "In Peru, Congress recently rejected a proposal to create the Yavari-Mirim Indigenous Reserve, a move Indigenous federations said leaves isolated groups exposed to loggers and traffickers.",
      "In Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has sought to rebuild protections weakened under Bolsonaro, boosting budgets and patrols. In 2018,\u00a0footage showed an indigenous man\u00a0believed to be the last remaining member of an isolated tribe in the Brazilian Amazon.",
      "And in Ecuador, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled this year that the government failed to protect the Tagaeri and Taromenane peoples who live in voluntary isolation in Yasuni National Park.",

      "\"Achievements of the last 20 or 30 years are in danger of being dismantled,\" she said.",
      "In July 2024,\u00a0photos emerged of the uncontacted tribe\u00a0searching for food on a beach in the Peruvian Amazon. Survival International\u00a0said\u00a0at the time the photos and videos posted showed about 53 male Mashco Piro. The group estimated as many as 100 to 150 tribal members would have been in the area with women and children nearby.",
      "\"This is irrefutable evidence that many Mashco Piro live in this area, which the government has not only failed to protect but actually sold off to logging companies,\" Alfredo Vargas Pio, president of local Indigenous organization FENAMAD, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time.",
      "A 2023 report by the United Nations' special reporter on\u00a0the rights of Indigenous peoples\u00a0said Peru's government had recognized in 2016 that the Mashco Piro and other isolated tribes were using territories that had been opened to logging. The report expressed concern for the overlap, and that the territory of Indigenous peoples hadn't been marked out \"despite reasonable evidence of their presence since 1999.\"",
      "What the new report calls for",
      "Survival International's report urges a global no-contact policy: legal recognition of uncontacted territories, suspension of mining, oil and agribusiness projects in or near those lands and prosecution of crimes against Indigenous groups.",
      "Watson said logging remains the biggest single threat, but mining is close behind. She pointed to the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa on Indonesia's Halmahera Island, where nickel for electric-vehicle batteries is being mined.",
      "\"People think electric cars are a green alternative,\" she said, \"but mining companies are operating on the land of uncontacted peoples and posing enormous threats.\"",
      "In South America, illegal gold miners in the Yanomami territory of Brazil and Venezuela continue to use mercury to extract gold - contamination that has poisoned rivers and fish.",

      "In a statement, police said the narcotics were hidden in the hold of the boat, which was flying a Tanzanian flag and had departed from Panama en route to Vigo, in north-west Spain. The cargo ship, which was approximately 177 feet long, had unusual structures on board which concealed the narcotics, officials said.",

      "President Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip on which he's expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to try to de-escalate a\u00a0trade war.",
      "\"We have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday night as he left the White House. \"I think we'll have a good meeting.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said that US-China trade talks reconvened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at around 9:15 a.m. local time on Sunday morning.",
      "The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit.",
      "Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its\u00a0purchases of Russian oil with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow's two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week.",
      "When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, \"I think a complete deal.\"",

Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there's no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip.",
      "\"America is shut down and the President is skipping town,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Mr. Trump's first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia.",

      "\"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit.",

      "Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn't stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire.",
      "From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he's expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump's planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%.",
      "The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office.",
      "Mr. Trump said Takaichi's relationship with Abe was \"a good sign\" and \"I look forward to meeting her.\"",

    "summary": "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning from Paris' famous Louvre museum.",
    "story": [
      "Two people were arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from Paris' Louvre museum, a Paris prosecutor said on Sunday, a week after the brazen heist at the world's most visited museum.",
      "The prosecutor said investigators made the arrests Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Paris' Roissy Airport.",
      "French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests and did not say whether jewels had been recovered.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria. The official added that one of the suspects was identified through DNA traces. Beccuau said earlier this week that forensics experts were analyzing 150 samples at the scene.",
      "The suspects can be held in police custody up to 96 hours.",
      "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning.",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the museum and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels. The museum's director called the incident a \"terrible failure.\"",
      "Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She rued in her statement the premature leak of information, saying it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators \"mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators.\" Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.",
      "French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez praised \"the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.\"",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "One piece \u2014 Eug\u00e9nie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds \u2014 was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels\u00a0were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture stated in a press release to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 26, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He joins us from Seneca, South Carolina. Welcome back to Face The Nation. Senator--",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, Defense Secretary Hegseth ordered the deployment of the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Gerald Ford, to Latin America. President Trump was asked if he planned to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK. We're going to kill them. You know, they're going to be, like, dead.",
      "[SOUNDS OF TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't need an aircraft carrier to hit drug boats are land strikes planned?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think that's a real possibility. I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug, drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go, that Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long, and President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia. So there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land. I support that idea, but I think he has all the authority he needs. Senator Gallego, on another network, accused President Trump and our military of committing murder by attacking these drug boats. To our men and women in uniform, you're not murdering anybody. You're making America safer by going after a narco-terrorist. You're following lawful orders. When President Bush, 41, took Ortega out in Panama, Reagan went into Grenada to deal with the Cuban influence from Grenada in our backyard, he has all the authority in the world. This is not murder. This is protecting America from being poisoned by narco-terrorists coming from Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot there. But just to clarify the examples you're citing, also involved ground troops. You said time for Maduro to go. That sounds a lot like regime change. Are you talking about troops on the ground?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I'll let the President speak to that. I'm talking about a briefing that would expand military operations potentially from the sea to the land. It is time for Maduro to go. It was time for Ortega to go. You know, the Monroe Doctrine has been robustly applied by President Trump. So these military assets are moving forward to deal with a country that's got blood on its hands when it comes to Americans by flooding our country with drugs from Venezuela and Colombia. So I hope Maduro would leave peacefully, but I don't think he's going to stay around much longer. I think President Trump is tired of Venezuela being used as a staging platform to poison America?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Well, there's a lot there, sir, but you cited a Democratic senator's criticism. He's not the only one. Some of your Republican colleagues have been uncomfortable with what little information has been shared with Congress. Take a listen:",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: If they want all out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out that has to have a declaration of war. It's something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I'm not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but the Congress should vote. And the President shouldn't do this by himself.",
      "SEN. JAMES LANKFORD: If this was happening with this level of insight under the Biden administration, I'd be apoplectic.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Todd Young also criticized this, what exactly is the end game? Because you're talking about regime change in Venezuela, the President says this is about drug boats.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, I think the end game is to make sure that Venezuela and Colombia cannot be used to poison America, that the narco-terrorist dictator Maduro no longer be able to threaten our country and to send in drugs to kill Americans. As to Rand Paul, I just disagree fundamental with his approach. We didn't have a declaration to go into Panama. Bush 41 went into Panama to replace the leadership there, because the Panama leadership, Panamanian leadership, were working with drug cartels to threaten our country. Reagan didn't have a declaration of war congressional authorization to deal with Cuban influence. So this idea- Rand Paul, I just fundamentally disagree with. To the other senators, you deserve more information, and you're going to get more information, but there is no requirement for Congress to declare war before the commander-in-chief can use force. Panama and Grenada are two examples in our backyard, where Republican presidents chose to go after countries and leaders that were threatening our people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there seemed to be a number of issues wound up in here. I know you personally used to serve as a judge advocate in the Air Force. We looked at the JAG manual: preventative self defense employed to counter non imminent threats is illegal under international law. So if we are not at war and these suspected criminals pose no threat of imminent violence, isn't this potentially a war crime to be killing the people on these boats and then to be taking out a leader?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, not at all. I don't know what man you're referring to, but I know what President Bush, 41 did. He took down Ortega [sic], the leader of Panama, because he was involved in drug trafficking threatening our country. Venezuela is now partnering with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is running out of money because Iran is weak.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's not new.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Partnering with drug cartels in Venezuela. No, it should have stopped. Here's what, here's what's new. You got a commander-in-chief's not going to put up with this crap. We're not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country. We're going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America, and we're now going to expand operations, I think, to the land. So please be clear about what I'm saying today. President Donald Trump sees Venezuela and Colombia as direct threats to our country, because they house Narco terrorist organizations. The leader of Venezuela is an indicted drug dealer in American courts. So yeah, the game is changing when it comes to drug traffickers and drug cartels. We're going to use military force like we have in the past to protect our country. That's the new game we're playing, and I'm glad we're playing that game, and if I were Maduro, I'd find a way to leave before heat goes down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is trafficking cocaine an armed attack on the United States? That's what you're equating it to?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I am saying that there's plenty of law under article, Article Two powers of the President are designed to protect our countries from threats foreign and domestic. Was it illegal for Bush to take Ortega out in Panama? Was it illegal for Reagan to go into Grenada to stop Cuban influence building this big, long runway? There's plenty of precedent here to do what he's doing. But the game has changed. The game has changed when it comes to narco trafficking, drug organizations. We're going to take you out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you referenced something earlier. Sorry. I want to come back to you said to the men and women of the military that they are carrying out lawful orders. Secretary Hegseth removed the top uniformed lawyers in the Air Force, you know this, the Navy and the Army, because he called them roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander-in-chief. There have been other departures as well. This raises concern that commanders are not being given adequate legal counsel. That is why you just said that sentence, to assure them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's that's garbage, that's absolute garbage\u2013",
      "(Crosstalk)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which that Hegseth said that?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: No, no. I'm saying that- the theory that President Trump's doing something here illegally, dealing with a country that's run by an indicted drug dealer. It's the same as Panama. There's a better case to go into Venezuela than there was Panama. There's a better case to deal with Colombia than there was Grenada. Yeah, I've been doing this all of my adult life. I have all the confidence in the world that President Trump has the legal authority, but more importantly, he's doing the right thing. More Americans have died from cocaine and fentanyl poisoning than any terrorist group in the world. I am very pleased that we now have a president who's going to use the full force of, of the American people, the might of America, to protect us from narco terrorist states and drug organizations. Keep it up, Mr. President, we're not committing murder. We're protecting our nation from people who want to poison us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's obviously buyers on the other end of it, which is why the cartels are selling, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well yeah, we'll deal with both. We'll deal with both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well I want to come back to\u2013 when we talk about lawful orders here, I myself spoke to a former senior commander who said he'd want that in writing because of concern that, that this is going to be down the line questionable.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What in writing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've already heard the orders to carry out operations. You've already heard Democratic lawmakers, including on this program, say that they have concerns about future prosecutions of officers.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well act on your concerns. Why don't you- Why don't you- Okay, if you've got concerns, here's what we can do as members of Congress. We can cut off funding for military operations we don't like. So if you're concerned as a Democrat or Republican, why don't you introduce legislation to cut off all funding to the military when it comes to attacking drug votes and going after narco terrorist states through the military. You can do that. Go ahead and do it. I'll vote no. I think it has all the authority in the world under Article Two and international law to make sure that countries like Venezuela can't be staging areas to infiltrate drugs into our country. It's not a, I think it has all the legal authority in the world. I'm just really glad he's doing this and Mr. President, keep it up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look forward to hearing those justifications when they are shared with Congress. You made some news there, Senator. Thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 13:06:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement comes as part of nuclear messaging from the Kremlin, which has resisted Western pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Russia tested a new nuclear-capable and powered cruise missile fit to confound existing defenses, inching closer to deploying it to its military, President Vladimir Putin said in remarks released on Sunday.",
      "The announcement, which followed years of tests of the Burevestnik missile, comes as part of nuclear messaging from the Kremlin, which has resisted Western pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine and strongly warned the U.S. and other NATO allies against sanctioning strikes deep inside Russia with longer-range Western weapons.",
      "A video released by the Kremlin showed Putin, dressed in camouflage fatigues, receiving a report from Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia's chief of general staff, who told the Russian leader that the Burevestnik covered 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) in a key test Tuesday.",
      "Gerasimov said the Burevestnik, or storm petrel in Russian, spent 15 hours in the air, adding \"that's not the limit.\"",
      "Little is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been skeptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable.",
      "When\u00a0Putin first revealed\u00a0that Russia was working on the weapon in his 2018 state-of-the-nation address, he claimed it would have an unlimited range, allowing it to circle the globe undetected by missile defense systems.",
      "Many observers argue that such a missile could be difficult to handle and pose an environmental threat. The U.S. and the Soviet Union worked on nuclear-powered missiles during the Cold War, but they eventually shelved the projects, considering them too hazardous.",
      "The Burevestnik\u00a0reportedly suffered an explosion\u00a0in August 2019 during tests at a navy range on the White Sea, killing five nuclear engineers and two service members and resulting in a brief spike in radioactivity that fueled fears in a nearby city.",
      "Russian officials never identified the weapon involved, but the U.S. said it was the Burevestnik.",
      "\"We need to determine the possible uses and begin preparing the infrastructure for deploying these weapons to our armed forces,\" Putin told Gerasimov.",
      "The Russian leader also claimed it was invulnerable to current and future missile defenses, due to its almost unlimited range and unpredictable flight path.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, a top Putin aide who was in the U.S. as the video surfaced, said his delegation informed U.S. colleagues of the \"successful testing\" of the Burevestnik, which he said was an \"absolutely new class\" of weapon.",
      "Earlier this week, Putin directed drills of Russia's strategic nuclear forces that featured practice missile launches. The exercise came as his planned summit on Ukraine with U.S. President Trump was put on hold.",
      "The Kremlin said that the maneuvers involved all parts of Moscow's nuclear triad, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that were test-fired from launch facilities in northwestern Russia and a submarine in the Barents Sea. The drills also involved Tu-95 strategic bombers firing long-range cruise missiles.",
      "The exercise tested the skills of military command structures, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:48:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The boy ate between 80 and 100 magnets, which he said had been purchased from an online retailer.",
    "story": [
      "A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after eating dozens of high-powered magnets, according to a recently published case report in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The boy lost part of his bowel as a result, doctors wrote.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the case report, ate between 80 and 100 magnets. The \"high-power\" magnets were 5x2 millimeters each, the report said.",
      "After eating the magnets, the teen had general abdominal pain for four days. When he arrived at the hospital, he told doctors he had eaten the magnets about a week earlier. The hospital he was treated at was not identified in the report.",
      "The case report did not say if the boy explained why or how he ate the magnets.",
      "Eating multiple magnets can be incredibly dangerous because they can clamp together inside the body and cause organ damage or other complications. Patients who eat multiple magnets often need surgical intervention, according to the report. High-powered magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys for adults, are particularly risky. They can be five to 10 times stronger than traditional refrigerator magnets, CBS News reported in 2019.",
      "Scans showed that the magnets had linked into four chains inside the teen's bowel and at the start of his large intestine. The amount of magnets in his body disrupted some imaging, the report said, so doctors proceeded with an exploratory surgery.",
      "During the operation, surgeons found the magnet chains were causing pressure necrosis in the bowel and large intestine. Pressure necrosis occurs when tissue dies because there is too much pressure on it for an extended period of time. The surgeons were able to successfully remove the magnets, and the boy recovered from the operation. He was discharged after eight days in the hospital, the report said.",
      "The sale of these high-powered magnets has been permanently banned in New Zealand, but the prohibition is difficult to enforce because the magnets can be easily and cheaply purchased online, the report noted. The boy told doctors he purchased the magnets on the online site Temu.",
      "Temu told CBS News that they were \"sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery.\" A\u00a0Temu spokesperson told CBS News Saturday they had not been able to independently verify if the magnets were bought on the site.",
      "The company said after launching an internal review that\u00a0listings currently available to ship to New Zealand are compliant with the country's regulations.",
      "\"While these products are lawful to sell, they can be dangerous if swallowed and we support efforts to raise public awareness about magnet safety,\" the company said.",
      "\"We take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\" the spokesperson said Friday.",
      "Online retailers, including Amazon and AliExpress, list high-powered magnets as available to ship to New Zealand.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has worked to limit the sale of high-powered magnets in the United States. In 2014, the agency issued a ban on high-powered magnet sets, but it was overturned in court two years later. In September 2022, the agency established a mandatory safety standard for magnets. The rule sets a power limit for any product with loose or separable magnets, including those intended for purposes including entertainment and stress relief.",
      "The CPSC also\u00a0calls the magnets a safety risk and has issued numerous recalls for products that contain them.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Since September, the U.S. has been carrying out strikes on alleged drug cartel boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has been carrying out intermittent strikes on vessels alleged to be carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September.",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Democrats and some Republicans in Congress worry the strikes could lead to a larger conflict in the Caribbean. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he wonders why U.S. leaders \"would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are.\" He says he wants to force a vote with a bipartisan group of senators to block the president from military action in the region unless explicitly authorized by Congress.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats ineffective, since the strikes are largely targeting alleged lower-level smugglers.",
      "\"You have to capture the bosses,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "What else is the Trump administration doing to combat drug trafficking from Latin America?",
      "The Pentagon said on Oct. 24 that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's campaign to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "Stefan  Becket\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "During a Q&A at the New Yorker Festival on Saturday, the actress said Cruise was \"embarrassed\" about her pregnancy while the pair prepared for the 1992 legal drama, \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "\"I think Tom was quite embarrassed,\" Moore, who was pregnant at the time with her second child, Scout Willis, said, per People. \"I actually felt OK about it. I was moving around, though, right? But I could tell he felt that it was a bit awkward.\"",
      "The \"Substance\" star \u2014 who also shares daughters Rumer Willis and Tallulah Willis with ex-husband Bruce Willis \u2014 said she felt Cruise's discomfort may have stemmed from the ongoing pressure set upon women to choose a family or a career at the time.",

Why can\u2019t you have both?\u2019 But with that, I think, came a lot of pressure I put on myself to, in a sense, prove that it was possible.\"",

      "\"Now I have a much more kind of intuitive, relaxed relationship with my body,\" Moore continued. \"I trust when it tells me it needs something to eat, that it\u2019s thirsty. I listen to my body today, and I have a lot less fear. When I was younger, I felt like my body was betraying me. And so I just tried to control it. And now I don\u2019t operate from that place.

      "Royal author Andrew Lownie has written an explosive new book titled \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\"",
      "Following Prince Andrew\u2019s scandals, Prince William and Kate Middleton are said to be quietly enforcing a stricter, \"zero-tolerance\" approach within the monarchy.",
      "British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital the Prince and Princess of Wales, who represent the British royal family\u2019s future, are more determined than ever to safeguard that legacy while supporting King Charles III.",
      "\"Prince William, in particular, is not satisfied with how the Prince Andrew situation has been handled at the moment,\" Chard claimed. \"He is looking into the future with a solution-focused lens. He is far more ruthless than his father. He always takes the harder line. He can see reputational damage escalating for the royal family and is reviewing a decisive way forward to combat further scandals.\"",

      "\"He realizes it\u2019s harder for the king to deal with his brother than it will be for him to deal with his uncle in due course,\" said Chard.",
      "\"However, he feels his father has teetered too long with the kid gloves approach. Prince William and the whole royal family are fully supportive of King Charles taking a stronger stance against his brother. William would prefer a swift, clean break with Prince Andrew before things decline further. He also hopes to shield the king from the damage.\"",

      "On Oct. 17, Andrew announced he was relinquishing his Duke of York title and other honors after renewed scrutiny over his friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the monarch\u2019s younger brother said, \"The continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family.\"",

His latest announcement came days after the posthumous memoir by Virginia Roberts Giuffre was published on Oct. 21.

      "Participants who added backward walking to their routines several times a week for six weeks reported significant improvements in knee function and pain reduction compared to those who stuck with standard forward walking.",
      "Researchers found that walking backward changes how muscles around the knee work. Because the stride is shorter and the landing is softer, it reduces compressive forces on the joints, meaning less wear and tear over time.",

      "Another recent study, published in PLOS One, examined how backward walking affects people with chronic lower back pain.

      "Walking backward engages muscles that are often underused. (iStock)",

      "Walking backward can also aid spatial awareness and coordination. (iStock)",
      "The Cleveland Clinic notes that backward walking isn\u2019t only good for the joints, but also a workout for the mind. Moving in reverse challenges spatial awareness, coordination and concentration. That extra mental effort strengthens the connection between your brain and muscles, helping improve balance and reaction time.",
      "It\u2019s also more physically demanding than it looks.

      "Health start-up 'SpotitEarly' is using dogs to help sniff out the four most common types of cancer, helping people detect the disease early.",
      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

    "summary": "Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about the flaws in the current H-1B visa program that must be addressed to benefit the American college graduate.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.",
      "As the Trump administration makes moves to change the\u00a0H-1B visa program to benefit American-born workers, Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello backed those efforts in an interview with Fox News Digital while offering his expertise on other issues that need to be addressed with work visas.",
      "Vianello told Fox News Digital that one of the \"biggest challenges\" with the current H-1B system is the \"impact\" on college hiring, particularly with computer science and computer engineering graduates.",
      "Vianello explained that the unemployment rate for college graduates with those degrees is significantly higher than the average for all college graduates and there is a \"concerning\" level of unemployment with college graduates in IT.",
      "\"So that basically means they didn't need degrees for the jobs that they're currently in, being significantly under employed,\" Vianello said. \"How does the H-1B visa program impact that? Well, firstly, rough estimates are that there are about 730,000 H-1B holders in the U.S. and about 550,000 dependents. Most of them, in excess of 70% of them, are in IT.\"",
      "TRUMP\u2019S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST",
      "The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (Reuters/Jason Reed)",
      "Vianello went on to explain that data shows H-1B visa holders are paid \"significantly less\" than their counterparts doing equivalent IT roles, which gives them a leg up with employers who are looking to pay less.",
      "\"I think it gets a little more broadly than that,\" Vianello said. \"In addition to competing with H-1B visa holders, college graduates, especially in IT, are also competing with OPT visa holders. This is optional practical training, basically an extension of the F-1 visa, which is a student visa, which allows you, if you're a STEM graduate, to work in the U.S. for three years following your graduation.\"",
      "\"Now, the OPT visa holders don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes, so they're automatically 15% cheaper, and they are typically paid 42% less than their U S counterparts. So as a college grad, you're fighting this three-headed monster. You're graduating with student debt, you've got H-1B visa holders and OPT visa holders who have the ability to take your job and cost an employer significantly less, and then you're competing with the third one, which is the ability of an employer to simply offshore that work.\"",
      "Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa \u2013 as a company is required to sponsor the visa \u2013 and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.",
      "LABOR DAY CELEBRATION: HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS",
      "U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"The reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk posted on X last year as a\u00a0rift inside the MAGA movement was\u00a0raging on the issue.",
      "\"The intention was good around bringing in people with skills and retaining people in the US that are doing skills and are studying in the universities,\" Vianello said. \"But the outcome to college grads that are competing for those roles has been really bad.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration\u00a0unveiled a proposal designed to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.",
      "The $100,000 fee \u2014 a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions \u2014 will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.",
      "\"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it\u2019s just not [economical],\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Friday as Trump signed the order.",
      "Vianello told Fox News Digital, \"Certainly I think that the $100,000 fee on any new applications is gonna go a long way toward changing behavior, but that's focused on H-1B.\"",

      "President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Sept. 19, 2025. (Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)",
      "\"We've seen quite a bit of news recently around changes to the OPT visa program as well in terms of limiting the number of visas and limiting the countries that they come from. That's gonna have a significant impact on the pipeline of people coming through as well. And so I believe those measures are gonna start changing the behavior of many of the employers.\"",
      "The argument from H-1B supporters that the United States is bringing in the \"best and the brightest\" is a sentiment Vianello pushed back on.",
      "\"In the last 18 months, according to layoffs.fyi, these large companies have laid off 250,000 tech professionals, but at the same time, the cap for H-1B visas was secured before the end of 2024 for the entire 2025, which is 85,000 people,\" Vianello explained. \"So you're laying off 250,000 U.S. tech workers, but you're applying for the maximum cap that you can for H-1B visa holders. That doesn't make sense. If there's a shortage of skills, why are you laying off 250,000 people? So you can see the way it's structured. It's being used as a labor arbitrage to bring down these large companies' tech costs.\"",
      "Vianello, who came here on a visa, told Fox News Digital he is not opposed to worker visa programs in general, but stressed they shouldn't leave American workers behind.",
      "\"I fully support using visas to attract top-tier technologists to the U.S. I came here on a Specialty Occupation Visa myself, which required my employer to invest significantly to bring me over,\" Vianello said. \"What I oppose is the misuse of programs like H-1B and OPT as tools for labor arbitrage, which undercuts entry-level opportunities for U.S. tech graduates and distorts the talent market.\"",

      "In late September 2017, Palestinian American activist Linda Sarsour, once the darling of the Women\u2019s March and the self-declared face of the \"resistance\" against\u00a0Donald Trump, was\u00a0facing mounting criticism for antisemitic remarks and her embrace of extremist views.",
      "But, beaming in a photograph taken on a city sidewalk, Sarsour appeared unfazed, her iconic fist pumped in the air as she knelt shoulder-to-shoulder with campaign volunteers for City Council candidate Khader El-Yateem. The photo was posted by El-Yateem on the Facebook page he used to promote his campaign, which he lost, but among the smiling faces was a young organizer named\u00a0Zohran Mamdani.",
      "In late September 2017, Palestinian American pastor Khader El-Yateem shared a photo of his campaign team from his bid to be elected to New York's City Council from Brooklyn's District 43. Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour (far left, front row) took a knee with Zohran Mamdani (fourth from right, white shirt). El-Yattem lost the race. (@Khader El-Yateem/Facebook)",
      "That photo would mark the start of a carefully constructed political project that, in less than a decade, would propel a now-34-year-old socialist newcomer to the precipice of running America\u2019s largest city \u2013 even while campaigning with radical imams, some of whom have supported terrorists and terrorist financiers.",

      "A\u00a0database\u00a0of 110 groups backing Mamdani exposes a tight inner circle of organizations that identify as Muslim or socialist, working hand-in-glove with 76 Democratic Party affiliates, allied groups and unions. Particularly important in this\u00a0political machine\u00a0are two networks \u2013 Sarsour\u2019s MPower organizations and another constellation of groups called Emgage, with which she\u00a0works closely.",
      "The organizations have been generously funded. In total, billionaire George Soros\u2019 Open Society philanthropies have given MPower and Emgage nearly $2.5 million in recent years, according to tax filings.",

      "\"We fund a range of civil society organizations that\u00a0work to deepen civic engagement through peaceful democratic participation, counter discrimination including against Muslim Americans and advance human rights,\" a spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Fox News Digital. \"The grants that you cite all occurred years before the mayoral race, and we are a nonpartisan organization that does not fund political candidates and their campaigns.\"",
      "Mamdani, Sarsour and the groups supporting Mamdani's campaign didn't return requests for comment.",
      "MPower and Emgage have been part of a tight inner circle of 30 ethnic and religious groups, that also includes\u00a0CAIR Action, the 501(c)(4) political wing of the 501(c)(3) Council on American-Islamic Relations nonprofit,\u00a0the Islamic Circle of North America,\"\u00a0\"Muslim Action Coalition,\"\u00a0Yemeni American Merchants Associations Inc., the\u00a0\"Bangladeshi American Advocacy Group\" and\u00a0\"Desis Rising Up and Moving.\" They have pumped up Mamdani\u2019s campaign with\u00a0social media campaigns,\u00a0canvassing,\u00a0voters\u00a0and\u00a0buzz.",
      "Altogether, they have annual revenues of about $24 million, and they have worked to promote Mamdani\u2019s campaign with\u00a0endorsements,\u00a0fund-raising,\u00a0social media campaigns and\u00a0canvassing.",
      "The result: a carefully constructed political career that mainstreams the socialist goals\u00a0long embraced by Sarsour and fellow members of the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "It\u2019s a machine that is expressing itself in races from New York to Virginia, Minnesota, Texas and California with MPower and Emgage aligning with the Democratic Socialists of America and the Democratic Party to propel candidates who may share their views. In a campaign called\u00a0\"Defend and Advance,\"\u00a0Emgage SuperPac is pushing Mamdani and Democratic Virginia Lt. Governor candidate Ghazala Hashmi\u00a0as its \"star candidates.\"",

      "Emgage\u2019s donations include $175,000 from a group little-noticed by political observers but important in Islamist circles:\u00a0Sterling Charitable Gift Fund, based in Herndon, Va. It is part of a\u00a0network of groups that FBI agents raided in 2002 as part of wider investigations into the funding of Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas.

      "Over almost a decade, Sarsour and her allies have orchestrated a network of well-financed and tightly connected socialist activists, radical imams, political organizers and nonprofit organizations funded with millions of dollars by major philanthropies, including Foundation to Promote Open Society, the Ford Foundation, Macarthur Foundation and the Tides Foundation.",
      "The confluence of big philanthropy, partisan operatives and clerical authority has helped drive Mamdani\u2019s ascent. Its architecture combines nonprofit activism with faith-based politics and the precision of a professional campaign operation.",
      "\"To the casual observer, Zohran Mamdani\u2019s rise might appear meteoric \u2013 a story of grassroots energy and demographic change in America\u2019s largest city,\" said Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American Muslim who is running against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar\u00a0in Minnesota, with Omar supported by the same kind of political machine being unleashed to propel Mamdani to office.",
      "\"The data, the money trail and the affiliations, from the Democratic Socialists of America to the Islamists, tells a different story.\"",
      "\"Mamdani\u2019s ascent is the product of deliberate design: a sophisticated collaboration between socialist activism and Islamist organizing, lubricated by millions in foundation grants and political donations and normalized through a revolving door of political operatives and nonprofits who embrace Islamists, the destruction of the state of Israel and hostilities to the police, the U.S. and the West,\" Al-Aqidi said.",
      "The timeline of Mamdani\u2019s rise tracks precisely with the growth of this network. In 2012, as a student at Bowdoin College, in Maine, he\u00a0cofounded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, the campus organization known for its rabid anti-Israel activism. By 2017, he was canvassing for El-Yateem\u2019s campaign with Sarsour\u2019s mentorship.",
      "Activist Linda Sarsour, shown here at a demonstration in Manhattan's Foley Square, was an early backer of Mamdani's political aspirations. (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "In 2018, Mamdani formally entered Sarsour\u2019s orbit through the\u00a0Muslim Democratic Club of New York, an organization she co-founded in 2013 to mobilize Muslim voters and elect progressive Democrats to local office. The Muslim Democratic Club of New York served as both incubator and amplifier for Sarsour\u2019s political brand, one that fused progressive politics with an explicitly Islamist social identity. By December 2018, Mamdani joined the board, in an\u00a0announcement in which the group said, \"Help build Muslim power across the city with us!\"",
      "UNEARTHED VIDEO EXPOSES MAMDANI'S 'UNABASHED' COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING ANTI-ISRAEL SANCTIONS AS LAWMAKER",
      "Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani supporters gather outside 30 Rock in New York City on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.\u00a0 (Fox News Digital/Deirdre Heavey)",
      "With his new role, Mamdani gained access to an emerging infrastructure of influence: voter lists, donor networks and organizing muscle that would later power his campaign to a seat on the New York General Assembly. The Muslim Democratic Club endorsed Mamdani.",
      "Around that time, Sarsour was building her own empire, founding MPower Change as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit housed at Neo Philanthropy Inc. Public filings show MPower Change took in at least $2.4 million between 2017 and 2024, the latest year available, with Soros\u2019s Foundation to Promote Open Society giving her organization $1.125 million and the Macarthur Foundation funneling her $450,000. It would become a flagship digital organizing hub for not just Sarsour but Mamdani.",
      "Meanwhile, Emgage Action was expanding its footprint nationally. Also backed by the Open Society network, Emgage Action received a share of $42.5 million that Soros' foundations pledged to Muslim, Arab and South Asian civic groups beginning in 2021. It has received $1.8 million from the Open Society Policy Center and another $1.35 million from the Foundation to Promote Open Society.",
      "Together, MPower Change and Emgage created an unprecedented financial and political ecosystem, leveraging big philanthropy\u2019s dollars and digital strategy to elevate candidates like Mamdani under the banner of Muslim empowerment.",
      "In 2020, Mamdani won his first election to the New York State Assembly, with Sarsour\u2019s explicit endorsement and fundraising help.",
      "By 2020, Mamdani was being featured in Sarsour\u2019s #MyMuslimVote summit, promoted by MPower Change as the face of a new generation of unapologetic Muslim progressives. By this year, his campaign for mayor became the culmination of that project \u2014 backed by PAC money, boosted by clerical endorsements and legitimized by an activist ecosystem that had spent a decade grooming him for this very moment.",
      "REP. ELISE STEFANIK LABELS NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI A 'JIHADIST'",
      "New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, spoke to supporters at a canvass launch event in Prospect Park on Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025.\u00a0 (Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital)",
      "To push Mamdani toward the helm of the nation\u2019s biggest city, the network extended far beyond activist circles. Central to Mamdani\u2019s political ascent was a series of carefully cultivated relationships with clerics with some troubling views.",
      "In January, Mamdani courted Imam Muhammad Al-Barr of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, visiting his mosque just months after Al-Barr had\u00a0publicly prayed to \"annihilate\" Israel.",
      "In May, Imam Siraj Wahhaj, the longtime imam of Brooklyn\u2019s Masjid At-Taqwa, personally donated $1,000 to the Unity and Justice Fund. More recently, Mamdani met with Wahhaj and called him \"one of the nation\u2019s foremost Muslim leaders and a pillar of the Bed-Stuy community.\"",
      "Wahhaj, who served as a character witness in the trial of\u00a0Omar Abdel-Rahman, the \"Blind Sheikh\" later convicted of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has a long history of calling for the exploitation of America\u2019s democracy to further a conquest for Islam.",
      "\"You don't get in politics because it's the American thing to do,\" he said in a\u00a0videotaped 1991 sermon. \"You get involved in politics because politics can be a weapon to use in the cause of Islam.\"",
      "Wahhaj has\u00a0also\u00a0denounced\u00a0the U.S. government as \"controlled by Shaitan,\" the Arabic word for the devil, urged Muslims not to befriend \"non-believers,\" condemned homosexuality as \"a disease of this society,\" and supported Islamic laws that punish sex outside of marriage with 100 lashes and stoning.\u00a0In 2011, Wahhaj\u00a0urged\u00a0Muslims to donate to the\u00a0legal defense of the since-convicted Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist dubbed \"Lady Al Qaeda\" for attempting to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.",
      "Over the years, Wahhaj\u2019s sermons have praised\u00a0\"jihad\" without \"a gun,\"\u00a0called for an Islamic America governed by sharia law and\u00a0urged the creation of an \"army of 10,000 men in New York City.\"",
      "Other imams now backing Mamdani\u2019s mayoral run have also been controversial. Imam Talib Abdur-Rashid, a cleric leading the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, co-founded the Muslim Alliance in North America, alongside Wahhaj. In 2005, Abdur-Rashid\u00a0publicly defended Rafiq Sabir, an American doctor who joined al Qaeda and was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison.",

      "In 2008, Abdur-Rashid defended Sami Al-Arian, a Palestinian American professor whom the U.S. later\u00a0deported\u00a0to Turkey for\u00a0\"conspiring to provide services\" to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Still in the U.S., Al-Arian\u2019s wife\u00a0joined\u00a0the anti-Israel encampments at Columbia University.",
      "In September, Mamdani\u00a0appeared as the special guest speaker at Abdur-Rashid\u2019s annual gala. A month earlier, Muslim Association of North America\u2019s social media featured Abdur-Rashid visiting Wahhaj\u2019s mosque, underscoring the continued collaboration between the two imams.",
      "In Manhattan, Imam Khalid Latif, the executive director of the Islamic Center at New York University, has been another prominent Mamdani backer. Latif publicly endorsed Mamdani on Facebook in June, calling him \"a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare.\"",
      "In 2012, Latif\u00a0led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen and he hasn\u2019t faced the same type of allegations that surround the other imams.",
      "Zohran Mamdani meets Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Yusef Abdus Salaam on Oct. 17, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani/X)",
      "For many Muslim political organizations backing Mamdani, these clerics are not liabilities but assets, serving as trusted gatekeepers to the city\u2019s growing community of Muslim voters.",
      "After Mamdani visited Wahhaj\u2019s mosque earlier this month, he\u00a0tweeted out a photo of the two with the caption: \"Pleasure to meet Imam Siraj Wahhaj, one of the nation\u2019s foremost Muslim leaders.\" When a firestorm ensued,\u00a0several allies rose to his defense: Sarsour, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the leaders at Emgage Action.",
      "Sarsour\u00a0shared a selfie with Mamdani, beaming, like they did back in 2017, and wrote, \"May Allah continue to bless and protect you.\"",
      "A defiant Wa'el Alzayat, the executive director of Emgage Action, sent out a dispatch to followers on Tuesday, amid criticism for their political work, promising, \"We are in this for the long haul.\"",
      "Back in Minnesota, Al-Aqidi closely watched the defense of Mamdani.",
      "\"For over a decade, Linda Sarsour and her network of allies have built the Mamdani machine piece by piece: the institutions, the donors, the narratives and now, the candidate. There was no way they were going to throw him under the bus for one photo with one imam whom they happen to love,\" said Al-Aqidi. \"Mamdani is the fresh face of a radical coalition, and I hope New Yorkers will reject him. Win or lose, one fact remains undeniable. His rise was not spontaneous. It was engineered and the machinery behind it is only getting stronger.\"",

      "There appears to be no end in sight to the current government shutdown, with Democrats and Republicans still far from striking a federal spending deal nearly a month into fiscal year (FY) 2026.",

      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",
      "Hackers lure staff with convincing emails that mimic campus alerts or HR updates and steal login details in real time.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "6 ways to stay safe from payroll and phishing scams",
      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Scammers often send emails that look like they come from your HR department or university leadership, warning about payroll, benefits or urgent issues. Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Add an extra layer of security by enabling\u00a02FA on all accounts that support it. This means even if someone steals your password, they still can't log in without a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone.",
      "Even if you follow all precautions, it's smart to monitor your accounts for any unusual activity. Catching unauthorized transactions quickly can prevent bigger losses and alert you to potential scams before they escalate.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing. The scale and sophistication of these attacks highlight how vulnerable even well-established institutions can be to financially motivated threat actors.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "More than 1 million patients have been affected by a data breach involving SimonMed Imaging, one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and medical imaging providers. The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks. While WEEX operates as a legitimate platform, scammers often exploit the name of real exchanges to sound credible. They'll encourage victims to \"trade gold\" through what seems like an official account but actually directs them to fake sites or wallets designed to steal money.",
      "Why this could be a scam",
      "John's experience shows several red flags. The conversation began with a friendly invitation, then quickly shifted to a financial pitch. That's a classic move in online relationship scams. The younger person builds an emotional connection, then uses that trust to promote an \"opportunity.\" Scammers often promise guaranteed profits or claim they'll \"help you trade\" to make the process sound easy.",

      "Real investments always involve risk. Watch out for anyone who pressures you to act quickly or says the deal is \"private.\" Those urgency tactics are designed to keep you from thinking clearly.",

By blending romance with financial advice, these criminals make their victims believe they're building both trust and wealth. Protect yourself by treating every unexpected text with caution. If the conversation moves toward money, crypto, or gold trading, that's your cue to stop responding.

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",

      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store.

Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed.

      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",

      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute. But one thing is certain: Ohio has thrown a spotlight on one of the biggest questions of our time.",

A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture.

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",

      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",

Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense said China has been conducting training missions in the western Pacific aimed at limiting U.S. and allied military access. The exercises reflect Beijing's effort to expand its anti-access/area-denial, or A2/AD, capabilities \u2013 a strategy meant to keep opposing forces from entering or operating freely in nearby regions.",
      "The military spokesman for Taiwan \u2013 officially known as the Republic of China (ROC) \u2013 Lt. Gen. Sun Li-fang, told Fox News Digital in exclusive comments that the armed forces of the independently governed island fully understand the threats posed by China\u2019s expanding military might.",

      "Taiwan\u2019s military is on alert for the possibility that Communist China could turn \"training\" or an exercise into an actual war. Some analysts warn that a Chinese blockade would be difficult to break, but Sun said Taiwan has \"holistic plans to breach [any] blockade.\" He added that Taipei would \"urge its allies and like-minded partners\u00a0to treat any blockade as an act of war that should trigger a coordinated international response,\" noting that shipping disruptions in the seas near Taiwan would have serious effects on the global economy.",
      "Sun said Taiwan expects the PLA to continue its campaign of \"hybrid warfare\" or \"gray-zone operations,\" a mix of nonmilitary and paramilitary actions designed to pressure and harass Taiwan without formally declaring war. He warned that the PLA seeks to \"exhaust [Taiwan\u2019s] defense capability and blur the battlespace.\"",

The tactic, analysts say, is deliberate \u2013 part of a broader effort to wear down Taiwan\u2019s air force, degrade equipment and exhaust Taiwan\u2019s personnel.",

      "Beijing has never ruled Taiwan for even a single day, and Taiwan\u2019s military insists it will not allow China to dictate the rules of any future conflict. Instead, the island democracy is prioritizing the development of asymmetric warfare, a strategy in which, as Sun put it, \"the weaker party strikes at the weak point of the stronger party with appropriate tactics and weapons in order to gain advantages on the battlefield and change the outcome of the war.\"",
      "The spokesperson for the Taiwanese military, Lt. Gen. Sun Li-fang, addresses the media. (Taiwanese Armed Forces)",
      "The general said Taiwan\u2019s top priorities are to build asymmetric capabilities, strengthen operational resilience, expand reserve force capacity and improve defenses against gray-zone harassment. To achieve these goals, he said, Taiwan is expanding production and deployment of unmanned and AI-driven systems while dispersing command-and-control networks to make a knockout punch much more difficult. He also noted that Taiwan\u2019s surveillance and reconnaissance units are \"vigilant\" and that they \"exchange intelligence and perspectives on PLA activities with our allies and partners.\"",

      "Sun also rejected the idea that Taiwan lacks the will to defend itself and believes people here would strongly resist any attempt by the PRC to take Taiwan by force. Taiwan\u2019s military wants the world to know it is committed to its own defense, Sun said, pointing to the proposed 2026 defense budget, which will exceed 3% of GDP. Furthermore, he said, the government is actively pursuing reforms to make training \"as realistic as possible,\" is expanding reserve forces, and has already extended mandatory military service to one year.",

      "The State Department has told Fox News Digital it is working to reduce the \"national security\" threat to the U.S. from China\u2019s domination of the rare earth minerals market, with new signs that Africa can assist Washington in breaking Beijing\u2019s stranglehold on this vital sector.",
      "The 17 rare earth elements (REE) are metals \"critical for both human and national security,\" the Brookings Institution wrote in 2022, adding, \"They are used in electronics (computers, televisions and smartphones), in renewable energy technology (wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries), and in national defense (jet engines, missile guidance and defense systems, satellites, GPS equipment and more).\"",

      "But although Beijing has secured contracts in African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to ship minerals, including cobalt, east to China, the continent has vast untapped resources. And the African Union\u2019s Minerals Development Center stated recently that new huge specialist rare earth mines are due to come online by 2029 in Tanzania, Angola, Malawi and South Africa, and potentially yield almost 10% of the world\u2019s supply.",
      "This is leading the Trump administration to step forward with new attempts to expand the U.S. presence in Africa\u2019s mining trade. Just this week, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"The administration\u2019s approach prioritizes partnerships with African nations to ensure their minerals flow west, not east to China.\"",
      "In Africa, China is on Washington\u2019s threat radar, with the spokesperson continuing, \"China\u2019s dominance in global mineral supply chains \u2014 specifically in processing and refining \u2014 is a threat to both U.S. and African interests. Beijing\u2019s state-directed strategies exploit Africa\u2019s natural resources, consolidate control over upstream mining assets, perpetuate opaque governance structures, degrade local environments and create economic dependencies that undermine regional stability.\"",

      "The State Department spokesperson went on to say that one of the main benefits of the peace deal to end a 30-year war signed between the DRC and Rwanda in the Oval Office in June is better access to minerals, adding,\u00a0\"The bilateral agreement between the U.S. and DRC is designed to open the door for new U.S. and U.S.-aligned investments in strategic mining projects across the DRC.\"",

The Chinese model generally acquires projects once they are under development and/or nearing production. This offers a real opportunity for the United States and its allies. Even countries with long mining legacies \u2014 Zambia and the DRC \u2014 have barely scratched the surface, with less than half their land mapped.

    "summary": "Military and Middle East experts say a new Gaza rebuilding plan focused on creating secure enclaves, restoring stability and cutting off Hamas terrorists could succeed in the long term.",
    "story": [
      "While speaking to reporters in Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was open to working with the United Nations, but not its agency for Palestinians known as UNRWA.",
      "As the fragile ceasefire in Gaza holds, a new idea to divide the Strip into two areas is gaining traction. On one side would be life under Hamas\u2019s grip. On the other, a vision of what life would be like without the terror group.",
      "With Arab states signaling they will not fund reconstruction as long as the terror group remains in power, U.S. and Israeli officials are weighing a new approach of rebuilding in parts of Gaza still under Israeli control behind what Israeli officials call the \"yellow line.\"",
      "The hope, experts explain, is to create a living example of peace and recovery that could inspire change inside the areas still ruled by Hamas.",
      "The areas currently under Israeli control behind the so-called \"yellow line\" make up roughly 58% of the Gaza Strip, including all of Rafah in the south, large parts of Khan Younis and northern neighborhoods such as Beit Lahia and Shujaiyya. Hamas controls the remaining territory, including densely populated Gaza City. Despite the IDF presence, Hamas operatives remain active near the front lines.",
      "VANCE WARNS HAMAS AS GAZA PEACE PLAN'S CIVILIAN MILITARY COOPERATION CENTER OPENS",
      "The IDF announced that, as part of the ceasefire agreement and in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground. (IDF)",
      "John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, described the plan to divide Gaza into two distinct zones \u2014 one under Israeli control and the other under Hamas \u2014 allowing rebuilding only on the Israeli side both a \"practical and psychological test, a way to show Gazans what life could look like without Hamas.\"",
      "Spencer used the term \"Disneyland strategy\" to describe the concept, which he said was drawn from U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Iraq.",
      "\"You take any piece of the problem \u2014 here we\u2019re talking about terrain \u2014 and you clear out all the bad: Hamas, tunnels, weapons, everything,\" he said. \"Then you let civilians in, and you build something new \u2014 markets, buildings, schools, electricity. We called it Disneyland because we wanted it to look like hope \u2014 like the future.\"",
      "He said the idea follows the \"clear, hold, build\" model used in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops secured neighborhoods one by one.",
      "\"In Ramadi, we did it neighborhood by neighborhood until we covered the whole city,\" he said. \"You hold it, clear it, let the locals take over. It\u2019s historically proven. You don\u2019t have to rid Gaza of Hamas to start this.\"",
      "The goal, Spencer said, is to give Gazans \u2014 and the world \u2014 a tangible glimpse of life without Hamas.",

      "Still, he cautioned the concept is no silver bullet.",
      "\"You will have areas on the other side of the line where Hamas thinks they have control,\" he said. \"Building something without Hamas is as important to defeating Hamas as it is to showing people there\u2019s a future.\"",

      "\"Since the start of the ceasefire, we are terrified,\" one resident told Fox News Digital, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"We don\u2019t want to stay under Hamas. It\u2019s very terrifying for us to hear that Jared Kushner said reconstruction will only take place in the areas Hamas does not control. Trump and Netanyahu said Hamas will end, but look what\u2019s happening. They are back, stronger, and we are still trapped.",

      "Hussam al-Astal, who leads an anti-Hamas militia in Khan Younis, told Fox News Digital, \"We do not seek to rule Gaza, nor do we seek power.

      "Multiple sources say Israel has already offered limited support to al-Astal and other anti-Hamas factions on the ground.",
      "\"We saw a preview when the Majayda clan, in consort with anti-Hamas fighter Hussam al-Astal and aided by the IDF from the air, repelled Hamas in a localized battle,\" Joseph Braude, president of the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s a small example of what\u2019s likely to happen more broadly \u2014 local forces, backed by Israel, pushing out Hamas from the ground up.\"",

      "\"We are approaching a new reality in which it\u2019s feasible for reconstruction to begin in a portion of the Strip \u2014 the areas behind the yellow line \u2014 while fighting continues in the rest of Gaza,\" Braude said. \"Hamas is not a party to the peace process but a belligerent actor. Reconstruction is not contingent on Hamas\u2019 cooperation. It begins where Hamas can no longer operate, while the effort to eliminate its presence continues in other parts of the Strip.\"",
      "Braude said the plan envisions \"nascent enclaves of self-rule that gradually evolve into a coalition \u2014 the foundation for what could be called a Gazan Interim Transitional Authority.\"",
      "He concluded, \"Developing local fighting forces to counter Hamas is a capacity Gazans welcome and Israel and its allies have,\" he said. \"Building a functioning government with continuity, a rules-based system, and institutions \u2014 that\u2019s the harder work.\"",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",

Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",

      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",
      "Others see Putin's announcement as a response to sanctions this month by the European Union and Trump.",

    "summary": "Craig Melvin, Shenielle Jones and Dylan Dreyer talk about how they feel about the show's cooking segments during the TODAY Fan Fest event Taste of TODAY.",
    "story": [
      "Craig Melvin wears his heart on his sleeve \u2014 and his taste buds on his face.",
      "Asked if he can name the best thing he\u2019s ever eaten during a TODAY Food segment, Craig visibly flips through his Rolodex of memories, finally shaking his head.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because every month or two, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d he says, his eyes lighting up.",
      "He\u2019s getting ready to guide an audience through a cooking demo at the TODAY Fan Fest event Taste of TODAY, hosted at Platform by the James Beard Foundation.",
      "Also in attendance, a slew of super-fans watch TODAY Food segments happen in real life, mingle with the anchors and world-class chefs, and enjoy bites from the demos.",
      "\u201cWe had some Korean fried chicken this morning; she\u2019s here tonight,\u201d Craig says of chef Judy Joo and her recipe. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the most amazing Korean fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Craig adds that earlier in the week, chef Brian Lewis prepared his Herbed Pork Roast during the 3rd Hour, and he thought the same thing: \u201cOh, my God, this is the best pork I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he remembers.",
      "Sheinelle Jones has a similar reaction to another one of Lewis\u2019 dishes that day: the Roasted Beet and Burrata Salad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a beet salad, but it\u2019s not just any beet salad,\u201d she says, waving her hands in the air, emphatically. \u201cIt had fennel and pistachio. It was, like, amazing.\u201d",
      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook. While sampling those foods, attendees are also being served wine, beer and cocktails like Savannah\u2019s Savanita, provided by Diageo, Rockaway Brewing Company and Brooklyn Winery.",
      "On the menu tonight: Ayesha Nurdjaja\u2019s Chicken Shawarma with White Sauce, David Rose\u2019s Ancho Grilled Skirt Steak with Chipotle Chimichurri and Katie Lee Biegel\u2019s Chopped Dill Pickle Salad, all  prepared live for the audience by each chef.",
      "Craig says his favorite thing about food segments is the expertise on display.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the quality of food,\u201d he says, especially from culinary stars like Siri Daly, Edy Massih and Priyanka Naik, who are all in attendance.\u2029\u201cThe untold part of the TODAY Food story is the TODAY Food team, and they just do a remarkable job.\u201d",
      "He enjoys most things he eats on the show, but every now and again, he tries a dish that\u2019s not his thing \u2014 and his face makes that clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t hide it,\u201d Craig admits.",
      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",
      "\u201cMy kids don\u2019t like their food to touch, so they\u2019re still in the like, \u2018We like chicken, we like potatoes,\u2019 so sometimes I\u2019ll bring something home, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m called out on a lot on how much food I\u2019m eating,\u201d Dylan says during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by the best-of-the best chefs, you want to taste their food.",
      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

      "Clara is the daughter of Morgan and Chris Grant (Scott Eastwood), who had her when they were still in high school. Morgan's sister, Jenny, is newly engaged to her former high-school sweetheart Jonah (Dave Franco) after they reconnected, had a one-night-stand and welcomed a baby boy named Elijah.",
      "But the family's close dynamic is shattered when Chris and Jenny are killed in a car accident together, leaving Morgan and Jonah to reckon with why they were together in the first place. Meanwhile Clara, heartbroken by the death of her father and aunt, embarks on a relationship with Miller (Mason Thames), a boy from her school.",

      "The movie hit theaters Oct. 24. After the credits roll, here's your guide to any lingering questions.",
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the end of \"Regretting You.\"",
      "What Was Going on Between Chris and Jenny?",
      "Chris, Clara's father and husband to Morgan, and Jenny, Morgan's sister who was engaged to Jonah, were having an affair at the time of their death.",
      "It is revealed Chris was driving Jenny's car before the accident, even though their respective partners thought they were both at work.",

      "Who Is Elijah's Father?",
      "The revelation of the affair calls into question the paternity of Jenny's 1-year-old son, Elijah.",
      "After the accident, Jonah shows up to Morgan's house and starts to bang on the front door. He announces that Elijah \"has his smile,\" referring to Chris.",
      "Although never explicitly confirmed, it is implied for the rest of the film that Elijah is actually Chris' biological child.",
      "After the initial shock of discovering that Elijah is not his child, Jonah leaves Elijah in the care of Morgan. Jonah does not see Elijah for a few days, until Clara \u2014 whom Morgan has intentionally kept in the dark about her father and aunt's affair \u2014\u00a0shows up to his house and tells him to go and get his child back.",
      "Jonah realizes that even if he is not Elijah's biological father, he loves him and wants to raise him as his son. Jonah runs to Morgan's house and apologizes for leaving Elijah and promises to never leave again.",
      "As Morgan supports Jonah with Elijah, their close friendship from high school resumes and gradually turns romantic. Eventually, it's revealed that when they were teenagers, Jonah had asked Morgan if \"they had it wrong,\" implying he thought he and Morgan were supposed to be together, instead of Morgan and Chris, and Jenny and Jonah.",
      "Does Clara Find out About the Affair?",
      "One of the first scenes of the movie establishes the close relationship between Clara and her aunt Jenny. While running late for family dinner, Clara calls Jenny to tell her a story about Miller, a boy from school who later becomes her boyfriend. She ends the call by saying, \"Don't tell my mom.\"",
      "Their mother-daughter relationship is also strained by Clara\u2019s dreams of studying acting, which Morgan doesn\u2019t believe is a responsible choice.",
      "So when Morgan uncovers the affair, she tells Jonah that Clara can never find out about it, as she does not want to ruin Clara's memories of her dad and aunt.",
      "When Clara arrives home one evening and walks in on Morgan and Jonah sharing their first kiss, she storms into her room upset. Unaware of their shared history, Clara assumes that her mom and her aunt's fianc\u00e9 had moved on.",
      "Clara avoids her mother for a few days, until one morning when Morgan helps her overcome a hangover. As they are sitting at the kitchen table, Morgan finally reveals to Clara that Chris and Jenny had been having an affair.",
      "How Does 'Regretting You' End?",
      "After learning the truth, Clara is able to more healthily pursue her relationship with Miller, and Morgan finally begins a long-awaited relationship with Jonah.",
      "The final scene of the film sees Clara returning home from acting rehearsal to find her family, friends and now boyfriend Miller in front of a projector screen.",
      "Jonah and Morgan sit on a coach together, with baby Elijah laying next to them. The two share a kiss and watch as Miller begins a speech.",
      "Miller announces he has been accepted off the waitlist to a film school, the same school Clara plans to attend for their acting program the next year.",
      "Miller and Clara are overjoyed to be attending the same college, and he plays a short film that he made for Clara. In the film, Miller shows videos of him and Clara from the past year, and he asks Clara to be his date to prom.",
      "After the film, Morgan pulls Clara aside to say she supports her dream to study acting in college, despite her initial doubts. Morgan tells Clara she has an incredible talent, and that she will be able to succeed. The mother and daughter finally embrace."

I was still the hardworking, determined, courageous girl that I was with hair or without.\u201d",

      "Sickler went public with her condition on Instagram in September, noting she didn't want to keep hiding and found courage after winning the Miss Nevada competition.",
      "She believes it happened for a reason \u2014 a chance to share her story, offer hope and help others.",

      "The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami warned people in Jamaica to go to shelters and stay there during the storm, with dangerous conditions beginning Monday and lasting through Tuesday.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Melissa is set to make landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, before moving across southeastern Cuba Tuesday night as a Category 3 storm and across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday as a Category 2. Government officials in Jamaica are set to address the public at 11:30 a.m. Monday, as tropical storm conditions are already plaguing the island.",
      "At 8 a.m. ET, the storm was located about 135 miles southwest of Kingston, the capital of Jamaica. It had maximum sustained winds of 160 miles per hour and was moving west at 3 miles per hour, putting it in the highest and most dangerous category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale \u2014 and forecast to intensify even further, per the NHC.",
      "The most powerful storm to hit the region since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, Melissa will bring between 15 and 30 inches \u2014 and up to 40 inches \u2014 of rain to Jamaica, as well as extreme winds, extensive infrastructure damage and life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "It's the third Category 5 of the 2025 season. The last time there were more than two storms of this strength in the same season was 20 years ago, in 2005. Melissa is also the latest Category 5 storm in an Atlantic hurricane season in 27 years, since Hurricane Mitch in 1998.",
      "Some areas of eastern Jamaica could be inundated with up to 40 inches of rain, more than some areas of the country typically get in a year.",
      "Wind speeds in mountainous areas could be 30% higher that the main storm, meaning potential winds of more than 200 mph.",
      "Desmond Mackenzie, Jamaica\u2019s minister of local government and community development, said Sunday night that 218 people were already in some of the country's 881 shelters. As of Monday morning, all of the island's shelters were open, but many were still not full.",
      "Mackenzie said that many Jamaican communities \"will not survive this flooding.\"",
      "Jamaican residents were filling up gas canisters for their generators and boarding up windows to prepare for the intense wind and rain. Zookeepers in the capital city were relocating their animals ahead of the storm.",
      "An American tourist who caught one of the last flights from the island said there was a lot of turbulence getting back to the United States.",
      "\"It was almost like getting out and watching the rain come behind us,\" he said. \"But luckily we made it.\"",
      "Others weren't so lucky. Nicole Doyon, from Miami, was visiting the island for a yoga retreat, but couldn't get out before the storm despite exhausting all of her options.",
      "\"There was nothing available. At this point, there are no options,\" Doyon said.",
      "Haiti and the Dominican Republic will also face catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding by midweek, the hurricane center said, while Cuba is facing heavy rain, floods and landslides from Monday. There is also a hurricane watch for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "So far, the storm has killed at least four people, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "\"Although interaction with Jamaica will lead to some weakening, Melissa is expected to reach southeastern Cuba as a major hurricane, and will also move across the southeastern Bahamas and be near Bermuda as a hurricane,\" the hurricane center said in an analysis of the latest forecast."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",

      "PARIS \u2014 The hunt was on Monday for the thieves still on the run after the first suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested by French police.",
      "Two suspects with a history of jewel thefts had been tracked for days after their DNA was recovered from the museum and were arrested Saturday shortly before one of them was set to board a flight out of the country, a police official told NBC News.",
      "The breakthrough came a week after the robbers broke into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatening guards and drilling into display cases before escaping on scooters with eight of France\u2019s crown jewels worth an estimated $102 million.",
      "A major police operation has been underway to track down the thieves, who were captured on camera fleeing the scene. But there was still no sign of the jewels themselves.",
      "Police said DNA samples discovered at the crime scene helped identify the suspects.",
      "\"They left gloves, a walkie-talkie, a vest, and a can of gasoline,\" Axel Ronde, spokesman for the French police union CFTC, said in an interview Monday.",
      "\"And that allowed my colleagues from the forensic team to find these DNA traces,\" he said.",
      "Ronde added that the two arrested suspects were both men in their 30s, who had prior convictions and were known to police having previously targeted jewelry stores.",
      "They were both from Aubervilliers, a suburb in northeast Paris, Ronde said. He said that police decided to move in on Saturday when it became clear that one suspect was planning to flee to Algeria. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport 40 minutes before the flight was due to take off.",
      "While police can hold suspects for up to 48 hours without charge, in organized crime investigations like this one, the suspects\u2019 detention can be extended to 96 hours.",
      "\"I think there is going to be more arrests quickly,\" said Robert Wittman, a former FBI art crime investigator.",
      "He added that the arrest of the first suspects would allow police to gather more evidence through searches of their homes and cell phone data.",
      "While investigators worry that the thieves may melt down or dismantle the jewels to sell them off as soon as possible, there remains hope that the stolen artefacts can be recovered intact.",
      "According to Wittman, the thieves may have good reason to keep the jewels preserved rather than destroy them right away.",
      "\"In places like France, and Europe, they can use those to get out of jail free,\" he said, adding that destroying the jewels would leave the thieves with no \"bargaining tools\" if arrested.",
      "Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said investigators were continuing their search for the stolen jewels and the remaining suspects, but that it was \"too early\" to provide the public with any more detail.",
      "\"I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody,\u201d she said, adding that she did not want to hinder the investigation.",

      "A boy who swallowed up to 100 high-powered magnets purchased online has undergone major surgery to remove them.",
      "After four days of stomach pain, the 13-year-old boy was admitted to Tauranga Hospital on New Zealand's North Island, where doctors discovered the magnets had joined together to form four chains inside his intestines.",
      "Surgeons extracted the magnets and removed parts of the boy's damaged intestines, according to a report by doctors at the hospital, published Friday in the New Zealand Medical Journal.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the report, had swallowed \u201capproximately 80\u2013100 5x2mm high-power neodymium magnets\u201d a week prior to his hospitalization, the doctors said. He was discharged after spending eight days in the hospital.",
      "New Zealand banned the sale of small, high-powered magnets in 2013, after the government warned that children could suffer serious injuries if they swallowed the magnets, whether out of curiosity or while playing with them as \u201cmock jewellery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThough these magnets tend to be marketed at adults as office toys and many brands carry strict safety warnings, it is clear from the cases here and overseas that they pose too great a risk to children,\u201d Simon Bridges, then New Zealand\u2019s consumer affairs minister, said in a statement at the time, citing previous child hospitalizations in the U.S. and Australia.",
      "However, the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal report noted that enforcing the long-standing ban remains challenging, as the magnets can still be easily purchased through online marketplaces.",
      "\u201cWhile these laws can be enforced locally, it is more difficult to regulate products supplied by overseas merchants on large-scale online marketplaces,\u201d the authors said.",
      "\u201cThese platforms are easily accessible especially by children, with purchases being inexpensive and not always requiring age verification,\u201d they added.",
      "The report said that the magnets had been purchased via the Chinese online marketplace Temu. In a statement to NBC News, Temu said it has not yet been able to confirm whether the magnets in question were purchased through its platform.",
      "\u201cWe are sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery,\u201d Temu\u2019s spokespersons said.",
      "\u201cWe take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\u201d they said.",
      "The marketplace platform said it has reached out to the New Zealand Medical Journal for more details on the case, and its teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure they meet local safety standards, adding that any noncompliant products will be removed and sellers found violating platform rules or local laws will face firm action."

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan tries to placate President Donald Trump amid contentious trade talks, officials may be eyeing an icon of American manufacturing that has virtually no presence there: The Ford F-150 pickup truck.",
      "Trump, who is visiting the key U.S. ally next week as part of his first trip to Asia since returning to office, has long criticized the lack of American vehicles sold in Japan, citing what he believes are non-tariff barriers.",
      "Japanese auto brands such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Subaru are ubiquitous in the United States, where Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Cars are Japan\u2019s top export to the U.S., though according to JAMA most Japanese cars sold there are actually assembled in North America.",
      "By contrast, Japanese brands account for more than 90% of new cars sold in Japan, which imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",
      "In August, Trump suggested that there would soon be a market in Japan for American cars, specifically the Ford F-150.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re taking the very beautiful Ford 150, which does very well and I\u2019m sure will do very well there,\u201d he told CNBC. The model has long been the best-selling vehicle in America, according to industry outlets.",
      "Reuters reported this week that Ford F-150s were part of a purchase package being finalized to present to Trump during talks in Tokyo next week, citing two sources with knowledge of the preparations. It said the trucks might be used in Japan as snow plows.",
      "Local media in Japan have also said the government is considering buying the trucks.",
      "Japanese officials have not confirmed the reports, and the new trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, was not asked about them at his first news conference on Friday.",
      "Akazawa, who was previously Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator with the U.S., said earlier this month that while Trump\u2019s frequent mentions of the Ford F-150 suggested they were a \u201cfavorite\u201d of his, he did not have information to share on any potential purchases by the Japanese government.",
      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",
      "Many of the vehicles sold in Japan are mini or \u201ckei\u201d cars that are far smaller and more fuel efficient than the ones produced by American automakers. They are required by law to be no more than about 11.2 feet long and 4.9 feet wide, compared with the F-150 which is typically more than 17 feet long and 6.6 feet wide.",
      "European vehicles are also far more popular in Japan than American ones, accounting for more than 200,000 imports last year. The top-selling European car brand in Japan is Mercedes-Benz.",
      "\u201cUnlike European car companies, Ford and General Motors (GM) don\u2019t have dedicated port facilities or dealerships,\u201d Smitka said in emailed comments. \u201cThey\u2019d be very expensive to import, expensive to market, and because there\u2019s no network, expensive to service.\u201d",
      "Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In 2016, the company said that it would close all operations in Japan, saying it had struggled to gain market share and saw \u201cno reasonable path to profitability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t try to sell pickups because they understand the market,\u201d Smitka said.",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:15:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Russia reacted with outrage after President Donald sanctioned Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil.",
    "story": [
      "Russia reacted with outrage Thursday after the United States imposed substantial sanctions on its two largest oil companies, the first economic punishments slapped on Moscow by President Donald Trump during his second term.",
      "Experts said it remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this move may damage the Russian economy or Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine, as Trump hopes to pressure Moscow to halt its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Days after canceling a planned summit with Putin, citing a lack of progress in the negotiations, Trump took the major step by effectively blacklisting Rosneft and Lukoil.",
      "The announcement was welcomed by Kyiv and its European allies, which added their own new raft of sanctions on Moscow, earning the ire of Russian officials and the state-controlled media.",
      "Speaking to journalists at the Kremlin on Thursday, Putin called the sanctions an \"unfriendly act\" but quickly brushed off their likely impact. \"They are serious in nature and will have certain consequences, but they will not have a significant impact on the health of our economy,\" he said.",
      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

    "story": [
      "Top U.S. officials have hit out at the Israeli parliament's move toward annexing the already occupied West Bank, labeling it an \u201cinsult\u201d that could damage Washington's efforts to keep the Gaza ceasefire on track and build toward a more lasting peace deal.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that if the vote in the Knesset was a \u201cpolitical stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally took some insult to it.\u201d Speaking with reporters, Vance called the vote \u201cweird\u201d and said, \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t happy about it.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio separately warned Wednesday night as he prepared to depart for Israel that the Knesset's actions could imperil President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict. Rubio was set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Thursday.",
      "A bill seeking to apply Israeli law to the West Bank, a move seen as amounting to annexation of the land that Palestinians view as part of a future state, gained preliminary approval from Israel\u2019s parliament earlier Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a vote in the Knesset, but obviously I think the president\u2019s made clear that\u2019s not something we\u2019d be supportive of right now,\u201d Rubio told reporters late Wednesday on the tarmac.",
      "Vance, meanwhile, maintained that \"the West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel,\" adding that that was the \"policy of the Trump administration\" and that it would \"continue to be our policy.\"",
      "In a statement after their comments, Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the vote was a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\" during Vance's visit to Israel.",
      "It said Netanyahu's Likud party did not vote for the bills, except for one \"disgruntled\" member who it said was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee. \"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it said.",

      "Time magazine reported that Trump said in an interview over the phone last week that Israel \u201cwould lose all of its support\u201d from the United States if it annexed the West Bank.",
      "\"It won\u2019t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries,\" he said. \"It will not happen. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.\"",
      "Rubio was the latest U.S. official to make his way to Israel in recent days, on the heels of Vance, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "On Wednesday, Vance sought to emphasize that U.S. officials were not flocking to Israel to babysit the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after a flare-up in violence raised fears the truce could collapse. He stressed that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions around the next steps in Trump\u2019s peace plan grew.",
      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire. The two sides also clashed over delays in returning hostage bodies held by Hamas and ongoing barriers to aid access in the enclave.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast War, and it has defended the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, but much of the international community views them as illegal.",
      "A rise in settler violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have been viewed as directly imperiling the Palestinian cause and as major impediments to resolving the decadeslong conflict.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Music met medicine when a patient played a clarinet solo as she underwent brain surgery for Parkinson's disease and proved that the treatment was working in real time.",
      "Denise Bacon, 65, saw her finger movements improve instantly during four hours of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery \u2014 all while staying awake and performing on the musical instrument, London's King\u2019s College Hospital said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "The retired speech and language therapist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2014, She has since suffered difficulties walking, swimming, dancing and playing her beloved clarinet as the  progressive neurological disorder that affects movement has taken hold of her body.",
      "To help Bacon get these abilities back, Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery, performed DBS on her, implanting electrodes in Bacon's brain and tracking her body\u2019s reaction in real time.",
      "\u201cStimulating electrodes are placed into the deep structures of the brain,\u201d Ashkan said in the hospital\u2019s news release, adding that it was \u201ca long-established procedure to improve motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders.\u201d",
      "Although the brain itself has no pain receptors, Bacon was given local anesthetic to numb her scalp and skull, as doctors made holes half the size of a small coin in her skull and implanted the stimulating electrodes inside.",
      "A pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, was then connected to the electrodes to send targeted electrical signals to the brain.",
      "\u201cAs a keen clarinetist, it was suggested Denise bring her clarinet into the operating theatre to see whether the procedure would improve her ability to play, which was one of Denise\u2019s main goals for the surgery,\u201d Ashkan said.",
      "An amateur musician, Bacon played the instrument with the East Grinstead Concert Band until Parkinson\u2019s symptoms made it impossible for her to continue five years ago.",
      "However, as she played during the surgery, she noticed an immediate improvement in her hand movements.",
      "\u201cI remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,\u201d she said in the news release.",
      "Brain surgeries usually require general anesthesia, but certain procedures require the patient to be awake so doctors can ensure they aren't damaging vital brain functions.",
      "It is not the first procedure of this kind to be performed by Ashkan at King\u2019s College Hospital. In 2020, a violinist played jazz classics as a tumor was removed from her brain.",
      "Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.",
      "For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King\u2019s College Hospital said in the release."
