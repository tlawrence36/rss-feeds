      "So vividly drawn is Stephen King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stephen King \u2019s first editor, Bill Thompson, once said, \u201cSteve has a movie camera in his head.\u201d",
      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Cynthia Erivo will release her sophomore solo album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- It began as it always should, with her voice.",
      "The second solo album from Cynthia Erivo, fresh off a herculean press run with the success of the first \u201cWicked\u201d film, was always meant to be \u201cvocal-focused,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. It may be the understatement of a lifetime: to know her is to know her instrument \u2014 that range, the notes few else can hit but many attempt.",
      "And Erivo's new soulful album, the evocatively titled \u201cI Forgive You,\" hits the mark.",
      "In the studio, that meant using her vocals \u201cas the pads, as the stacking,\u201d like an artist might with a guitar or piano. \u201cThe meat of each of the pieces that you listen to is the voice,\u201d she says, \u201cSo that you can hear the lyrics, you can hear the song, you can hear the emotion in it,\u201d she explains. The other instruments, too, were performed live. \"Everything you hear in there is real and tangible.\u201d",
      "For that reason \u2014 and other expressions of autonomy take across the album \u2014 she says it felt like her first. For the listener, it evokes a real feeling of intimacy.",
      "Erivo spoke to the AP about \u201cI Forgive You,\u201d life after \u201cWicked\" and the forthcoming \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d and the ways in which acting, singing and writing inform one another.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "ERIVO: This album is a collection of stories and songs that are both personal for things that are happening now, things that have happened in the past, and I think some of which I have had to forgive people for. And honestly, some of which I\u2019ve had to forgive myself for. And I loved the idea of calling it this title, because it\u2019s a simple concept, but not an easy one. And not one that we as humans are very good at, often.",
      "A part of me was feeling, like, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people had to keep repeating the words, 'I forgive you?'\u201d So even if you\u2019re finding it difficult to say this album will give you the permission to actually say the words, even if you\u2019re not quite ready.",
      "ERIVO: The concept of being a work in progress \u2014 who still gets scared of things, who still has to deal with things \u2014 that won\u2019t ever necessarily stop. It might get quiet, but that feeling doesn\u2019t necessarily always go away. I just wanted to be honest, and I think that \u201cReplay\u201d was probably the first song that I put out was because I felt like it was sort of a reintroduction to the inner part of me that most people might not really know.",
      "But it\u2019s also a tricky song in that it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of upbeat, and if you actually listen, you hear that there\u2019s like a person who\u2019s a little bit fragile, a person whose trying to figure some things out, a person who\u2019s been through some things, who\u2019s dealt with things, who has abandonment issues, who has fear, who an inferiority complex sometimes, who wants to help everyone, who wants to save everyone, but gets it wrong.",
      "Those are human, human things that I want to share.",
      "ERIVO: No apprehension about writing it, a little apprehension about sharing it, because it\u2019s honest. But once it\u2019s done, what can you do? It\u2019s time to share.",
      "ERIVO: They feed each other. When I sing, I feel free and I feel open, which means that when I go and act \u2014 because I\u2019ve given myself that experience \u2014 the want to close off again sort of goes away. So, when I\u2019m on a set, I\u2019m as open as I am when I am singing. I\u2019m waiting to receive whatever I\u2019m getting from my counterpart or whoever\u2019s opposite me so I can actually listen. Because the act of writing and singing actually is also the act of listening.",
      "ERIVO: I had a sort of level of anonymity that I think I got used to and I really kind of enjoyed. That isn\u2019t necessarily there anymore, which is still really lovely because people are kind and sweet, and I\u2019m really grateful for it. But that\u2019s an adjustment, to realize that you can\u2019t just walk into a store and no one will know who you are, or you can\u2019t get on a plane, and no one will there you are. That\u2019s a new thing that I didn\u2019t expect or wasn't seeking.",
      "ERIVO: We have a couple pickups and then we\u2019re done.",
      "ERIVO: I\u2019m so proud of it. We spent a lot of time on it. We worked really, really hard on it. There was no stone unturned on it because I love what I do, and I love music, and I loved making it.",
      "So just know that this was made with a lot of love.",

      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers.",
      "For TNT's Kenny Albert, it is another accomplishment in a year that has been filled with many, especially over the past nine months.",
      "Wednesday's Game 1 between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will be Albert's 1,483rd call in hockey, football or baseball for a national network. He moved past his father, the legendary Marv Albert, into fourth place among North American announcers during last Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final between Florida and Carolina.",
      "\u201cTo be listed along with some of the all-time greats who I watched growing up and then got to know a lot of them personally, it\u2019s a proud moment when you see that you\u2019re included in that group,\u201d Albert said. \u201cMy schedule definitely is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle between the various sports and networks, but very fortunate to work for and with so many great people.\u201d",
      "Albert surpassed the 500 games mark in both the NFL and NHL within a six-month period.",
      "He became the first NFL play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games on one network last October when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cleveland Browns in a game televised by Fox. He has been with Fox Sports since its beginning in 1994.",
      "He surpassed 500 national NHL games on Dec. 18 when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the Detroit Red Wings on TNT. Albert has been TNT's top hockey announcer since it got the rights in 2021.",
      "All told, Albert has done 534 NHL, 512 NFL, 421 baseball and 15 NBA games on a national broadcast or cable network. That is on top of his other duties as New York Rangers radio voice and backup for New York Knicks television games on MSG Network.",
      "Albert's versatility to do a plethora of different sports was something he picked up from his father. Even though Marv Albert's signature sport was the NBA, he also did the NFL and NHL along with hosting the baseball pregame show during the late 1980s on NBC.",
      "\u201cI've always loved the variety,\u201d Kenny Albert said.",
      "For all of the aforementioned accomplishments, though, the highlight of Albert's year so far was calling Alex Ovechkin's 895th NHL goal on April 6 to break Wayne Gretzky's career record. Albert's call during the second period, when the Washington Capitals star set the record against the New York Islanders, relayed excitement while also mentioning the goal number and then going silent so that the crowd and scenes from the crowd could take over.",
      "\u201cIn a championship situation or big moment, I don't usually write something out, but I do throw some words around in my mind just to be ready,\u201d Albert said. \"I was thinking something with his nickname, the Great Eight, the great Gretzky. When he tied the record, Joe Beninati (the Capitals TV announcer) used something similar to that, so I wanted to shift over to something else and not use some of the same words he did.",
      "\u201cWhen it happened, it just came out naturally. I mentioned No. 895 and then I just got out of the way. It was very important after the call to just lay out and let the production folks do their thing. Let the pictures and sound tell the story.\u201d",
      "According to TV database research compiled by Un/Necessary Sports Research, the late Bob Cole, who called the games for CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d for 50 years, leads the way at 1,722 (all hockey) games; followed by Dick Stockton, who did basketball, baseball and football for CBS and Fox, with 1,544; and Canadian play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert with 1,539. Cuthbert, the current lead voice for \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d will surpass Stockton if the Stanley Cup Final goes six games.",
      "Kevin Harlan is sixth at 1,477 and should surpass Marv Albert (1,481) for fifth during Week 5 of the upcoming NFL season.",
      "This will be the 11th Stanley Cup Final for Albert, including eight on radio, but the first where he has called a rematch from the previous year. This is the first final rematch since the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009 and the second over the past 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt has a chance to be one of the all-time great championship series,\" Albert said. \"These same teams played a scintillating seven-game series last June. Star power on both sides. Edmonton attempting to win Canada\u2019s first Cup since 1993. Florida looking to repeat. Can Connor McDavid match Wayne Gretzky and Sidney Crosby and win his first Stanley Cup against the team that beat his club in the Cup Final the year before? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

      "British writer Bernardine Evaristo has won the Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Bernardine Evaristo doesn't like boundaries.",
      "For the Booker Prize -winning novelist, rules about genre, grammar or what a working-class biracial woman can achieve are all to be challenged and swept away.",
      "Evaristo was announced Wednesday as recipient of the 100,000-pound ($135,000) Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature and her unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices.\"",
      "Evaristo, 66, received the prize both for her work to help promote women and writers of color, and for writing that takes in poetry, a memoir and seven novels including the Booker-winning \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just go wherever my imagination takes me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write the kind of novels that would take you on a predictable emotional or moral journey.\u201d",
      "Evaristo had already explored autobiographical fiction, historical settings and alternate realities when she won the Booker in 2019 for \u201cGirl Woman, Other,\u201d a polyphonic novel told from the point of view of a dozen characters, largely Black women, with widely varying ages, experiences and sexualities.",
      "She was the first woman of African heritage to be awarded the prize, which was founded in 1969 and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers.",
      "When she won, Evaristo was 60 and had been a writer for decades. She says the recognition \u201ccame at the right time for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well if I was younger,\u201d she told The Associated Press at her London home. \u201cIt changed my career \u2013- in terms of book sales, foreign rights, translation, the way in which I was viewed as a writer. Various other opportunities came my way. And I felt that I had the foundations to handle that.\u201d",
      "Evaristo\u2019s house on a quiet suburban street is bright and comfortable, with wooden floors, vibrant textiles and a large wooden writing desk by the front window. Large photos of her Nigerian paternal grandparents hang on one wall. Her work often draws on her roots as the London-born child of a Nigerian father and white British mother.",
      "Like much of Evaristo\u2019s work, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d eludes classification. She calls it \u201cfusion fiction\u201d for its melding of poetry and prose into a novel that relishes the texture and rhythm of language.",
      "\u201cI kind of dispense with the rules of grammar,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have 12 full stops in the novel.\u201d",
      "If that sounds dauntingly experimental, readers didn\u2019t think so. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d has sold more than 1 million copies and was chosen as one of Barack Obama\u2019s books of the year.",
      "Evaristo traces her love of poetry to the church services of her Catholic childhood, where she soaked up the rhythms of the Bible and sermons, \u201cwithout realizing I was absorbing poetry.\u201d",
      "When she started writing novels, the love of poetry remained, along with a desire to tell stories of the African diaspora. One of her first major successes, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Babe,\u201d is a verse novel set in Roman Britain.",
      "\u201cMost people think the Black history of Britain only began in the 20th century,\u201d Evaristo said. \u201cI wanted to write about a Black presence in Roman Britain -\u2013 because there was a Black presence in Roman Britain 1,800 years ago.\u201d",
      "Another novel, \u201cBlonde Roots,\u201d is set in an alternative historical timeline in which Africans have enslaved Europeans, and was nominated for a major science-fiction award.",
      "\u201cMr Loverman,\u201d which centers on a closeted gay 70-something Antiguan Londoner, was an attempt to move beyond cliched images of Britain\u2019s postwar Caribbean immigrants. It was recently made into a BBC television series starring Lennie James and Sharon D. Clarke.",
      "Her latest award is a one-off accolade marking the 30th anniversary of the annual Women\u2019s Prizes for English-language fiction and nonfiction.",
      "Women\u2019s Prize founder Kate Mosse said Evaristo\u2019s \u201cdazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career made her the ideal recipient.\u201d",
      "Evaristo, who teaches creative writing at Brunel University of London, plans to use the prize money to help other women writers through an as-yet undisclosed project.",
      "She has long been involved with projects to level the playing field for under-represented writers, and is especially proud of Complete Works, a mentoring program for poets of color that she ran for a decade.",
      "\u201cI set that up because I initiated research into how many poets of color were getting published in Britain at that time, and it was under 1%\u201d of the total, she said. A decade later, it was 10%.",
      "\"It really has helped shift the poetry landscape in the U.K.,\" she said.",
      "Evaristo followed \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d with \u201cManifesto,\u201d a memoir that recounts the stark racism of her 1960s London childhood, as well as her lifelong battle for creative expression and freedom.",
      "If Evaristo grew up as an outsider, these days she is ensconced in the arts establishment: professor, Booker winner, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, and president of the 200-year-old Royal Society of Literature.",
      "That milestone -\u2013 she\u2019s the first person of color and the second woman to head the RSL -\u2013 has not been trouble-free. The society has been ruffled by free speech tows and arguments over attempts to bring in younger writers and diversify its ranks -\u2013 moves seen by some as watering down the accolade of membership.",
      "Evaristo doesn\u2019t want to talk about the controversy, but notes that as figurehead president she does not run the society.",
      "She says Britain has come a long way since her childhood but \u201cwe have to be vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe country I grew up in is not the country I\u2019m in today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress, and I feel that we need to work hard to maintain it, especially in the current political climate where it feels as if the forces are against progress, and proudly so.",
      "\u201cWorking towards an anti-racist society is something that we should value, and I hope we do, and that we don\u2019t backslide too much.\u201d",

      "While Joss\u2019 husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire, San Antonio police have said they\u2019ve found \u201cno evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss\u2019 murder was related to his sexual orientation.\u201d Police did not respond to multiple emails on Tuesday seeking additional information on the cause of the shooting.",

      "\u201cWe may have lost our home, but not our hope. We\u2019re moving forward with love, humor, and a little elbow grease\u2026and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support,\u201d Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.",

      "In a statement, de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire, Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in accidents.",
      "U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton also ordered Girardi, 86, to pay a $35,000 fine and $2.3 million in restitution to former clients. A jury in August found him guilty of four counts of wire fraud, and he could have been sentenced to up to 80 years in prison.",
      "Girardi is the estranged husband of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Erika Jayne and appeared on the show himself dozens of times between 2015 and 2020.",
      "He was once among the most prominent lawyers in the nation, often representing victims of major disasters against powerful companies. One lawsuit against California\u2019s Pacific Gas and Electric utility led to a $333 million settlement and was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d",
      "But his law empire collapsed, and he was disbarred in California in 2022 over client thefts.",
      "Girardi has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and issues with his memory led another court to put him in a conservatorship under his brother. But on Monday, Staton ruled that he was mentally competent to be sentenced, just as she had previously found him mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "The judge had allowed him to remain free until his sentencing but ordered him to surrender to authorities by July 17.",
      "An email to Girardi\u2019s attorney seeking comment on the conviction was not immediately answered.",
      "Former clients who testified against Girardi at his trial included an Arizona woman whose husband was killed in a boat accident and victims who were burned in a 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, south of San Francisco.",
      "Prosecutors played jurors voicemails in which Girardi gave a litany of false reasons money that a court had awarded could not be paid, including tax and debt obligations and judge authorizations. He frequently told them, \u201cDon't be mad at me.\u201d",

      "The invitation comes as Jimmy Donaldson\u2019s reported $5 billion media empire surpasses 400 million subscribers on YouTube, where he had already set the record for the biggest following.

      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",

      "Scientists say a new planetarium show about the Milky Way has helped them unlock one of the solar system\u2019s many secrets",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have unlocked one of the solar system's many secrets from an unexpected source: a planetarium show opening to the public on Monday.",
      "At the American Museum of Natural History last fall, experts were hard at work preparing \u201cEncounters in the Milky Way,\" a deep dive into our home galaxy shaped by the movements of stars and other celestial objects.",
      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum\u2019s educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\u201d planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show, narrated by actor Pedro Pascal, features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker \u2014 including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\u201cYou just never know what you're going to find,\u201d Emmart said.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off.

      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him.

      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",

      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",
      "\u201cDue to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira\u2019s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park,\u201d the Capital Pride Alliance statement said. \u201cDespite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.\u201d",
      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",
      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",
      "Capital Pride Alliance Executive Director Ryan Bos said that security fencing would be installed surrounding the final two-day concert and rally on a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Early hotel reservation numbers for the final World Pride weekend, June 6-8, were originally down from the previous year, according to Destination D.C., which tracks reservations.",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "A law firm says the number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000",
      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris",
      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",
      "After the death of his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, he remarried, to Simone Harari Baulieu. He is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, his institute said.",

      "Attorneys for a woman who sued Kentucky seeking to restore the right to an abortion have dropped their challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which had represented the woman, said in a statement it would not give additional details about the dismissal.",
      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday dismissed Russia\u2019s ceasefire proposal as \u201can ultimatum\u201d and renewed his call for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock over the war, which has dragged on for nearly 3\u00bd years.",
      "Both sides exchanged memorandums setting out their conditions for a ceasefire for discussion at Monday's direct peace talks between delegations in Istanbul, their second meeting in just over two weeks. Both sides have established red lines that make any quick deal unlikely.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the second round of talks in Istanbul was no different from the first meeting on May 16. Zelenskyy described the latest negotiations in Istanbul as \u201ca political performance\u201d and \u201cartificial diplomacy\u201d designed to stall for time, delay sanctions and convince the United States that Russia is engaged in dialogue.",
      "\u201cThe same ultimatums they voiced back then \u2014 now they just put them on paper ... Honestly, this document looks like spam. It\u2019s spam meant to flood us and create the impression that they\u2019re doing something,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his first reaction to the Russian document.",
      "He added that the 2025 talks in Istanbul carry \u201cthe same content and spirit\u201d as the fruitless negotiations held in the Turkish city in the early days of the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said that he sees little value in continuing talks at the current level of delegations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov led the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, while Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, headed the Russian team.",
      "Zelenskyy said he wants a ceasefire with Russia before a possible summit meeting with Putin, possibly also including U.S. President Donald Trump, in an effort to remove obstacles to a peace settlement. The U.S. has led a recent diplomatic push to stop the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "\u201cWe are proposing \u2026 a ceasefire before a leaders\u2019 summit,\u201d with the U.S. acting as a mediator, Zelenskyy told a media briefing in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWhy a ceasefire before the leaders\u2019 meeting? Because if we meet and there is no mutual understanding, no willingness or vision on how to end this, then the ceasefire would end that same day. But if we see readiness to continue the dialogue and take real steps toward de-escalation, then the ceasefire would be extended with U.S. mediation guarantees,\u201d he said.",
      "Ukraine is ready to meet at any time from next Monday at a venue such as Istanbul, the Vatican or Switzerland, Zelenskyy said.",
      "A second round of peace talks on Monday between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul lasted just over an hour and made no progress on ending the war. They agreed only to swap thousands of their dead and seriously wounded troops.",
      "Also, a new prisoner exchange with Russia could take place over the weekend, Zelenskyy said.",

      "The war in Ukraine and the existential threat that Russia poses to European security has topped NATO\u2019s agenda in each of its summits since 2022",
      "BRUSSELS -- The war in Ukraine and the existential threat that Russia poses to European security has dominated NATO\u2019s agenda in each of the summits the military alliance has held since Moscow launched its invasion in 2022.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sat at the head of NATO\u2019s table and been uniformly praised for his leadership. Ukraine\u2019s place within the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest military organization seemed assured once the war was over.",
      "But three weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump and his NATO counterparts gather in the Netherlands, it remained unclear whether Zelenskyy would even get a seat, or how much support Ukraine might win in the final summit communique.",
      "Asked on Wednesday about Ukraine\u2019s role at the top-level meeting on June 24-25 in The Hague, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said only that it \u201cwill be discussed and on the agenda.\u201d",
      "Ahead of previous summits, NATO envoys have a labored to craft statements that encompass Ukraine\u2019s \u201cirreversible path to membership,\u201d with enduring pledges of support, while insisting that Russia poses the greatest threat to NATO security.",
      "Asked whether Zelenskyy would be invited this time, Rutte said that the meeting program would be available soon. A NATO-Ukraine Council -\u2013 standard fare at recent summits -\u2013 will not be held, so it\u2019s unclear how he would take part if he was.",
      "Invited to comment on Ukraine\u2019s covert weekend drone attack in Russia -\u2013 described as the most significant of the war by some officers and experts -\u2013 Rutte said: \u201cI take note,\u201d underlining only that the drones had hit military targets.",
      "Responding to a similar question on Wednesday, Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said: \u201cThis war needs to come to an end.\u201d He said Trump \u201cfeels very strongly about that\u201d and sees no military solution to end the war.",
      "What is clear is that Trump will take center-stage in The Hague, along with his demand that all 32 NATO allies invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense. Zelenskyy should not be allowed to steal the limelight.",
      "\u201cA new defence investment plan will be at the heart of the NATO summit in The Hague,\u201d said Rutte, speaking on the eve of a meeting of the organization\u2019s defense ministers at its Brussels headquarters.",
      "He said this should involve \u201ca huge increase in defense spending to make sure that we can keep ourselves safe, not only now, but also in the future.\u201d Rutte said defense companies \u201cneed to know that we are spending more\u201d so they will ramp up production.",
      "Whitaker said that the 5% target \u201cis not going to be a pledge \u2014 this is going to be a commitment.\u201d He said that the U.S. wants to see concrete plans, budgets and timelines from European allies and Canada on how they intend to get there.",
      "He told reporters that the defense industries of NATO allies \u201cmust outpace\u201d Russia. He added: \"We have no choice. Let me be clear: the time is now.\u201d",
      "NATO's members are weighing a demand from Rutte that they each spend 3.5% of GDP on defense by 2032, plus a further 1.5% on military-related infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, airfields and ports.",
      "Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain are not yet spending 2%, though Spain expects to reach that goal this year.",
      "Without a strong show of support for Ukraine at the summit -\u2013 and the acknowledgement that Russia remains NATO\u2019s biggest security threat -\u2013 some member nations may struggle to convince voters of the need to boost defense spending at the expense of other budget demands.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Four former senior fire service and civil protection officials were jailed in Greece Wednesday after being found guilty for failing to mount a proper evacuation in a wildfire that killed more than 100 people outside Athens in 2018. A former fire chief, his deputy, and head of a disaster coordination center were each sentenced to serve five years in prison for causing loss of life though negligence, along with a former director of the government's civil protection agency. The July 23, 2018, fire swept through the seaside area of Mati, east of Athens, forcing residents into a chaotic attempt to escape \u2014 either by car through a dense forest or fleeing into the sea. The court in Athens ruled that the officials had failed to organize an orderly evacuation. The defendants were initially found guilty in a trial that concluded last year and not jailed, but a senior prosecutor challenged the verdict, leading to a retrial. Greece is battling an increasing number of serious wildfires annually, which are blamed by authorities on the effects of climate change.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Dutch opposition parties called Wednesday for fresh elections as soon as possible, a day after anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders sparked the collapse of the country's four-party coalition government.",
      "Prime Minister Dick Schoof's 11-month-old administration fell apart when Wilders withdrew his Party for Freedom ministers. Schoof and the ministers of three remaining parties remain in power as a caretaker Cabinet.",
      "The government, with limited powers, now has to lead the country for months before new elections and during what could \u2014 again \u2014 be protracted talks to cobble together a new coalition in the fragmented Dutch political landscape after the vote.",
      "Lawmakers can declare some policy areas \u201ccontroversial\u201d during the caretaker period. That restricts the government from taking concrete action on those issues.",
      "The Dutch electoral commission will schedule a general election for all 150 seats in the Second Chamber of parliament.",
      "It is very unlikely to happen before the fall because of a parliamentary recess that starts July 4 and runs to Sept. 1 and that will be followed by several weeks of campaigning.",

      "But Schoof acknowledged that some other policies will be put on ice until there is a new coalition.",
      "\u201cThe last thing we want now is postponement, but it is unavoidable in some cases,\u201d he said.",
      "They want to go to the polls.",
      "\u201cI hope we can organize elections as quickly as possible, in the shortest possible time,\u201d said Frans Timmermans, the former European Commissioner who now leads a two-party, center-left bloc.",
      "Timmerman's bloc of the Labor Party and Green Left is challenging Wilders' party for top spot in Dutch polls. Wilders won the last elections in November 2023.",
      "Lawmakers used Wednesday's debate to attack Wilders for failing to make good while in office on his 2023 election pledges \u2014 in what sounded like a proxy electoral debate.",

      "An Australian woman on trial for the triple murder of her estranged husband's relatives and the attempted murder of another has told the Supreme Court in the state of Victoria that she carefully planned the July 2023 lunch where her dinner guests were ...",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Before Erin Patterson\u2019s in-laws and their relatives arrived at her home for lunch, she bought pricey ingredients, consulted friends about recipes and sent her children out to a movie.",
      "Then, the Australian woman served them a dish containing poisonous death cap mushrooms \u2014 a meal that was fatal for three of her four guests.",
      "Whether that was Patterson\u2019s plan is at the heart of a triple murder trial that has gripped Australia for nearly six weeks.",
      "Prosecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say the accused lured her guests to lunch with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi.",
      "But her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington she served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap. She denies murdering her estranged husband\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson.",
      "The mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.",
      "On Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch in July 2023 and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn't become sick herself.",
      "No one disputes that Patterson, 50, served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.",
      "Patterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \u201csomething special\u201d to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \u201cbland\u201d flavor, she said.",
      "She believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.",
      "\"Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\u201d she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.",
      "Patterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \u201churt\u201d when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d attending.",
      "She earlier told his relatives that she'd arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.",
      "In reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.",
      "\u201cI was ashamed of the fact that I didn\u2019t have control over my body or what I ate,\u201d a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell anybody, but I shouldn\u2019t have lied to them.\u201d",
      "The accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.",
      "Patterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.",
      "At the hospital where her guests' health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.",
      "\u201cIs that how you poisoned my parents?\u201d she said Simon Patterson asked her.",
      "Growing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she\u2019d never owned one and hadn\u2019t foraged for mushrooms before.",
      "While still at the hospital, she insisted she'd bought all the mushrooms at stores even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.",
      "She was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.",
      "Also later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cell phone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she\u2019d foraged.",
      "Prosecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband\u2019s family on purpose, although they didn't suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.",
      "The trial continues on Thursday with Patterson's cross-examination by the prosecutors. If convicted, she faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder.",

Committee against Torture expressed concern over a \u201cvery high rate\u201d of prison overcrowding in Ivory Coast, and criticized the condition, including poor sanitation, a lack of ventilation and inadequate quality food and water.

      "BANGKOK -- A hungry wild elephant caused havoc in a grocery store in Thailand on Monday when he strolled in from a nearby national park and helped himself to food on the shelves.",
      "Videos of the incident showed the huge male elephant, known as Plai Biang Lek, briefly stopping in front of the shop, located next to a main road near the Khao Yai National Park in northeastern Thailand, before ducking his whole body inside.",
      "The elephant stopped in front of the shop\u2019s counter, calmly snatching and chomping snacks, and did not flinch as the national park workers tried to shoo him away.",
      "The elephant later backed out of the shop still holding a bag of snacks with his trunk. He left little damage behind, except mud tracks on the floor and the ceiling of the shop.",
      "In a video posted on social media, Kamploy Kakaew, the shop owner, appeared amused as she described the moment the elephant rifled her shop. She said he ate about nine bags of sweet rice crackers, a sandwich and some dried bananas she had bought that morning.",
      "Kamploy said the elephant left without hurting anyone after getting his snacks.",
      "Danai Sookkanthachat, a volunteer park worker familiar with the elephant, said Plai Biang Lek, who is about 30 years old, is a familiar sight in the area and has been known to enter people\u2019s houses in search of food. This was the first time he had seen him going into a grocery store.",

      "There were an estimated 4,000 wild elephants in Thailand in 2024, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. As farmers push into forests for agriculture, elephants have been forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food, leading to confrontations that can turn deadly.",

      "BEIJING -- For most Chinese, the 36th anniversary of a bloody crackdown that ended pro-democracy protests in China passed like any other weekday. And that's just how the ruling Communist Party wants it.",
      "Security was tight Wednesday around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Under then-leader Deng Xiaoping, the military was sent in to end the protest on the night of June 3-4. Using live ammunition, soldiers forced their way through crowds on the streets that tried to block them from reaching the square. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed, including dozens of soldiers.",
      "The party has tried, with some success, to erase what it calls the \u201cpolitical turmoil\u201d of 1989 from the collective memory. It bans any public commemoration or mention of the June 4th crackdown, scrubbing references from the internet.",
      "In recent years, that ban has been extended to Hong Kong, where a once-massive annual candlelight vigil is no longer permitted. A former district council member, Chan Kim-kam, said customs officers questioned her at her shop on the eve of June 4 after she advertised small white candles for sale in an Instagram post titled, \u201cJune, we don't forget.\u201d",

      "University students occupied this symbolically important site in the spring of 1989. Their calls for freedoms divided the party leadership. In retrospect, the decision to send in the troops marked a decisive turning point in the evolution of modern China, keeping the party firmly in control as it loosened economic restrictions.",
      "Chinese officials have said the country\u2019s rapid economic development since then proves the decisions made at the time were correct.",
      "\u201cOn the political turmoil that happened in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has already reached a clear conclusion,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday. He added that China would continue along its current path of what it calls \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\"",
      "Tiananmen Mothers, a group formed by relatives of the victims, made an annual online appeal to the government. Signed by 108 members, it called for an independent investigation into what happened on June 4, 1989, including a list of all who died. The group also demanded compensation for the families and a legal case against those responsible for the deaths.",
      "The British and German Embassies in Beijing posted videos commemorating the anniversary on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, but they were later taken down, presumably by censors. The Canadian and German Embassies displayed images of a single lit candle on large screens facing the main street.",
      "In Hong Kong, a carnival showcasing Chinese food and products was held in Victoria Park, where tens of thousands of people used to gather in the evening for a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary.",
      "Hong Kong authorities first shut down the vigil during the COVID-19 pandemic and arrested the organizers in 2021. The moves were part of a broader crackdown on dissent following monthslong anti-government protests in 2019 that turned violent and paralyzed parts of the city.",
      "\u201cYou know, Hong Kongers have become silent lambs after 2019,\u201d said King Ng, who was at the park on Wednesday.",
      "Police were out in force to try to prevent any protest. Activist Lui Yuk-lin was stopped at a subway station in Causeway Bay and brought to a police van. It wasn't clear if she had been arrested.",
      "Jailed vigil organizer Chow Hang-tung said she would go on a 36-hour hunger strike to remember the events of the day.",
      "The British and Canadian consulates posted social media messages about not forgetting June 4. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. The American consulate posted a message from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on its website.",

      "Despite the country\u2019s strikingly high household debt, the central bank last week lowered borrowing costs in a desperate bid to inject more money into the economy and slashed its 2025 growth forecast to 0.8%, which would be the weakest since a 0.7% contraction during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020.",
      "Lee won\u2019t have much time to negotiate with Washington before July 9, when Trump\u2019s 90-day pause in global reciprocal tariffs is set to expire, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates.",
      "Although a U.S. federal court recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose his planned tariffs, the White House has appealed, leaving the outcome uncertain. Trump has also pushed for product-specific tariffs on key sectors like autos and semiconductors, which make up a major share of South Korean exports. Trump could also seek a broader deal requiring Seoul to pay significantly more for the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean threats.",
      "While Seoul\u2019s previous government had aimed to reach a \u201cpackage\u201d deal with Trump by early July, Lee has preached patience on tariffs, saying it would be against national interests to obsess with an early agreement.",
      "In his inaugural address, Lee promised to reopen a communication channel with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for the early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas are dim, as North Korea has been constantly rejecting dialogue offers by South Korea and the U.S. since 2019, when talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over disagreements on economic sanctions.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its warfighting in Ukraine.",
      "During campaigning, Lee acknowledged that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to arrange a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon, though it\u2019s something he will seek. Lee said he would support Trump\u2019s efforts to restart nuclear diplomacy with Kim, saying that improved ties between Pyongyang and Washington could allow aid projects for the impoverished North that will likely require South Korean support.",
      "Lee nominated former Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok, a dove who espouses reconciliation with North Korea, as his spy chief. The nomination likely reflects Lee Jae-myung\u2019s hopes to revive inter-Korean dialogue, given the behind-the-scene roles of the National Intelligence Service played to reach out to Pyongyang under the past liberal governments.",
      "However, many experts also note that Lee Jae-myung does not share the same level of Korean nationalist zeal as his liberal predecessors, and they question how firmly he would stick to his appeasement approach if provocative actions by North Korea, such as high-profile missile tests or border incursions, undermine public support for his policy at home.",
      "Lee was previously accused by his critics of tilting toward Pyongyang and Beijing and away from Washington and Tokyo. He once slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties  to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said eventually helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula.",
      "But Lee has recently refrained from making similar contentious comments, instead repeatedly pledging to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has vowed to enhance South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. and their trilateral cooperation with Japan, while also emphasizing the need to reduce tensions with North Korea and avoid frictions with China and Russia.",
      "While Lee may eventually take steps to improve ties with North Korea and China \u2014 relations that deteriorated under Yoon, who prioritized the U.S. and Japan \u2014 experts say Lee is unlikely to take drastic actions that might undermine the alliance with Washington or negatively impact South Korea's financial markets.",
      "Lee has stated that he will address thorny historical disputes with Japan separately from matters of security, trade, and other issues. However, many experts believe he is unlikely to completely reverse the progress made in Seoul-Tokyo relations in recent years. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Wednesday that he hopes to hold summit talks with Lee \u201cas early as possible\u201d and expressed a desire to further strengthen bilateral ties.",
      "Long accused by critics of being a divisive populist, Lee pledged unity throughout his campaign, vowing not to target conservatives and calling for an end to South Korea\u2019s deep political polarization and a return to dialogue and compromise.",
      "However, he has also pledged a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yoon\u2019s martial law stunt \u2014 a saga that could continue to overshadow Lee\u2019s presidency and spark tensions with conservatives, especially as the ousted conservative faces a high-stakes criminal trial on rebellion charges punishable by death or life imprisonment.",
      "While Yoon defended his martial law decree as a necessary response to what he called the Democratic Party\u2019s abuse of its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda, that same majority now gives Lee a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that this could give Lee partially unchecked power and enable him to advance legislation that shields his presidency from his own legal troubles.",
      "Lee faces five separate trials on corruption and other charges, but the hearings were suspended ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. While South Korea\u2019s constitution shields sitting presidents from most criminal prosecution aside of rebellion or treason, it doesn\u2019t clearly state whether this protection extends to preelection indictments. The Democrats have been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to keep Lee\u2019s trials suspended during his term, drawing criticism from conservatives.",

      "More than 20,000 residents are being evacuated from part of Cologne\u2019s city center to defuse World War II bombs",
      "COLOGNE, Germany -- More than 20,000 residents were being evacuated from part of Cologne's city center on Wednesday as specialists prepared to defuse three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II that were unearthed earlier this week.",
      "Even 80 years after the end of the war, unexploded bombs dropped during wartime air raids are frequently found in Germany.",
      "Disposing of them sometimes entails large-scale precautionary evacuations such as the one on Wednesday, though the location this time was unusually prominent and this is Cologne's biggest evacuation since 1945. There have been bigger evacuations in other cities.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday morning started evacuating about 20,500 residents from an area within a 1,000-meter (3,280-foot) radius of the bombs, which were discovered on Monday during preparatory work for road construction. They were found in the Deutz district, just across the Rhine River from Cologne's historic center.",
      "As well as homes, the area includes 58 hotels, nine schools, several museums and office buildings and the Messe/Deutz train station. It also includes three bridges across the Rhine \u2014 among them the heavily used Hohenzollern railway bridge, which leads into Cologne's central station and is being shut during the defusal work itself. Shipping on the Rhine will also be suspended.",
      "The plan is for the bombs to be defused during the course of the day. When exactly that happens depends on how long it takes for authorities to be sure that everyone is out of the evacuation zone.",

      "Images from the election of South Korea's new president are as peaceful and orderly as you\u2019d expect to see in any vibrant democracy",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Images from the election of South Korea's new president, liberal Lee Jae-myung, are everything you\u2019d expect to see in one of the world\u2019s most vibrant democracies.",
      "Peaceful. Orderly. And, because this is South Korea, compulsively eye-catching, with crowds singing raucously along to blaring K-pop, dancers bouncing in closely choreographed sequences, and color-coordinated outfits for the two front-runners and their supporters \u2014 blue for Lee, who was inaugurated Wednesday for a single, five-year term, red for the distant runner-up, conservative Kim Moon Soo.",
      "What the pictures don\u2019t capture is the absolute turmoil of the past six months, making Tuesday one of the strangest \u2014 and, possibly, most momentous -- election days since the country emerged in the late 1980s from decades of dictatorship.",
      "Since Dec. 3, South Koreans have watched, stunned, as an extraordinary sequence of events unfolded: Then-South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, a first since the dictatorship. In response, lawmakers, leaping fences and jostling with heavily armed soldiers, elbowed their way into a besieged parliament to vote the declaration down. Yoon was then impeached and removed from office and now, just two months after his fall, another president has taken office.",
      "Here is a look at Lee\u2019s victory, the startling events that set up the election, and the challenges Lee faces to heal a nation split along a host of political and social fault lines.",
      "They are, in a way, older than the nation.",
      "The Korean Peninsula was initially divided into a Soviet-backed north and U.S.-backed south after World War II. The states formalized the division in 1948, and the 1950-53 Korean War made it permanent, dividing the rivals along the Demilitarized Zone, one of the most heavily armed borders in the world.",
      "But the tensions go beyond geography. During the long fight for democracy during South Korea's dictatorships, several fractures arose that persist today: the contentions between liberals and conservatives, but also gaps between rich and poor, old and young and men and women.",
      "Since the end of dictatorship, over and over the country has seen its democracy tested.",
      "By its own leaders.",
      "By its antagonistic neighbor to the north.",
      "By each new generation\u2019s reaction to a tumultuous history of forced geographic division, war, dictatorship, and one of the most breakneck economic turnarounds in world history.",
      "Preceding Tuesday\u2019s election, thousands of protesters took to the streets, both supporting the deposed Yoon and denouncing him.",
      "\u201cAbove all, the president must bring unity among a divided and confused public, which was caused by the martial law declaration,\u201d Park Soo Hyun, a 22-year-old student, said Wednesday.",
      "Lee's party has a majority in parliament that will presumably allow the new president a freer hand in pushing through liberal legislation, including more funding for welfare programs and policies to address high living costs, joblessness and corruption.",
      "Typically, liberals like Lee have been more wary of South Korea's traditional allies, the United States and Japan, than conservatives. They have also often looked for reconciliation with North Korea.",
      "The United States sees South Korea as a crucial buttress against China and Russia and North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear capabilitie s. The South hosts nearly 30,000 U.S. troops.",
      "Lee, however, will have to find a way to keep his liberal base happy while managing the relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened Seoul with tariffs and has generally been lukewarm about the importance of the alliance.",
      "Lee has also been dogged by a raft of corruption cases, and it\u2019s not yet clear how much of a drag those will be on his presidency.",
      "\"I will make sure there is no more military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, in which the power entrusted by the people would never be used to intimidate people,\u201d Lee said in his victory speech early Wednesday morning, referring to the martial law decree.",
      "Experts say it's a little of both. The last half-year has worsened already raw divisions, even as it highlighted the underlying strength of a rough-and-tumble democratic process.",
      "\u201cFierce ideological divisions still infuse politics, which could impede South Korea\u2019s chances to grow into a truly mature democracy,\" Duyeon Kim, a visiting professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, wrote recently for the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "But Tuesday\u2019s vote and Wednesday\u2019s inauguration signaled a return to a more normal democracy.",
      "And even the crisis itself showed the resiliency of South Korea's institutions.",
      "A crowd helped lawmakers get past troops and into parliament to overturn the martial law decree. The soldiers who carried out Yoon\u2019s orders did so without enthusiasm and didn\u2019t use force against the people, John Delury, a Korea expert and visiting professor at John Cabot University, said Tuesday.",
      "Korean democracy is in the people\u2019s hands, he said, not any one person\u2019s, even the new president's. Lee \u201centers office with a strong mandate. But he is not the savior of democracy,\" said Delury. \"Korean people saved it themselves. Now they are entrusting him not to do any more damage to it for the next five years.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Muslims from around the world are in the Saudi city of Mecca for the Hajj, one of the Five Pillars of Islam.",
      "In the coming days, people will immerse themselves in religious rituals and acts of worship that originated more than 1,400 years ago.",
      "They also have to contend with excess heat and other earthly factors, like a ban on children under the age of 12 and a crackdown on unauthorized entry.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about this year\u2019s Hajj:",
      "Last year\u2019s pilgrims struggled through burning sun and suffocating hot weather, with the mercury hitting 47 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit). More than 1,300 people died.",
      "This year, Saudi authorities are advising caution in direct sunlight, telling pilgrims to avoid going out during the day and uncovering their heads, except for rituals, unless necessary.",
      "An official safety kit emphasizes the importance of light-colored clothing and umbrellas. It also has details on recognizing and treating the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion.",
      "But it\u2019s tough to avoid the heat and crowds when the Hajj is outdoors. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many, elevating the personal stakes further, and temperatures in Mecca are already 41 degrees Celsius (about 106 Fahrenheit).",
      "Although the desert kingdom spends billions of dollars on crowd control and cooling, the sheer number of pilgrims and climatic conditions make it difficult to guarantee people\u2019s safety.",
      "Saudi Arabia has banned children under 12 from this year\u2019s Hajj \u2014 one of the biggest policy changes in recent years.",
      "Riyadh reportedly introduced the ban as a precautionary measure to ensure children\u2019s safety during the pilgrimage, which could be a dangerous environment for them because of the huge crowds.",
      "Children are exempt from doing the Hajj and are not required to fulfill other Islamic obligations, like prayer and fasting, until they reach puberty.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t stop some parents from wanting to take their children to experience the Hajj and see the holiest site in Islam, the Kaaba, the black, cube-shaped structure that is the focal point for daily prayers.",
      "Father of five Talha Ayub, from the Pakistani city of Lahore, said his kids were staying with their grandparents while he and his wife performed the Hajj in a \u201cmore relaxed way.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if children were allowed, we probably wouldn\u2019t have taken them because the weather is extremely harsh this year,\u201d said Ayub, whose children are aged 1 to 13. \u201cI have mixed feelings about leaving them behind. I\u2019ll miss them.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no official age breakdown for pilgrims, but most are between 35 and 64.",
      "The price of a Hajj ranges from $4,000 to $20,000, depending on the length of stay, level of comfort, and country of departure. Depreciating currencies, high inflation, and tax hikes in Saudi Arabia also have an impact on how much Muslims end up paying.",
      "The countries that typically send the most pilgrims are developing nations. Some have trimmed the price of government-backed Hajj programs to make them more affordable. But this step isn\u2019t always enough.",
      "Farid Ahmed Majumder, secretary general of the Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, said the country was allowed to send some 127,000 pilgrims this year but failed to meet this quota, mainly because of higher costs.",

      "He paid in three installments, applying for the Hajj in December with an advance and finishing his payments in February. \u201cOtherwise, I might not have been able to go for Hajj at all,\u201d he said.",

      "But the Hajj has limited capacity, countries have set quotas, and there is only one time each year to do it. Patience really is a virtue and everything needs to align: availability, health, and finances.",

      "On the rural islands of Nagasaki a handful of believers practice a version of Christianity that has direct links to a time of samurai, shoguns and martyred missionaries and believers",
      "IKITSUKI, Japan -- On this small island in rural Nagasaki, Japan\u2019s Hidden Christians gather to worship what they call the Closet God.",
      "In a special room about the size of a tatami mat is a scroll painting of a kimono-clad Asian woman. She looks like a Buddhist Bodhisattva holding a baby, but for the faithful, this is a concealed version of Mary and the baby Jesus. Another scroll shows a man wearing a kimono covered with camellias, an allusion to John the Baptist\u2019s beheading and martyrdom.",
      "There are other objects of worship from the days when Japan\u2019s Christians had to hide from vicious persecution, including a ceramic bottle of holy water from Nakaenoshima, an island where Hidden Christians were martyred in the 1620s.",
      "Little about the icons in the tiny, easy-to-miss room can be linked directly to Christianity \u2014 and that\u2019s the point.",
      "After emerging from cloistered isolation in 1865, following more than 200 years of violent harassment by Japan\u2019s insular warlord rulers, many of the formerly underground Christians converted to mainstream Catholicism.",
      "Some, however, continued to practice not the religion that 16th century foreign missionaries originally taught them, but the idiosyncratic, difficult to detect version they\u2019d nurtured during centuries of clandestine cat-and-mouse with a brutal regime.",
      "On Ikitsuki and other remote sections of Nagasaki prefecture, Hidden Christians still pray to these disguised objects. They still chant in a Latin that hasn\u2019t been widely used in centuries. And they still cherish a religion that directly links them to a time of samurai, shoguns and martyred missionaries and believers.",
      "Now, though, the Hidden Christians are dying out, and there is growing certainty that their unique version of Christianity will die with them. Almost all are now elderly, and as the young move away to cities or turn their backs on the faith, those remaining are desperate to preserve evidence of this offshoot of Christianity \u2014 and convey to the world what its loss will mean.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m afraid we are going to be the last ones,\u201d said Masatsugu Tanimoto, 68, one of the few who can still recite the Latin chants that his ancestors learned 400 years ago. \u201cIt is sad to see this tradition end with our generation.\u201d",
      "Christianity spread rapidly in 16th century Japan when Jesuit priests had spectacular success converting warlords and peasants alike, most especially on the southern main island of Kyushu, where the foreigners established trading ports in Nagasaki. Hundreds of thousands, by some estimates, embraced the religion.",
      "That changed after the shoguns began to see Christianity as a threat. The crackdown that followed in the early 17th century was fierce, with thousands killed and the remaining believers chased underground.",
      "As Japan opened up to foreign influence, a dozen Hidden Christians clad in kimono cautiously declared their faith, and their remarkable perseverance, to a French Catholic priest in March 1865 in Nagasaki city.",
      "Many became Catholics after Japan formally lifted the ban on Christianity in 1873.",
      "But others chose to stay Kakure Kirishitan (Hidden Christians), continuing to practice what their ancestors preserved during their days underground.",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Hidden Christians spoke of a deep communal bond stemming from a time when a lapse could doom a practitioner or their neighbors.",
      "Hidden Christians were forced to hide all visible signs of their religion after the 1614 ban on Christianity and the expulsion of foreign missionaries. Households took turns hiding precious ritual objects and hosting the secret services that celebrated both faith and persistence.",
      "This still happens today, with the observance of rituals unchanged since the 16th century.",
      "The group leader in the Ikitsuki area is called Oji, which means father or elderly man in Japanese. Members take turns in the role, presiding over baptisms, funerals and ceremonies for New Year, Christmas and local festivals.",
      "Different communities worship different icons and have different ways of performing the rituals.",
      "In Sotome, for instance, people prayed to a statue of what they called Maria Kannon, a genderless Bodhisattva of mercy, as a substitute for Mary.",
      "In Ibaragi, where about 18,000 residents embraced Christianity in the 1580s, a lacquer bowl with a cross painted on it, a statue of the crucified Christ and an ivory statue of Mary were found hidden in what was called \u201ca box not to be opened.\u201d",
      "Many Hidden Christians rejected Catholicism after the persecution ended because Catholic priests refused to recognize them as real Christians unless they agreed to be rebaptized and abandon the Buddhist altars that their ancestors used.",
      "\u201cThey are very proud of what they and their ancestors have believed in\u201d for hundreds of years, even at the risk of their lives, said Emi Mase-Hasegawa, a religion studies professor at J.F. Oberlin University in Tokyo.",
      "Tanimoto believes his ancestors continued the Hidden Christian traditions because becoming Catholic meant rejecting the Buddhism and Shintoism that had become a strong part of their daily lives underground.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a Christian,\u201d Tanimoto said. Even though some of their Latin chants focus on the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ, their prayers are also meant to \"ask our ancestors to protect us, to protect our daily lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not doing this to worship Jesus or Mary. \u2026 Our responsibility is to faithfully carry on the way our ancestors had practiced.\u201d",
      "Hidden Christians\u2019 ceremonies often include the recitation of Latin chants, called Orasho.",
      "The Orasho comes from the original Latin or Portuguese prayers brought to Japan by 16th century missionaries.",
      "Recently on Ikitsuki, three men performed a rare Orasho. All wore dark formal kimonos and solemnly made the sign of the cross in front of their faces before starting their prayers \u2014 a mix of archaic Japanese and Latin.",
      "Tanimoto, a farmer, is the youngest of only four men who can recite Orasho in his community. As a child, he regularly saw men performing Orasho on tatami mats before an altar when neighbors gathered for funerals and memorials.",
      "About 40 years ago, in his mid-20s, he took Orasho lessons from his uncle so he could pray to the Closet God that his family has kept for generations.",
      "Tanimoto recently showed the AP a weathered copy of a prayer his grandfather wrote with a brush and ink, like the ones his ancestors had diligently copied from older generations.",
      "As he carefully turned the pages of the Orasho book, Tanimoto said he mostly understands the Japanese but not the Latin. It\u2019s difficult, he said, but \u201cwe just memorize the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Today, because funerals are no longer held at homes and younger people are leaving the island, Orasho is only performed two or three times a year.",
      "There are few studies of Hidden Christians so it\u2019s not clear how many still exist.",
      "There were an estimated 30,000 in Nagasaki, including about 10,000 in Ikitsuki, in the 1940s, according to government figures. But the last confirmed baptism ritual was in 1994, and some estimates say there are less than 100 Hidden Christians left on Ikitsuki.",
      "Hidden Christianity is linked to the communal ties that formed when Japan was a largely agricultural society. Those ties crumbled as the country modernized after WWII, with recent developments revolutionizing people\u2019s lives, even in rural Japan.",
      "The accompanying decline in the population of farmers and young people, along with women increasingly working outside of the home, has made it difficult to maintain the tight networks that nurtured Hidden Christianity.",
      "\u201cIn a society of growing individualism, it is difficult to keep Hidden Christianity as it is,\u201d said Shigeo Nakazono, the head of a local folklore museum who has researched and interviewed Hidden Christians for 30 years. Hidden Christianity has a structural weakness, he said, because there are no professional religious leaders tasked with teaching doctrine and adapting the religion to environmental changes.",
      "Nakazono has started collecting artifacts and archiving video interviews he's done with Hidden Christians since the 1990s, seeking to preserve a record of the endangered religion.",
      "Mase-Hasegawa agreed that Hidden Christianity is on its way to extinction. \u201cAs a researcher, it will be a huge loss,\u201d she said.",
      "Masashi Funabara, 63, a retired town hall official, said most of the nearby groups have disbanded over the last two decades. His group, which now has only two families, is the only one left, down from nine in his district. They meet only a few times a year.",
      "\u201cThe amount of time we are responsible for these holy icons is only about 20 to 30 years, compared to the long history when our ancestors kept their faith in fear of persecution. When I imagined their suffering, I felt that I should not easily give up,\u201d Funabara said.",
      "Just as his father did when memorizing the Orasho, Funabara has written down passages in notebooks; he hopes his son, who works for the local government, will one day agree to be his successor.",
      "Tanimoto also wants his son to keep the tradition alive. \u201cHidden Christianity itself will go extinct sooner or later, and that is inevitable, but I hope it will go on at least in my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my tiny glimmer of hope.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae-myung says he\u2019ll pursue dialogue with North Korea while bolstering a trilateral partnership with the U.S. and Japan",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s new President Lee Jae-myung vowed Wednesday to restart dormant talks with North Korea and bolster a trilateral partnership with the U.S. and Japan, as he laid out key policy goals for his single, five-year term.",
      "Lee, who rose from childhood poverty to become South Korea\u2019s leading liberal politician vowing to fight inequality and corruption, formally began his term earlier Wednesday, hours after winning a snap election that was triggered in April by the removal of then-President Yoon Suk Yeol over his ill-fated imposition of martial law late last year.",
      "In his inaugural address at the National Assembly, Lee said that his government will deal with North Korean nuclear threats and its potential military aggressions with \u201cstrong deterrence\u201d based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance. But he said he would \u201copen a communication channel with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula through talks and cooperation.\u201d",
      "He said he\u2019ll pursue pragmatic diplomacy with neighboring countries and boost trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation based on the robust South Korea-U.S. alliance.",
      "\"Through pragmatic diplomacy based on national interests, we will turn the crisis posed by the major shift in global economic and security landscapes into an opportunity to maximize our national interests,\u201d Lee said.",
      "It was unclear whether Lee\u2019s election would cause any major, immediate shift in South Korea\u2019s foreign policy. Lee, previously accused by critics of tilting toward China and North Korea and away from the U.S. and Japan, has recently repeatedly stressed South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of its foreign policy and avoided any contentious remarks that would raise questions on his views on the U.S. and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to now see if the pressures of office will cause Lee Jae-myung to govern from the center \u2014 at least when it comes to matters of national security and the alliance with the United States,\u201d said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "The toughest external challenges awaiting Lee are U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy and North Korea\u2019s expanding military partnerships with Russia. But experts earlier said whoever becomes president can\u2019t do much to secure major progress in South Korea\u2019s favor on those issues.",
      "During his inauguration speech, Lee didn\u2019t directly mention trade issues with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. and Japan said they congratulated Lee\u2019s election and expressed their commitments to developing three-way cooperation.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he wants to hold summit talks with Lee \u201cas early as possible,\u201d saying he hopes to further promote bilateral ties, both public and commercial. The U.S. State Department said that Seoul and Washington share \u201can ironclad commitment\u201d to the alliance grounded in their mutual defense treaty, shared values and deep economic ties.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how North Korea would react to Lee\u2019s speech, as it has shunned any talks with South Korea since 2019. North Korea in recent years has supplied weapons and troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, and South Korea, the U.S. and their partners suspect Russia might in return transfer high-tech technologies to North Korea to help it perfect its nuclear weapons program.",
      "Russia\u2019s Tass news agency said Wednesday that one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s top security officials, Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, has arrived in Pyongyang for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in the latest sign of the countries\u2019 alignment over Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Lee said revitalizing a slowing domestic economy would be his top priority and that his government would immediately launch an emergency task force to wage a \u201chead-on battle\u201d against the threats of recession. He also promised more aggressive government spending to help spur economic activity.",
      "South Korea\u2019s central bank last week cut its key interest rate and sharply lowered its growth outlook for 2025 to 0.8%, as it moved to counter Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by recent political turmoil.",
      "Lee also called for unity to address the country\u2019s stark political divide deepened after Yoon's martial law debacle, saying that he will \u201canswer the people\u2019s solemn call to let hope bloom over deep and painful wounds.\" Lee still promised a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition, describing it as a \u201crebellion that seized people\u2019s sovereignty with arms.\u201d",
      "Yoon and some of his top military and police officers already stand trial on high-stakes rebellion charges in connection with martial law. Lee's push to bring those involved in Yoon's martial law stunt accountable has subsequently caused speculations among his opponents that he would launch political revenge against Yoon associates and senior prosecutors whom he previously accused of fabricating evidence to initiate criminal charges against him.",
      "Lee faces five trials on corruption and other allegations, but experts say those trials will likely stop during his term because the South Korean constitution gives a sitting president immunity from most criminal prosecutions.",
      "Lee also reiterated his campaign vows to reduce inequality and pledged to address the imbalance between the greater Seoul capital area and less developed regions. He said that \u201cthe polarization fueled by inequality is now hindering further growth.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s term began immediately without the usual two-month transition period after the National Election Commission formally confirmed his election victory.",

      "Three former Salvadoran officers have been convicted for the 1982 killings of four Dutch journalists during the Central American nation\u2019s civil war",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Three former Salvadoran military officers were convicted by a five-person jury late Tuesday for the 1982 killings of four Dutch journalists during the Central American nation\u2019s civil war. They received 15-year prison sentences.",
      "A jury made up of five women convicted the three men of murder in a lightning trial that began Tuesday morning in the northern city of Chalatenango, said Oscar P\u00e9rez, lawyer for the Foundation Comunicandonos that represented the victims' families. P\u00e9rez said prosecutors had requested minimum 15-year prison sentences for all three.",
      "Convicted were former Defense Minister Gen. Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Garc\u00eda, 91, former treasury police director Col. Francisco Mor\u00e1n, 93, and Col. Mario Adalberto Reyes Mena, 85, who was the former army commander of the Fourth Infantry Brigade in Chalatenango.",
      "Garc\u00eda and Mor\u00e1n are under police guard at a private hospital in San Salvador, while Reyes Mena lives in the United States. In March, El Salvador\u2019s Supreme Court ordered that the extradition process be started to bring him back.",
      "P\u00e9rez said that in addition to the convictions of the former high-ranking officers, the judge condemned the government for the delayed justice and ordered the commander in chief of the armed forces, President Nayib Bukele, to issue a public apology to the victims.",
      "The Dutch TV journalists \u2014 Jan Kuiper, Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemson \u2014 had linked up with leftist rebels and planned to spend several days behind rebel lines reporting. But Salvadoran soldiers armed with assault rifles and machine guns ambushed them and the guerrillas.",
      "Garc\u00eda was deported from the U.S. in 2016, after a U.S. judge declared him responsible for serious human rights violations during the early years of the war between the military and the leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front guerrillas.",
      "The prosecution of the men was reopened in 2018 after the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a general amnesty passed following the 1980-1992 war.",
      "It moved slowly, but in March 2022, relatives of the victims and representatives of the Dutch government and European Union demanded that those responsible for killing Jan Kuiper, Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemson be tried.",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp welcomed the convictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an important moment in the fight against impunity and in the pursuit of justice for the four Dutch journalists and their next of kin,\u201d Veldkamp said in a message on X.",
      "\u201cGrateful to the authorities of El Salvador and to all those who have worked tirelessly on this case,\u201d he added.",
      "The United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador, which was set up as part of a U.N.-brokered peace agreement in 1992, concluded there was clear evidence that the killings were the result of an ambush set up by Reyes Mena with the knowledge of other officials, based on an intelligence report that alerted of the journalists\u2019 presence.",
      "Other members of the military, including Gen. Rafael Flores Lima and Sgt. Mario Canizales Espinoza were also accused of involvement, but died. Canizales allegedly led the patrol that carried out the massacre of the journalists.",
      "Juan Carlos S\u00e1nchez, of the nongovernmental organization Mesa Contra la Impunidad, in comments to journalists, called the trial a \u201ctranscendental step that the victims have waited 40 years for.\u201d",
      "An estimated 75,000 civilians were killed during El Salvador\u2019s civil war, mostly by U.S.-backed government security forces.",
      "The trial was closed to the public.",

      "The second option described by Moscow as the \u201cpackage\u201d proposal, presses Ukraine to halt its mobilization efforts and freeze Western arms deliveries \u2014 conditions that were suggested earlier by Putin.",
      "On top of that, the document also demands that Ukraine begin demobilizing its military, halt any redeployment of forces and ban the presence of any third-country forces on its soil.",
      "The \u201cpackage\u201d option further proposes that Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the two countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty.",
      "The Russian document declares that conditions for peace must include the \u201cinternational legal recognition\u201d of Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and its 2022 annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.",
      "It says a future peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, and abandon its bid to join NATO. The document demands that Ukraine limit the size of its armed forces, recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian, ban \u201cglorification and propaganda of Nazism and neo-Nazism\u201d and dissolve nationalist groups -\u2013 conditions reflecting Putin\u2019s goals from the outset of his invasion.",
      "The false allegations that neo-Nazi groups were shaping Ukraine\u2019s politics under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, have been vehemently dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "In Russia\u2019s view, a comprehensive peace treaty should also see both countries lift all sanctions and restrictions, abandon any claims to compensation for wartime damage, resume trade and communications, and reestablish diplomatic ties. It also suggests that the peace treaty between Russian and Ukraine be endorsed by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "The memorandum that Ukraine submitted to Moscow before the talks and shared with its allies emphasized the need for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to set stage for peace negotiations.",
      "It reaffirmed Ukraine's consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance.",
      "It emphasized Kyiv's rejection of any restrictions on the size and other parameters of its armed forces, as well as curbs on the presence of foreign troops on its soil.",
      "Ukraine's memorandum also opposed recognizing any Russian territorial gains, while describing the current line of contact as a starting point in negotiations.",
      "The document noted the need for international security guarantees to ensure the implementation of peace agreements and prevent further aggression.",

      "Stanovaya said Moscow\u2019s maximalist demands mean that \u201cthe fighting is set to continue, even if bilateral interactions persist.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Bulgaria has the green light to join the euro next year and become the 21st member of the European Union's currency union",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- European Union officials gave the green light Wednesday for Bulgaria to become the 21st member of the euro currency union,, a key EU project aimed at deepening the ties between member countries.",
      "The Balkan country of 6.4 million people is to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1.",
      "Here are basic facts about the currency union, also called the eurozone, and how countries join it.",
      "The euro is a shared currency and monetary system launched in 1999 when 11 EU member countries irrevocably fixed their currencies to the euro as an accounting currency, then swapped out the national notes and coins in 2002.",
      "The EU established the European Central Bank to handle monetary policy and set interest rate benchmarks for member countries, similar to the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the U.S.",
      "Countries must meet four criteria: low inflation, keeping deficits and debt under control, low long-term interest rates and a stable exchange rate between their currency and the euro. Countries must go through a two-year \u201cwaiting room\u201d in which their currency does not fluctuate excessively against the euro. The process is meant to demonstrate that their economies are sustainably converging with that of the eurozone.",
      "Once the European Commission determines that requirements have been met, the member governments of the EU decide by what's called a qualified majority vote. Approval needs a minimum of 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.",
      "After joining, countries face rules limiting debt and deficits. Those rules are intended to keep countries from running large deficits that could undermine the euro.",
      "The European Commission ruled Wednesday that Bulgaria has met the requirements, seconded by an opinion from the ECB. The matter now goes to a vote at a meeting of EU finance ministers slated for July 8. EU officials say the vote is a done deal.",
      "Bulgaria is unusual in that it pegged its currency, the lev, to the euro right from the beginning of monetary union in 1999, even before it joined the European Union in 2007. Bulgaria also has very low levels of debt, only 24.1% of annual economic output. That is well below the 60% level set in the economic criteria for eurozone membership. The last step was getting inflation below the benchmark of 2.8%, or no more than 1.5% higher than the average of the three lowest eurozone members.",
      "There were concerns about the level of corruption and money laundering in the EU's poorest country. The commission and the ECB found however that Bulgaria has made progress in those areas.",
      "The most recent Eurobarometer poll carried out by the EU showed that 50% of Bulgarians were opposed and 43% in favor. Reasons include fears of inflation, distrust of official institutions in a country that has had seven governments in four years, and widespread misinformation on social media.",
      "The issue has been taken up by pro-Russian nationalist politicians who argue for keeping the national currency. President Rumen Radev stoked anti-euro forces with a proposal for a referendum, which was rejected by parliament. Misinformation included false claims that the euro would allow EU officials to confiscate dormant bank accounts or use a digital euro to control people.",
      "On Jan.1, only euros will be dispensed from cash machines, though both currencies will circulate in cash for a month. After that, lev notes can be exchanged at banks for 12 months and for an unlimited time at the Bulgarian national bank.",
      "In theory, the euro brings means lower interest rates for business and consumers and eases cross-border trade within the eurozone. Companies no longer have to engage in currency exchange transactions or worry that exchange rate shifts will erode their profits or holdings. Travelers no longer have to pay commissions at an exchange booth or on their credit card bill when vacationing or on a business trip to another EU country.",
      "Member countries get a seat on the ECB\u2019s rate-setting council and so have a voice in eurozone-wide monetary policy.",
      "Countries that join lose some authority over their own economy. They give up their ability set their own interest rates, and face restrictions on government spending and deficits, though those rules have proved flexible in practice. And they can no longer gain competitiveness relative to other countries by allowing their currency's exchange rate to devalue.",
      "Bitter memories remain of the debt and economic crisis that shook the eurozone in 2010-2015. After Greece admitted its deficit and debts were much larger than previously reported, it wound up defaulting on its debts and market turmoil spread to other eurozone countries.",
      "Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus were bailed out with loans by the other eurozone governments, in return for strict austerity measures that impacted many ordinary people including government workers and retirees.",
      "ECB President Mario Draghi is credited with defusing the eurozone crisis in 2012 by saying that the central bank would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. The ECB then said it could intervene in bond markets to support countries hit by turmoil, a safeguard that calmed markets even though it was never used.",
      "Later other backstops were added, including a eurozone bailout fund and moving banking oversight from sometimes-lax national supervisors to the ECB.",
      "Countries agree to join the euro as part of joining the EU, but not all have made the effort to meet the economic requirements. There is no time window to join.",
      "Denmark was granted an opt out, while Sweden rejected the euro in a 2003 referendum despite not having an opt out and has no target date to join. Other non-members are Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.",
      "Officials in Poland, the biggest non-member, have shown little interest in joining despite acknowledging the obligation to join someday. The winner of Sunday's presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, campaigned on keeping the zloty currency.",
      "The country's economy has grown strongly without euro membership, doubling in size over the past two decades as its standard of living has almost caught up with Western Europe since emerging from communist rule in 1989.",

      "The regional court said on May 6 that the deal could not be signed before it rules on the EDF case, because then there would be no way to change it even if the French company won.",

      "Labubu, the plush toy from China\u2019s Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are not an overnight success",
      "Labubu, the plush toy from China's Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are far from an overnight success. Having appeared a decade ago, Labubus may have finally cemented their place in the collectible toy market for years to come.",
      "The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared with pointed ears and pointy teeth, in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.",
      "In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.",
      "There are 1.4 million #Labubu TikTok posts and counting, videos of fans unboxing them, showing styles inspired by them, and of course, Labubu cosplay.",
      "Fans have latched on to Labubu\u2019s mashup of play and fashion, making them accessories on handbags, backpacks and belts, or hanging them from car mirrors.",
      "\u201cThe character has evolved into a collectible and style symbol, resonating with fans who connect with its quirky aesthetic and unique backstory,\u201d Emily Brough, Popmart\u2019s head of IP licensing in the Americas, said.",
      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart's plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company's annual report.",
      "Aside from their ability to pique the interest of toy aficionados and fashionistas, Labubu latched on to the blind box phenomenon, where the purchaser doesn't know exactly which version of the plush toy they'll get.",
      "And Pop Mart made sure there is a Labubu for everyone, regardless of income. Most are priced in a wide rage between $20 and $300, with certain collaborations or limited editions priced higher, according to Brough.",
      "Unlike many toys, Labubu devotees include a large number of adults. Buyers ages 18 and over drove a year-over-year increase of more than $800 million in the U.S. toy market in 2024, according to market research firm Circana. Adult shoppers, mostly female, bought the toys for themselves. In 2025's first quarter, toy sales for those ages 18 and over rose 12% from the prior-year period. At $1.8 billion, adults also accounted for the highest spending among all age groups in the quarter.",
      "Like many retailers, Pop Mart is actively monitoring negotiations between the U.S. and just about every one of its trading partners as prices may be impacted. The situation with China is at the forefront, with President Donald Trump saying on Friday that the country \u201cviolated\u201d an agreement with the United States on trade talks.",
      "Right now Pop Mart, whose products are manufactured across Asia, says that it is continuously scaling production and expanding distribution across its online shop, retail stores and blind box vending machines to meet increasing demand.",
      "Short supply has led to long lines at stores and at least one physical fight at a shopping center in the United Kingdom. Pop Mart said in an Instagram post late last month that it was temporarily suspending all in-store and blind box machine sales in the U.K. Peter Shipman, head of Europe, said in a Facebook post that the company is currently working on a new method to distribute toys to stores.",
      "Resellers have become problematic and many Labubu fans are still willing to pay exorbitant price markups.",
      "Kena Flynn was at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles recently when she stumbled upon some Labubus being sold at a kiosk. Flynn said in a TikTok on Sunday that the prices were \u201creally bad,\u201d but her boyfriend bought two anyway.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t buy them,\u201d Flynn said in her video. \u201cI just want a Labubu and I cannot buy one from Pop Mart, so here we are.\u201d",
      "Looking to keep up with the overwhelming demand, Pop Mart says it's on track for 50 more retail locations in the U.S. by the end of the year. That'll give shoppers more chances to hunt for Labubus, as Pop Mart says it's planning multiple new Labubu releases tied to seasonal moments and holidays throughout the rest of the year.",

America\u2019s was 2.5% until Trump raised it to 25% in April. The EU has argued its purchases of U.S. services, especially in the technology sector, all but overcome the deficit.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Top Trump administration officials \u2014 fresh off touring one of the country's largest oil fields in the Alaska Arctic \u2014 headlined an energy conference led by the state's Republican governor on Tuesday that environmentalists criticized as promoting new oil and gas drilling and turning away from the climate crisis.",
      "Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.",
      "Calls for additional oil and gas drilling \u2014 including Trump\u2019s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built \u2014 are \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cAlaska is Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cProtect our Public Lands.\u201d",
      "\"We find it really disingenuous that they\u2019re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.",
      "Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich\u2019in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich\u2019in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.",
      "\u201cWhen these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,\u201d Adams said, adding later: \u201cIt's our health that will be impacted. It\u2019s our wellness, our ways of life.\u201d",
      "Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear \u201cto be victims of their surroundings\u201d and seemed \u201chappy.\u201d",
      "Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Wright bristled at the idea of policy \"in the name of climate change\u201d that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.",
      "\u201cYou know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.\u201d",
      "Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.",
      "Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.",
      "Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of \u201cpotential partners.\" Costs surrounding the project \u2014 which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure \u2014 are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.",

      "The White House has officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Tuesday officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending, taking funding away from programs targeted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "It's a process known as \u201crescission,\u201d which requires President Donald Trump to get approval from Congress to return money that had previously been appropriated. Trump's aides say the funding cuts target programs that promote liberal ideologies.",
      "The request, if it passes the House and Senate, would formally enshrine many of the spending cuts and freezes sought by DOGE. It comes at a time when Musk is extremely unhappy with the tax cut and spending plan making its way through Congress, calling it on Tuesday a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d for increasing the federal deficit.",
      "White House budget director Russ Vought said more rescission packages and other efforts to cut spending could follow if the current effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cWe are certainly willing and able to send up additional packages if the congressional will is there,\u201d Vought told reporters.",
      "Here's what to know about the rescissions request:",
      "The request to Congress is unlikely to meaningfully change the troublesome increase in the U.S. national debt. Tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the government is on track to spend roughly $7 trillion this year, with the rescission request equaling just 0.1% of that total.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at Tuesday's briefing that Vought \u2014 a \u201cwell-respected fiscal hawk,\u201d she called him \u2014 would continue to cut spending, hinting that there could be additional efforts to return funds.",
      "\u201cHe has tools at his disposal to produce even more savings,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Vought said he can send up additional rescissions at the end of the fiscal year in September \u201cand if Congress does not act on it, that funding expires.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we are not putting all of our expectations in a typical rescissions process,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview some of the items that would lose funding, said that $8.3 billion was being cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. NPR and PBS would also lose federal funding, as would the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR.",
      "The spokesperson listed specific programs that the Trump administration considered wasteful, including $750,000 to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela, $67,000 for feeding insect powder to children in Madagascar and $3 million for circumcision, vasectomies and condoms in Zambia.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., complimented the planned cuts and pledged to pass them.",
      "\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of DOGE\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, among the chamber\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, said they would like to see additional rescission packages from the administration.",
      "\u201cWe will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,\u201d the group said in a press release. \u201cPassing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress\u2019s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda.\u201d",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, gave the package a less optimistic greeting.",
      "\u201cDespite this fast track, the Senate Appropriations Committee will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations,\u201d the Maine lawmaker said in a statement.",
      "The White House's request to return appropriated funds is meant to comply with the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. That law created the process by which the president can formally disclose to Congress the appropriated money it intends to not spend. Congress generally has 45 days to review and approve the request, but Vought is arguing that the end of the fiscal year would enable the administration to bypass a vote.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said in a 2018 backgrounder that the Senate can pass rescission packages with a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a possible filibuster. Between 1974 and 2000, presidents requested $76 billion worth of rescissions and Congress approved $25 billion.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said in an emailed statement that the Trump administration was already \u201cillegally impounding additional funds,\u201d as withholding money has \u201calways been illegal without explicit Congressional approval.\u201d",
      "On CNN on Sunday, Vought insisted that the Trump administration was complying with the law, but it simply had a different view of the law relative to some Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Vought said. \u201cEvery part of the federal government, each branch, has to look at the Constitution themselves and uphold it, and there\u2019s tension between the branches.\u201d",

      "The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to the restraints the Fed placed on the bank in 2018 for having a toxic sales and banking culture",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to harsh restraints the Fed placed on the bank in 2018 for having a toxic sales and banking culture.",
      "It's a win for Wells Fargo, which has spent nearly a decade trying to convince the public and policymakers that it had changed its ways.",
      "\"We are a different and far stronger company today because of the work we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. Scharf also announced that each of the 215,000 employees at Wells Fargo would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around.",
      "Wells Fargo used to have a corporate culture where it placed unreasonable sales goals on its branch employees, which resulted in employees opening up millions of fake accounts in order to meet those goals. Wells' top executives called its branches \u201cstores\u201d and employees were expected to cross-sell customers into as many banking products as possible, even if the customer did not want or need them.",
      "After an investigation by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, Wells Fargo shut down its sales culture and fired much of its leadership and board of directors. The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo billions of dollars in fines and lost business, and permanently tarnished its reputation, particularly because the scandal broke only a few years after the Great Recession and financial crisis. It was later revealed that Wells Fargo opened up roughly 3.5 million accounts that were not wanted or needed by customers.",
      "Wells Fargo, once thought to be the best run bank in the country, was now the poster child of the worst practices of banking in decades.",
      "In order to push Wells to fix itself, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of placing Wells Fargo in a program where the bank could grow no larger than it was in 2018. No bank had previously been placed into such a program, known as an asset cap. The Fed required Wells to fix it culture and redo its entire risk and compliance departments in order to address its problems.",
      "Since taking over in 2019, Scharf's goal has been to convince the Federal Reserve that Wells Fargo had fixed its toxic banking practices. With the asset cap removed, the bank can now pursue more deposits, new accounts and take on additional investment banking businesses by holding additional securities on its balance shet.",

      "The life of South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is full of ups and downs",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung was a child laborer with an arm deformity. He attempted suicide. He later made his way through university and became a highly divisive politician who survived a stabbing attack and struggles with numerous criminal charges.",
      "His turbulent life climaxed, as Lee, 60, the candidate of the main liberal Democratic Party, was elected as South Korea's new president to succeed his conservative archrival Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his stunning imposition of martial law.",
      "There are both hopes and fears about Lee's win. Supporters think he's an able leader who can get things done and fix the country's deep-rooted economic inequality and corruption. But critics say Lee will likely oppress political opponents and intensify a domestic division.",
      "Here's a look at Lee, whose single, five-year presidency begins on Wednesday:",
      "After graduating from an elementary school, Lee had to work at various factories in Seongnam, a city near Seoul, because his family couldn\u2019t afford his secondary education.",
      "At a factory manufacturing baseball gloves, he had his left forearm crushed by a press machine, getting a permanent arm disability. Lee said he suffered beating at his factories and hated encountering a girl who was a neighbor when he helped his garbage collector father's work at a traditional market.",
      "Despaired, Lee tried to kill himself twice, both unsuccessfully. He later got back on his feet and entered Seoul's Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship, before he became a human rights lawyer.",
      "\u201cHopes and ordeals always come together. The roles of ordeals are not getting people to surrender, but testing how serious and desperate their hopes are,\u201d Lee said in a memoir published in 2017.",
      "Lee later entered politics and became Seongnam mayor and governor of Gyeonggi province. Once a political outsider, Lee rose to prominence in 2016 after he made a series of fiery street speeches criticizing then conservative President Park Geun-hye, who was later removed from office over a corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s seize her with our hands and consign her to history,\" Lee said during one rally in December 2016.",
      "Many of his comments have since sharply polarized South Koreans.",
      "Lee vilified South Korea's conservative establishment as greedy \u201cfake conservatives.\" He slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula later.",
      "Lee's proposal of giving a universal basic income to all citizens have invited accusations that he's a populist.",
      "In 2022, he lost the hotly contested presidential election to Yoon. In 2024, Lee was attacked by a man who told investigators that he wanted to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president.",
      "Recently, Lee has made few contentious or radical comments on foreign policy and security issues, and rather has promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy.",
      "He's repeatedly described South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of the country's foreign policy and stressed the need to maintain a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to what Lee said in the past, we don't know whether he made such comments only to appeal to his supporters or whether they showed his true nature,\u201d said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul\u2019s Myonggi University.",
      "The major issues that Lee will immediately face is U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, and North Korea's advancing nuclear program. They are both vital issues for South Korea, but many experts say there isn't much diplomatic room for South Korea to maneuver in to produce major changes in its favor in both matters.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that Trump is \u201ctoo overwhelming and dominant,\u201d so that whoever is in South Korean leadership, the country's dealings with the U.S. won't be much different. He said that foreign policy advisers for Lee would also know that North Korea won't voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons.",
      "Lee comes to office under the shadow of his own legal troubles.",
      "He stands accused in five trials over corruption and other charges, and at one point, some of his legal battles threatened his bid for presidency.",
      "Lee celebrated in March when the Seoul High Court overturned a suspended prison sentence against him for violating the election law during the 2022 race. But he fumed in May when the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and sent the case back to the high court, citing a strong likelihood of his guilt. Hearings at the high court were eventually postponed until after the election.",
      "Had his conviction been finalized, Lee would have been barred from running for president.",
      "Other trials center around his roles in dubious development projects and illegal money transfers to North Korea, and his alleged misuse of official funds and persuading of a witness to commit perjury.",
      "Lee's five trials will likely stop as South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being charged with most crimes. But his rivals will take issue with it, because the constitution doesn't clearly state whether a president can be convicted for crimes in which indictments came before taking up office.",
      "Lee\u2019s Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, has been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their term. Conservatives have harshly lambasted the move.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Lee vowed not to pursue a vendetta against conservatives. However, he has also called for a thorough investigation into Yoon and his inner circle over rebellion allegations.",
      "Lee's opponents worry he could use those investigations to clamp down on Yoon associates and prosecutors who he thinks orchestrated inquiries involving his criminal charges.",
      "Yoon's martial law stunt intensified a domestic divide.",
      "Declaring martial law, Yoon portrayed Lee's party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces influenced by North Korea and China. He has also endorsed baseless election fraud theories to discredit the liberals\u2019 legislative majority, prompting his angry supporters to pour onto the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs. Anti-Yoon activists and citizens, for their part, also rallied for weeks to demand his immediate dismissal.",
      "With liberals remaining in control of the legislature, Lee faces a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that Lee and the Democratic Party will wield virtually unchecked power to pass legislation previously blocked by Yoon\u2019s administration, including bills aimed at strengthening protections for labor unionists against corporate lawsuits and shielding farmers from volatile rice prices.",

    "story": [
      "Colombia\u2019s wind energy plans in La Guajira are faltering as major companies exit and projects remain stalled",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s ambitious plans for wind energy development, especially in the resource-rich La Guajira region, are facing serious setbacks as major companies pull out and projects stall, industry experts say.",
      "Margarita Nieves, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, told The Associated Press that despite large targets \u2014 including 1.1 gigawatts awarded in a 2019 auction \u2014 only two wind farms are partially operating today, with a combined capacity of less than 32 megawatts.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit estimates the country could generate up to 18 gigawatts of wind energy \u2014 nearly double the nation\u2019s current installed electricity capacity of 20 gigawatts.",
      "Several companies brought equipment and infrastructure to Colombia around 2021 before securing permits, but parks remain unbuilt. Key obstacles include limited grid connection infrastructure in La Guajira, recent regulatory changes that reduce financial returns and complex social and leadership challenges.",
      "Colombia, Latin America\u2019s third-most populous country, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first leftist leader, presents himself as an environmentalist and advocate of a just energy transition. Yet Colombia remains deeply reliant on fossil fuels \u2014 oil is its top export and a major source of government revenue.",
      "In 2023, Italian multinational Enel withdrew from the Windpeshi onshore wind energy project in La Guajira. By late 2024, EDP Renewables canceled two major projects, Alpha and Beta, two large-scale onshore wind farms in the same region. In May, Colombian state-owned oil company Ecopetrol acquired nine solar and wind energy projects from Norway\u2019s Statkraft, marking the European firm\u2019s exit from the country. The portfolio spans La Guajira, Sucre, Cordoba, Caldas, and Magdalena, with a combined potential capacity of 1.3 gigawatts. Only one project is currently operational, with others expected to come online between 2026 and 2027.",
      "The move is part of Ecopetrol\u2019s broader energy transition strategy to reduce reliance on oil and gas and meet net-zero goals by 2050. However, challenges like regulatory delays, governance concerns, and potential impacts on Colombia\u2019s fiscal stability raise questions about the transition\u2019s pace and economic effects.",
      "Nieves warned that the situation is \u201cvery concerning,\u201d with only two of over 20 planned projects advancing. She stressed the need to speed up regulatory processes, improve consultations with Indigenous communities \u2014 notably the Wayuu in La Guajira \u2014 and ensure sufficient electrical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cColombia has more than 20 years of delay in wind energy,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cBrazil, in contrast, has built over 1,300 onshore wind farms in the last two decades and is a top global turbine producer.\"",
      "The wind energy projects were part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its life span, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "For Samuel Lanao, head of La Guajira\u2019s environmental authority, the main reason several licensed renewable energy projects are being sold off is because companies struggle with deep-rooted social tensions, particularly during the prior consultation process with local Indigenous communities. Lanao said confrontations have emerged between firms and residents, derailing expectations of development.",
      "\u201cThis has been a major blow to La Guajira,\u201d he said, \u201cas there were high hopes for economic and social progress through these projects.\u201d",
      "The Wayuu people, a seminomadic Indigenous group in the arid La Guajira region of northern Colombia and Venezuela, remain divided over wind energy development. While some have welcomed the economic support offered by companies building turbines on their ancestral lands, many others have raised concerns over environmental and cultural impacts, and a lack of meaningful prior consultation, in what is one of Colombia\u2019s poorest regions.",
      "Diego Patron, manager of the Jemeiwaa Ka\u2019I wind project, a large-scale wind farm cluster in La Guajira, acknowledged the pioneering nature of Colombia\u2019s early wind efforts, which began in a regulatory vacuum without clear institutional frameworks.",
      "\u201cThese foundational projects faced a steep institutional and territorial learning curve, resulting in the loss of key strategic projects,\u201d Patron said. \u201cHowever, their legacy now forms the cornerstone for new initiatives.\"",
      "Patron believes that barriers around legitimate Wayuu community representation, environmental permitting, and contract resolutions have been overcome, creating more stable conditions.\u201d",
      "Patron said misinformation deepened tensions and unfairly damaged firms like EDP that, he says, aimed to support communities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump wants his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill of tax breaks and spending cuts on his desk to be signed into law by the Fourth of July, and he's pushing the slow-rolling Senate to make it happen sooner rather than later.",
      "Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to nudge, badger and encourage them to act. But it's still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package.",
      "\u201cHis question to me was, How do you think the bill's going to go in the Senate?\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said about his call with Trump. \u201cDo you think there's going to be problems?\u201d",
      "It's a potentially tumultuous three-week sprint for senators preparing to put their own imprint on the massive Republican package that cleared the House late last month by a single vote. The senators have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, including as they returned to Washington late Monday, to revise the package ahead of what is expected to be a similarly narrow vote in the Senate.",
      "\u201cPassing THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL is a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around,\u201d Trump posted on social media. He urged them Monday \u201cto work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY.\u201d",
      "But Trump's high-octane ally, billionaire Elon Musk, lambasted the package \u2014 and those voting for it.",
      "\u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on his site X, as some lawmakers have expressed reservations about the details. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d",
      "Thune, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, has few votes to spare from the Senate's slim, 53-seat GOP majority. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts \u2014 with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we could have everybody on board to do it, but, you know, individual members are going to stake out their positions,\u201d Thune said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cBut in the end, we have to succeed. Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d",
      "At its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.",
      "To defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.",
      "The package also would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's bill \"is ugly to its very core.\u201d",
      "Schumer said Tuesday it's a \u201clie\u201d that the cuts won't hurt Americans. \u201cBehind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting health care for millions of Americans,\" said the New York senator.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package's impacts on the government balance sheets, particular rising annual deficits. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed.",
      "Trump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.",
      "The president laid into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning deficit hawk who has made a career of arguing against government spending. Paul wants the package's $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling out of the bill.",
      "\u201cRand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!).\u201d Trump posted.",
      "Paul seemed unfazed. \u201cI like the president, supported the president,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t in good conscience give up every principle that I stand for and every principle that I was elected upon.\u201d",
      "The July 4th deadline is not only aspirational for the president, it's all but mandatory for his Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congress that the nation will run out of money to pay its bills if the debt ceiling, now at $36 trillion, is not lifted by mid-July or early August to allow more borrowing. Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership.",
      "Thune acknowledged Tuesday that lifting the debt ceiling is not up for debate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got to be done,\u201d the South Dakota senator said.",
      "The road ahead is also a test for Thune who, like Johnson, is a newer leader in Congress and among the many Republicans adjusting their own priorities with Trump's return to the White House.",
      "While Johnson has warned against massive changes to the package, Thune faces demands from his senators for adjustments.",
      "To make most of the tax cuts permanent \u2014 particularly the business tax breaks that are the Senate priorities \u2014 senators may shave some of Trump's proposed new tax breaks on automobile loans or overtime pay, which are policies less prized by some senators.",
      "There are also discussions about altering the $40,000 cap that the House proposed for state and local deductions, known as SALT, which are important to lawmakers in high-tax New York, California and other states, but less so among GOP senators.",
      "\u201cWe're having all those discussions,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., another key voice in the debate.",
      "Hawley is a among a group of senators, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have raised concerns about the Medicaid changes that could boot people from health insurance.",
      "A potential copay of up to $35 for Medicaid services that was part of the House package, as well as a termination of a provider tax that many states rely on to help fund rural hospitals, have also raised concerns.",
      "\u201cThe best way to not be accused of cutting Medicaid is to not cut Medicaid,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "Collins said she is reviewing the details.",
      "There's also a House provision that would allow the auction of spectrum bandwidth that some senators oppose.",

      "A Spanish government minister tells The Associated Press that Spain has sent a message with its recent crackdown on Airbnb",
      "MADRID -- MADRID (AP) \u2014 Spain 's government wanted to send a message last month with its crackdown on Airbnb: that the Spanish economy and its housing market are not a \u201cfree for all\" that value profits over the rule of law, a minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "The government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules by failing to list license numbers, listing the wrong license number or not specifying the apartment's owner. Airbnb is appealing the move.",
      "Spain is one of the world\u2019s most visited countries. Last year, the Southern European nation of 49 million received a record 94 million international visitors.",
      "But a housing affordability problem that is particularly acute in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona has led to growing antagonism against short-term holiday rentals. Airbnb is perhaps the best-known and most visible actor.",
      "The Spanish government says the two are related: the rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, and rising rents and housing costs.",
      "\u201cObviously there is a correlation between these two facts,\u201d Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s not a linear relation, it\u2019s not the only factor affecting it, there are many others, but it is obviously one of the elements that is contributing.\u201d",
      "A recent Bank of Spain report said the country has a shortfall of 450,000 homes. In the tourist hot spots of the Canary and Balearic Islands, half the housing stock is tourist accommodations or properties owned by nonresidents, the report said.",
      "\u201cTourism is for sure a vital part of the Spanish economy. It\u2019s a strategic and very important sector. But as in every other economic activity, it must be conducted in a sustainable way,\" Bustinduy said. \u201cIt cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people. Their right to housing, but also their right to well-being.\u201d",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Homemade signs including one that read \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d at a recent march in Madrid point to the growing anger.",
      "\u201cA balance must be found between the constitutional rights of the Spanish people and economic activities in general,\" Bustinduy said.",
      "Regional governments in Spain are also tackling the issue. Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "Airbnb said that while its appeal goes through the courts, no holiday rentals would be immediately taken down from the site.",
      "In response to Spain's order, Airbnb has said the platform connects property owners with renters but it doesn't have oversight obligations, even though it requires hosts to show that they are compliant with local laws.",
      "Bustinduy said Spain's recent action reflects a desire in Spain, but also elsewhere, to hold tech companies like Airbnb to account.",
      "\u201cThere is a battle going on about accountability and about responsibility,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cThe digital nature of these extraordinarily powerful multinational corporations must not be an excuse to fail to comply with democratically established regulations.\u201d",
      "Bustinduy, who belongs to the governing coalition's left-wing Sumar party, dismissed the idea that the Spanish government's action toward Airbnb could discourage some tourists from visiting.",
      "\u201cIt will encourage longer stays, it will encourage responsible tourism and it will preserve everything that we have in this wonderful country which is the reason why so many people want to come here,\" he said.",
      "The minister also took a shot at low-cost airlines. Spain has pushed against allowing such airlines to charge passengers for hand baggage. Last year, it fined five budget airlines, including RyanAir and easyJet, a total of $179 million for charging for hand luggage.",
      "\u201cThe principle behind these actions is always the same: preserving consumer rights,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cPowerful corporations, no matter how large, have to adapt their business models to existing regulations.\u201d",

      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators, which kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of vital cash to fund improvements.",

      "The iconic Goodyear airships are taking a \u201cvictory lap\u201d over the skies of an Ohio city this week",
      "The iconic Goodyear airships are taking a victory lap over the skies of an Ohio city this week.",
      "The Akron-based tire company is celebrating the 100th anniversary of \u201cPilgrim,\u201d its first blimp to take flight just outside of the city on June 3, 1925.",
      "Goodyear began experimenting with vessels that would be lighter than aircraft in the early 1900s, and the dirigibles have since become a lasting and iconic symbol of the corporate brand. For some, it evokes nostalgia, while for others it offers a glimpse into a larger-than-life part of advertisement history.",
      "Here is a by-the-numbers look at Goodyear airships over time:",
      "Goodyear establishes an Aeronautics Department to build lighter-than-air aircrafts, and by 1912 the company had built its first balloon.",
      "In 1930, the \u201cDefender\u201d blimp became the first airship in the world to carry a lit neon sign so the company\u2019s name could be seen after dark.",
      "Goodyear began making airships for the U.S. Navy in 1917, and its first blimp \u2014 the first commercial non-rigid airship flown using helium \u2014 launched years later, becoming a marketing tool.",
      "From 1942 to 1944, the company built more than 150 airships for the Navy to serve in World War II, flying patrol over warships on the seas with zero reported loss of ships when a blimp was on watch.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform.",
      "Since that time, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology; safety innovations; high-definition cameras; aerial views captured with specialized systems that compensate for movement during filming, resulting in stable and smooth footage footage; and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "There currently are four Goodyear Blimps \u2014 the three in the U.S. and one in Friedrichshafen, Germany.",
      "Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps are semi-rigid dirigibles, meaning they have an internal frame as compared to previous eras of blimps that could be fully deflated. In 2014, Goodyear transitioned to the New Technology semi-rigid airship platform designed to allow for improved maneuverability and speed.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp is 246 feet long (75 meters), which would cover about 80% of a football field. It is 58 feet (18 meters) high and holds three Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of helium.",
      "Goodyear gets helium for its blimps from multiple sources. Because helium is a finite resource, the company purifies its helium every six to eight weeks to extend its life.",
      "The blimp travels more than 100 days per year, with trips ranging anywhere from three days to three weeks. A crew of nearly 20 people travel with the airship whenever it is touring. Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps fly between 1,000 and 1,500 feet (305 meters and 457 meters) in the air and travel at speeds up to 73 miles per hour (117 kilometers per hour).",
      "There currently are fewer blimp pilots in the world than astronauts, according to Goodyear, which has 10 full-time pilots. To serve in that job, you must have a commercial pilot license followed by approximately 250 hours of training to earn an additional lighter-than-air airship rating from the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, but it was rapper Ice Cube who raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",

      "Gabrielle Cuccia calls herself a \u201cMAGA girl\u201d who made no secret of her support for President Donald Trump, even as she got a job covering the Pentagon for the One America News Network",
      "Assigned to cover the Pentagon for the conservative outlet One America News Network, Gabrielle Cuccia didn't pretend to be an unbiased reporter. She describes herself as \u201ca MAGA girl\u201d who is unapologetically defiant in her support of President Donald Trump.",
      "Yet days after publicly criticizing a Trump appointee, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Cuccia found herself out of a job.",
      "In taking to Substack last week to express a personal opinion about a figure she covers, Cuccia did something that would be frowned upon in many legacy newsrooms. The message that she was sent, however, is most likely to resound in places where opinion is fine \u2014 but only a certain variety.",
      "Cuccia's lengthy Substack post, \u201cThe Secretary of Defense-ive,\u201d was posted three days after Hegseth issued new rules that banned reporters from accessing large areas of the Pentagon without being watched by his minders.",
      "She criticized him for limiting freedom of movement in the name of national security.",
      "\u201cThe Pentagon wants to paint a picture that journalists are freely roaming classified spaces, sneaking into (secure areas), and leaking top-secret information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd that is simply not true. There are security cameras everywhere, protocols in place and quite frankly, it would be painfully obvious if a reporter was in a space they didn't belong.\u201d",
      "Cuccia said the real leaks from the Pentagon have come from Hegseth's own team and other senior officials. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, was embarrassed in March when The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief was mistakenly included in a Signal chat in which the defense secretary discussed upcoming military strikes.",
      "She criticized Hegseth for not yet holding a media briefing at the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cThe Commander-in-Chief welcomes the hard questions ... and yes, even the dumb ones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy won't the Secretary of Defense do the same?\u201d",
      "Three days after her Memorial Day Substack post, Cuccia said her Pentagon access badge was revoked. \u201cBy Friday,\" she said, \u201cI was out of a job.\u201d",
      "The Defense Department did not pull Cuccia's credentials, according to a Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Cuccia said OAN told her the Substack piece had been \u201cput on their radar,\u201d but she wouldn't say by who. She wouldn't speak further about what her employer told her, and OAN president Charles Herring told The Associated Press that it does not discuss personnel issues.",
      "\u201cWhen a reporter asks inconvenient questions about government overreach, the response should be accountability \u2014 not silence, and certainly not separation,\u201d Cuccia said.",
      "Traditionally, the legacy media does not want its journalists expressing opinions about people they cover, since it calls into doubt their ability to report without bias. But exceptions are often made in cases where media access is at issue, said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "The New York Times, for example, institutionally called upon Joe Biden to meet more often with journalists when he was president. The Pentagon Press Association said Hegseth\u2019s restrictions were a direct assault on the freedom of the press.",
      "One America News Network makes no secret of its allegiance to Trump. When Matt Gaetz's nomination as Trump's attorney general fell apart following the election, OAN quickly signed him up as a contributor. OAN faced lawsuits \u2014 and negotiated settlements \u2014 for its promotion of Trump's false theories that he did not lose the 2020 election.",
      "When Hegseth earlier this year evicted several news organizations from their Pentagon workspaces and gave more room to friendly outlets, Cuccia was assigned space formerly held by NBC News. Before Hegseth aide Sean Parnell's only media briefing, Cuccia said Hegseth's team reached out to her in advance to find out what questions she wanted to ask, something that would never be done for most media outlets.",
      "If OAN is responsible for removing Cuccia, it's a \u201ctake no quarter position,\u201d Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere is no room, if you're on the team, to say anything that is negative.\u201d",
      "He said he'd be interested to see if any representatives from pro-Trump media outlets defend her. \u201cAre they silent, or do they rally to her in any way?\u201d he asked. Trump, in the past, has frequently criticized Fox News Channel for saying anything on the air that he deemed negative.",
      "Part of Cuccia's Substack post sounded almost prescient about what might happen to her, when she reminisced about the energy of the early Make America Great Again movement. Questioning government then, she noted, was a point of pride.",
      "\u201cSomewhere along the way, we as a collective decided \u2014 if anyone ever questioned a policy or person within the MAGA movement \u2014 that they weren't MAGA enough,\" she wrote. \"That they were deep state, that they couldn't be trusted, that they didn't love America as much as we do and that ... to put it bluntly, they sucked.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Liberal opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung has been elected president of South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung, who rose from childhood poverty to become South Korea\u2019s leading liberal politician vowing to fight inequality and corruption, will become the country's next president on Wednesday after an election that closed one of the most turbulent chapters in the young democracy.",
      "Lee, 60, the candidate of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, is taking office for a full, single five-year term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who was felled over his stunning yet brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "It was unclear whether Lee\u2019s election would cause any major, immediate shift in South Korea\u2019s foreign policy. Lee, previously accused by critics of tilting toward China and North Korea and away from the U.S. and Japan, has repeatedly stressed South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of its foreign policy.",
      "The toughest external challenges awaiting Lee are U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy and North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program. But experts earlier said whoever becomes president can't do much to secure major progress in South Korea\u2019s favor on those issues.",
      "As of 3:45 a.m. Wednesday, with over 99% of the votes counted, Lee obtained 49.3% of the votes cast in Tuesday's early election, while main conservative contender Kim Moon Soo trailed with 41.3% \u2014 a gap that was impossible to overcome mathematically.",
      "Preelection surveys have long suggested Lee appeared headed for an easy win, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle.",
      "Even before Lee\u2019s win was formally declared, Kim conceded, telling journalists that he \u201chumbly accepts the people\u2019s choice,\u201d and congratulated Lee.",
      "Earlier, Lee appeared before thousands of cheering supporters on Seoul's streets. He didn't formally claim victory, but reiterated his major policy goals, such as revitalizing the economy, promoting peace with North Korea and easing a domestic divide.",
      "\u201cLet us move forward with hope and make a fresh start from this moment on,\u201d he said. \u201cThough we may have clashed for some time, even those who did not support us are still our fellow citizens of the Republic of Korea.\u201d",
      "Lee, who served as governor of Gyeonggi province and mayor of Seongnam city, has been a highly divisive figure in politics for years.",
      "As a former child laborer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country\u2019s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country\u2019s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.",
      "His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on political division and backpedals on promises too easily.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has promised to develop the alliance with the U.S. and solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that isn't much different from the position held by South Korea\u2019s conservatives.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to now see if the pressures of office will cause Lee Jae-myung to govern from the center \u2014 at least when it comes to matters of national security and the alliance with the United States,\u201d said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Lee said that he would pursue better ties with North Korea, but acknowledged that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon. This signals Lee won't likely initiate any drastic steps meant to improve relations with North Korea.",
      "Experts say there aren\u2019t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence, as well as North Korea\u2019s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and other candidates avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn\u2019t much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea. Paik said Lee also doesn\u2019t share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-22 term.",
      "There are still hopes that diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea could resume, with Trump repeatedly expressing his intent to reach out to Kim Jong Un. Lee has said that he would support Trump's outreach.",
      "\u201cSouth Korea and the United States may be better aligned on engaging North Korea under the current constellation of leadership in both countries,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe two sides should begin consultations soon to ensure they\u2019re aligned on their goals.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s government still could become engaged in \u201ca little bit of friction\u201d with the Trump administration, said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University.",
      "Chung predicted Lee still won\u2019t be able to pursue overly drastic steps on foreign policy and security, given the country\u2019s foreign exchange and financial markets are vulnerable to such changes.",
      "Lee has preached patience over Trump\u2019s tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington.",
      "On Monday, South Korean trade officials held an emergency meeting to discuss a response to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will raise tariffs on steel and aluminum products to 50% beginning Wednesday. South Korea\u2019s central bank last week sharply lowered its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, citing the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by the political turmoil of past months.",
      "The election serves as another defining moment in the country\u2019s resilient democracy, but observers worry a worsened domestic divide could pose a big political burden on the new president.",

      "U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year from 2.8% last year as President Donald Trump\u2019s erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, drive up costs and leave businesses and consumers paralyzed by uncertainty.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy \u2014 the world's largest \u2014 will slow further to just 1.5% in 2026. Trump\u2019s policies have raised average U.S. tariff rates from around 2.5% when he returned to the White House to 15.4%, highest since 1938, according to the OECD. Tariffs raise costs for consumers and American manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials and components.",
      "World economic growth will slow to just 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. It marks a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",
      "The world economy has proven remarkably resilient in recent years, continuing to expand steadily \u2014 though unspectacularly \u2014 in the face of global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But global trade and the economic outlook have been clouded by Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, the unpredictable way he's rolled them out and the threat of retaliation from other countries.",
      "Reversing decades of U.S. policy in favor of freer world trade, Trump has levied 10% taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country on earth along with specific duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He's also threatened more import taxes, including a doubling of his tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "Adding to the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s trade wars: A federal court in New York last week blocked most of Trump\u2019s tariffs, ruling that he\u2019d overstepped his authority in imposing them. Then an appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the taxes while appeals worked their way through the U.S. courts.",
      "China \u2014 the world's second-biggest economy \u2014 is forecast to see growth decelerate from 5% last year to 4.7% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Chinese exporters will be hurt by Trump's tariffs, hobbling an economy already weakened by the collapse of the nation's real estate market. Some of the damage will be offset by help from the government: Beijing last month outlined plans to cut interest rates and encourage bank lending as well as allocating more money for factory upgrades and elder care, among other things.",
      "The 20 countries that share the euro currency will collectively see economic growth pick up from 0.8% last year to 1% in 2025 and 1.2% next year, the OECD said, helped by interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.",
      "The Paris-based OECD, comprising 38 member countries, works to promote international trade and prosperity and issues periodic reports and analyses.",

      "A year ago, Boisson was supposed to make her Grand Slam debut in Paris, but she tore a knee ligament and couldn't compete.

      "She's doing it with a game made for clay, anchored by heavy groundstrokes and buoyed by a rowdy, partisan crowd that rattled the 18-year-old Andreeva \u2014 she was warned for ball abuse for smacking one toward the upper deck after one bad volley \u2014 and was just as loud when Boisson upset No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the fourth round.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to describe,\u201d Boisson said, \u201cwhat it feels like to have that kind of support.\u201d",
      "Over and over again, the chair umpire tried to tell the 15,000 or so spectators to be quiet as their thunderous applause and shouts of Boisson's first name reverberated off the inside of the closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier. They didn't heed those requests. They jeered and whistled when Andreeva complained about noise between her first and second serves or argued line calls.",
      "And Boisson hung in there even while facing a set point in the first while down 5-3.",
      "When the match ended, Boisson collapsed to her back, chest heaving and hands on her face. When she rose, there were flecks of rust-colored clay all over, including her forehead.",
      "No matter what happens the rest of the way, Boisson certainly has left her mark on the 2025 French Open.",
      "The men's quarterfinals later in the day were No. 1 Jannik Sinner against unseeded Alexander Bublik, and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic against No. 3 Alexander Zverev.",
      "The two women's semifinals are the only singles matches on the Day 12 schedule, with three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek facing No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in just their second matchup at a Grand Slam tournament, and Gauff meeting Boisson, The men's semifinals are Friday.",

      "The three-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman realizes Green Bay's pass rush can't afford a repeat of its inconsistent 2024 performance.",
      "\u201cIt was on and off,\u201d the three-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman said during organized team activities this week. \u201cHonestly, not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough to win a championship, so we\u2019ve got to be better.\u201d",
      "That's why Green Bay's pass rushers have been conducting regular offseason film sessions at Clark's home.",
      "Rashan Gary, a Pro Bowl defensive lineman entering his seventh season in Green Bay, says this marks the first time they\u2019ve had these types of weekend film studies at somebody\u2019s house this early in the year.",
      "\u201cKC\u2019s is the spot,\u201d Gary said. \u201cKC\u2019s is the film study house. Everybody pulls up (to) KC. We might have pizza, wings, things like that, but we\u2019re getting together and we\u2019re locking in on details.\u201d",
      "Green Bay collected 45 sacks last season to tie for eighth place among all NFL teams, but more than half of those sacks came in just four games. The Packers had eight sacks against Tennessee, seven against Seattle, five against Miami and four against Houston.",
      "In seven of their 17 games, the Packers had no more than one sack. They sacked Jalen Hurts twice in their 22-10 wild-card playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "Green Bay ranked 16th in pressure rate, which calculates the number of hurries, knockdowns and sacks for each team divided by an opponent\u2019s dropback attempts.",
      "The Packers must find creative ways to improve because they didn\u2019t add proven pass rushers in the offseason. Their main free-agent move involving a player on the front seven was allowing T.J. Slaton to sign with the Cincinnati Bengals.",
      "Green Bay did add three defensive linemen in the final day of the draft by selecting Texas\u2019 Barryn Sorrell in the fourth round, Oklahoma State\u2019s Collin Oliver in the fifth and Georgia\u2019s Warren Brinson in the sixth.",
      "Perhaps their biggest offseason move to address the pass rush was the hiring of defensive line coach DeMarcus Covington to replace the fired Jason Rebrovich, who now is an assistant defensive line coach for the Buffalo Bills. Covington spent the last eight seasons in New England and was the Patriots\u2019 defensive coordinator in 2024.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just a leader of men,\u201d defensive lineman Lukas Van Ness said. \u201cWe\u2019ve started doing handshakes at the beginning of every meeting, just building that camaraderie. I think when you want to play for the guy next to you on the field, it\u2019s a brotherhood. Together when we\u2019re one, that\u2019s when we\u2019re the best.\u201d",
      "The Packers believe they can get more production from their returning players.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a number of young players that are coming into their own and should play their best football in front of them,\u201d general manager Brian Gutekunst said after the draft.",
      "A couple of them were playing through injuries last year.",
      "Clark injured his right foot during the Packers\u2019 season-opening loss to the Eagles in Brazil \u2014 he complained about the Corinthians Arena turf after the game \u2014 and underwent surgery in the offseason. Clark went from having a career-high 7 \u00bd sacks in 2023 to a career-low one in 2024.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re taking every step and the toe is busting,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to deal with, but it is what it is. That\u2019s done. I got the surgery done, and yeah, we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d",
      "Van Ness, the 13th overall pick in the 2023 draft, said he wore a cast on his broken right thumb until about the 10th or 11th week of the 2024 season. Van Ness recorded three sacks last season, none after Thanksgiving.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if any of you guys have ever broken a thumb or hand or anything, you kind of get a little bit of a mental block, and it\u2019s kind of taken me a little bit of time to gain some confidence again in utilizing my hand to its fullest extent,\u201d Van Ness said.",
      "The Packers expect to be healthier this year. They also should be more comfortable now that they\u2019ve had time to adapt to second-year defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and his 4-3 scheme.",
      "They just need to be more dynamic on a week-in, week-out basis. They're hoping that improvement starts in Clark's home.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is just getting the bonding. Just building as a team,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need everybody, and need everybody to be playing at a high level to start the season, and so forth. So (we\u2019re) just make sure we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders.\u201d",

      "It was a contest filled with plenty of mistakes by both Americans, who each has claimed one major championship. They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.",
      "The No. 2-seeded Gauff won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open. She'll play Thursday for a berth in another Grand Slam final, facing either No. 6 Mirra Andreeva or 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Lo\u00efs Boisson.",
      "\u201cI have a lot more work left to do,\u201d said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, \u201cbut I'm going to savor this one today.\u201d",
      "She started particularly poorly against Keys, trailing 4-1 and being a point from a 5-1 deficit. Gauff bowed her head or sighed after some miscues. Then, suddenly, she got going, using her speed and instincts to stretch points until Keys \u2014 the Australian Open champion in January \u2014 missed.",
      "That helped Gauff get within a point of taking that set. But the 21-year-old based in Florida double-faulted three times in the tiebreaker, and soon was headed to the locker room to regroup.",

      "Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys that against plenty of other players would end the point. And often enough, it worked well, leading to a miss by Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.",
      "\u201cWith her ability to cover the court,\u201d Keys said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to win the point multiple times before it\u2019s actually over.\u201d",

      "The government touches every aspect of life in China. That top-down control has helped China become the largest manufacturer of everything from electronics to shoes to steel.",
      "It has tried to run soccer, but that rigid governance hasn't worked.",
      "\u201cWhat soccer reflects is the social and political problems of China,\" Zhang Feng, a Chinese journalist and commentator, tells The Associated Press. \"It\u2019s not a free society. It doesn't have the team-level trust that allows players to pass the ball to each other without worrying.\u201d",
      "Zhang argues that politics has stalled soccer's growth. And there's added pressure since Xi's a big fan and has promised to resuscitate the game at home. Soccer is a world language with its \u201cown grammar,\u201d says Zhang, and China doesn't speak it.",
      "\u201cIn China, the more emphasis the leader places on soccer, the more nervous the society gets, the more power the bureaucrats get, and the more corrupt they become,\" Zhang adds.",
      "After China defeated Thailand 2-1 in 2023, Xi joked with Srettha Thavisin, the Thai prime minister at the time. \"I feel luck was a big part of it,\u201d Xi said.",
      "The consensus is clear. China has too few quality players at the grass roots, too much political interference from the Communist Party, and there's too much corruption in the local game.",
      "Wang Xiaolei, another prominent Chinese commentator, suggests that soccer clashes with China's top-down governance and the emphasis on rote learning.",
      "\u201cWhat are we best at? Dogma,\" Wang wrote in a blog last year. \u201cBut football cannot be dogmatic. What are we worst at? Inspiring ingenuity, and cultivating passion.\u201d",
      "The latest chapter in China's abysmal men's soccer history was a 7-0 loss last year to geopolitical rival Japan.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this defeat can happen and people aren\u2019t that surprised \u2014 despite the historical animosity \u2014 just illustrates the problems facing football in China,\" says Cameron Wilson, a Scot who has worked in China for 20 years and written extensively about the game there.",
      "China has qualified for only one men's World Cup. That was 2002 when it went scoreless and lost all three matches. Soccer's governing body FIFA places China at No. 94 in its rankings \u2014 behind war-torn Syria and ahead of No. 95 Benin.",
      "For perspective: Iceland is the smallest country to reach the World Cup. Its latest population estimate is almost 400,000.",
      "The website Soccerway tracks global football and doesn't show a single Chinese player in a top European league. The national team's best player is forward Wu Lei, who played for three seasons in Spain's La Liga for Espanyol. The club's majority owner in Chinese.",
      "The 2026 World Cup will have a field of 48 teams, a big increase on the 32 in 2022, yet China still might not make it.",
      "China will be eliminated from qualification if it loses to Indonesia. Even if it wins, China must also beat Bahrain on June 10 to have any hope of advancing to Asia's next qualifying stage.",
      "Englishman Rowan Simons has spent almost 40 years in China and gained fame doing television commentary in Chinese on English Premier League matches. He also wrote the 2008 book \u201cBamboo Goalposts.\u201d",
      "China is benefiting from reforms over the last decade that placed soccer in schools. But Simons argues that soccer culture grows from volunteers, civil society and club organizations, none of which can flourish in China since they are possible challengers to the rule of the Communist Party.",
      "\u201cIn China at the age of 12 or 13, when kids go to middle school, it\u2019s known as the cliff,\u201d he says. \"Parents may allow their kids to play sports when they\u2019re younger, but as soon as it comes to middle school the academic pressure is on \u2014 things like sport go by the wayside.\u201d",
      "To be fair, the Chinese women's team has done better than the men. China finished runner-up in the 1999 Women's World Cup but has faded as European teams have surged with built-in expertise from the men's game. Spain won the 2023 Women's World Cup. China was knocked out early, battered 6-1 by England in group play.",
      "China has been successful targeting Olympic sports, some of which are relatively obscure and rely on repetitive training more than creativity. Olympic team sports like soccer offer only one medal. So, like many countries, China focuses on sports with multiple medals. In China's case it's diving, table tennis and weightlifting.",
      "\u201cFor young people, there's a single value \u2014 testing well,\u201d says Zhang, the commentator and journalist. \"China would be OK if playing soccer were only about bouncing the ball 1,000 times.\"",
      "Li Tie, the national team coach for about two years beginning in January 2020, was last year sentenced to 20 years in prison for bribery and match fixing. Other top administrators have also been accused of corruption.",
      "The graft also extended to the domestic Super League. Clubs spent millions \u2014 maybe billions \u2014 on foreign talents backed by many state-owned businesses and, before the collapse of the housing boom, real-estate developers.",
      "The poster child was Guangzhou Evergrande. The eight-time Super League champions, once coached by Italian Marcello Lippi, was expelled from the league and disbanded earlier this year, unable to pay off its debts.",
      "Zhang says businessmen invested in professional soccer teams as a \u201cpolitical tribute\" and cited Hui Ka-yan. The embattled real estate developer financed the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club and used soccer to win favor from politicians.",
      "Property giant Evergrande has amassed debts reported at $300 billion, reflective of China\u2019s battered property segment and the general health of the economy.",

      "While both teams made major improvements from last season's respective rosters in the conference finals and conference semifinals, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, who led Dallas on its only title run in 2010-11 knows just how difficult the challenge can be, especially against Oklahoma City.",
      "\u201cTheir depth of great defenders is staggering,\u201d he said before listing names. \u201c Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) is a great scorer, but he's also a great competitor. You've got Jalen Williams, you've got (Lu) Dort, you've got (Alex) Caruso, and a bunch of other guys. People talk about (Aaron) Wiggins, Cason Wallace and all these guys are great competitors. And then they've got the rim protection to go along with it.\u201d",
      "That combination helped the Thunder win a league-high 68 regular-season games while earning the top seed in the Western Conference for the second straight year.",
      "Apparently, it was just a warmup. During the franchise's first Finals run since 2012, the Thunder's scoring defense has been even stingier \u2014 allowing just 106.3 points per game compared with 107.6 over the first 82 games \u2014 while yielding fewer than 100 points in half of their 12 postseason wins.",
      "While Indiana has not matched those numbers, they eliminated three teams \u2014 New York, Cleveland and Milwaukee \u2014 that each averaged more than 115 points during the regular season. In 16 playoff games, they held those three teams below their averages 11 times.",
      "Naturally, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault has been taking notes.",
      "\u201cIf you look at this playoff run, you\u2019ll see how challenging they are for their opponents, and the way they defend contributes to their team identity. It\u2019s not just offense,\" he said. \u201cTheir defensive philosophy is very much aligned with their offensive philosophy, so it creates a certain air to the game when you play against them. It is difficult to play against, as you can see from the way that they\u2019ve really run through the Eastern Conference to get here.\u201d",
      "Their rosters were constructed in similar fashions, too.",
      "Both teams are young, rely on deep benches to wear down opponents late and feast on turnovers. The Thunder average a postseason best 21.3 points per game off turnovers while the Pacers are second at 18.5.",
      "But with so much focus on the high-scoring, up-tempo offenses, it's easy to overlook their defenses or worse \u2014 see it as a glaring weakness.",
      "A year ago, Indiana gave up 120.2 points per game in the regular season. This year that number dropped to 115.1, and in the postseason it's down to 113.3.",
      "What changed?",
      "Indiana's top three defenders \u2014 Aaron Nesmith, Andrew Nembhard and Myles Turner \u2014 are all relatively healthy now.",
      "Nesmith missed 2 1/2 months with a sprained left ankle before returning in January and working his way back into game shape. He sprained his right ankle in Game 3 of the conference finals against the New York Knicks but played in each of the final three games.",
      "Nembhard also missed nearly a month early this season with tendinitis in his left knee, and Turner, Indiana's rim protector, has overcome an assortment of nagging injuries.",
      "But Indiana also changed its forcus after getting swept by Boston in 2024.",
      "\u201cLast year, all that was being said was we couldn't win because we didn't guard anybody and all we do is try to outscore people,\u201d two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cWe've taken such a big step on the defensive end as a group, and I think the step we made on that end of the floor is why we're here. We've got our work cut out for us (in this series).\u201d",
      "Neither Carlisle nor Daigneault would disclose their defensive assignments entering Game 1 though there's a good chance Nembhard and Nesmith will somehow find themselves pitted against Gilgeous-Alexander, the league MVP, and Williams.",
      "On the flip side, Oklahoma City may deploy its two all-NBA defenders, Williams and Dort, against the combination of Haliburton and Nembhard.",
      "But regardless of the assignments, this is a matchup of wills most believe will determine the next NBA champion.",
      "\u201cAll tests are fun, and we get to do it on the biggest stage any of us have ever played on,\" Williams said. \"So it\u2019ll be a very fun challenge. Like I said, that\u2019s a really good team. Obviously, they\u2019re in the finals for a reason. Nobody just waltzes into the finals. So it\u2019ll be our ultimate test.\u201d",

      "The Astros right-hander pitched six scoreless innings to get his first win since Sept. 21, 2022, as Houston beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-0. McCullers missed the 2023 and 2024 seasons because of injuries and had not won in five starts this year since being activated from the injured list on May 4.",

      "\u201cIt took a while, but we got there,\u201d McCullers said of getting the win. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m kind of back in the mix with the guys, and I\u2019m able to give them legitimate opportunities to win.\u201d",
      "McCullers was also happy to have a difficult off-field situation behind him.",
      "A drunken bettor who made online death threats aimed at McCullers\u2019 family lives overseas and told Houston police he was sorry for what he had done, a department spokesperson said Monday.",
      "McCullers received the threats  on social media directed at his children after a poor start against the Cincinnati Reds on May 10 in which he allowed seven runs while recording only one out.",
      "The Astros said Houston police and MLB security were notified. McCullers and his wife Kara have two young daughters. Astros owner Jim Crane hired 24-hour security for them.",
      "Police public information officer Erika Ramirez said the man who made the threats was identified during an investigation. Because no charges have been filed, police are not disclosing his identity or where he lives.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep on about it, but a lot of thanks go to the Astros, the Astros security, Jim Crane, MLB security, my teammates, the HPD,\u201d McCullers said. \u201cHaving resolution is nice. Not being close to Houston is nice. The fans are super supportive, too, and I appreciate that. It\u2019s good that it\u2019s behind us and our family feels safe again.\u201d",
      "The man told police that he would like to apologize to McCullers for the threats. McCullers said he would accept.",
      "\u201cAs a follower of Christ and called to love our neighbor and forgive, I would be open to that,\u201d he said.",

      "Manny Pacquiao says he is done with politics, and he\u2019s back in boxing to stay",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Manny Pacquiao says he is done with politics, and he's back in boxing to stay.",
      "Pacquiao's ring return at 46 years old is not just for one farewell bout, either: The former eight-division world champion intends to fight on indefinitely.",
      "\u201cRight now, the book of politics is closed,\u201d Pacquiao told The Associated Press on Tuesday in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s not even in my mind. I\u2019m focusing on my career as a boxer again.\u201d",
      "The comeback starts July 19, when Pacquiao returns from a four-year layoff and attempts to break his own record by becoming the oldest welterweight champion in boxing history. The former senator and presidential candidate in his native Philippines will take on WBC champ Mario Barrios in Las Vegas.",
      "As Pacquiao's fame and fortune grew in the previous decade, he added a second career as a politician to his already busy life. He was a senator from 2016 until 2022, when he finished third in the Philippines' presidential election.",
      "He ran to reclaim a seat in the Senate this year, but finished 18th in the midterm elections. After that defeat last month, Pacquiao quickly announced plans to return to the ring \u2014 and now that he's back in Los Angeles training with Freddie Roach, Pacquiao made it clear that he wishes he never left boxing.",
      "\u201cI can still do my job in boxing,\u201d Pacquiao said. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet. The fire, the determination, the eagerness to train and work hard, it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d",
      "Pacquiao hasn't fought since losing a decision to Yordenis Ug\u00e1s in August 2021, but he says he dearly missed the sport from the moment he stepped away. He beams when he speaks about honing his craft with Roach, the fun of working out each day with his extensive team \u2014 and even the promotional publicity tasks that go along with being one of the most famous athletes on the planet.",
      "\u201cThat moment when I announced I was hanging up my gloves four years ago, I was so sad,\" Pacquiao said. \"I couldn\u2019t avoid the tears coming out of my eyes. I really missed boxing. For however many months, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not a boxer anymore?\u2019\u201d",
      "He filled the time away with nonstop sports endeavors at his Philippines estate, where he has a full boxing gym, a covered basketball court, a tennis court and facilities for badminton, pickleball and tennis. He also ran in his huge backyard, staying in shape on the one-kilometer expanse.",
      "Pacquiao claims his famed hand speed and athleticism are still there, and he feels refreshed after four years of not getting hit. But Pacquiao also realizes his fans could be worried about a comeback because of his unimpressive effort against Ug\u00e1s, who soundly outboxed him four years ago.",
      "Pacquiao says he was undone in 2021 by numerous distractions \u2014 his imminent presidential run, a hefty lawsuit filed against him by a management company, and even an ill-advised massage shortly before the bout that left him painfully sore on fight night.",
      "\u201cI was so bothered,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a lot of things that aren't good for me.\u201d",
      "Pacquiao will interrupt his training this week only for a celebration of his career: He will be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame this weekend in upstate New York, and then he\u2019ll return to Roach\u2019s Wild Card Gym.",
      "Pacquiao\u2019s return bout will be seen worldwide on Amazon Prime pay-per-view, and he seems likely to capture an audience of fans who remember his incredible prime. Pacquiao had his first professional fight in January 1995, four months before Barrios was born.",
      "\u201cHe's a hard guy to dislike,\u201d Barrios said. \u201cA legend is going to be across from me. I have all the respect for him outside the ring, but inside the ring, he's just another man trying to take what's mine.\u201d",
      "Pacquiao was jovial and excited throughout the news conference at a theater in downtown Los Angeles, radiating a youthful vigor while promoting a card stacked with fighters from another generation. He seems confident he can carry that energy into the ring against Barrios.",
      "But Pacquiao also has firsthand experience of the ugliness that can consume fighters who hang on a bit too long. After all, he moved up two weight classes and ended the decorated career of Oscar De La Hoya in December 2008, stopping the Golden Boy after eight one-sided rounds.",
      "Pacquiao says his fans shouldn't worry. He's back where he belongs.",
      "\u201cI returned because I missed boxing,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I can entertain you guys.\u201d",

      "But months later, the switch-hitter tore a knee ligament playing winter ball in the Dominican Republic and missed the 2024 season while recovering from multiple operations.",

      "When the threat of wildfires has forced power to be cut in the tourist town of Calistoga, California, on the edge of Napa Valley, it\u2019s meant firing up a bank of noisy, polluting diesel generators",
      "CALISTOGA, Calif. -- For residents of this quaint tourist town on the northern edge of Napa Valley, the threat of wildfire is seldom out of mind. The hillside bears burn scars from a 2020 fire that forced all of Calistoga to evacuate, and the 2017 Tubbs fire that killed 22 people in wine country started just a few miles from downtown.",
      "When fire danger required shutting off transmission lines that might spark a blaze, the town relied on a bank of generators in a popular recreation area that belched choking diesel exhaust and rumbled so loudly it drove people away.",
      "But now Calistoga is shifting to a first-of-its-kind system that combines two clean-energy technologies \u2014 hydrogen fuel cells and batteries \u2014 for enough juice to power the city for about two days. Experts say the technology has potential beyond simply delivering clean backup power in emergencies; they say it's a steppingstone to supporting the electric grid any day of the year.",
      "As the system was undergoing its final tests in late May in an area that includes a dog park, ball fields, community garden and bike trail, residents said they were grateful to be guaranteed clean energy year-round. Lisa Gift, a resident who also serves on the city council, noted Calistoga is already grappling with climate change that is fueling more intense and frequent wildfires.",
      "\u201cContinuing to depend on fossil fuels was simply not sustainable,\u201d Gift said. \"That's what excited me about this. It\u2019s a clean and reliable energy solution that ensures the safety and resilience of our community.\u201d",
      "Energy Vault, an energy storage company based in California, built the new facility that was to come online in early June. Next year, it could be exporting power to the electric grid whenever needed once its application to fully connect is approved.",
      "The installation sits next to where Pacific Gas & Electric used to set up nine mobile generators every year from late spring through fall. Behind a chain-link fence stand six hydrogen fuel cells standing two stories tall made by Plug Power in New York. Water vapor wafted from one of the fuel cells being tested as The Associated Press got an exclusive tour of the site as it was in final testing.",
      "Shipping containers hold two pairs of Energy Vault's lithium-ion batteries. Nearby, a cinder block wall surrounds a massive, double-walled steel tank that holds 80,000 gallons (302,833 liters) of extremely cold liquid hydrogen that gets converted to gas to run the fuel cells.",
      "California utilities, especially PG&E, have had to pay large settlements over igniting wildfires. PG&E began cutting power at times to reduce fire risk in 2018, one of California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire years. It ships diesel generators to about a dozen towns to provide backup power during those periods.",
      "Calistoga, the largest with about 5,000 people, has had its power shut off 10 times. When generators ran, they spewed exhaust with harmful nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and soot. PG&E considered replacing Calistoga's diesel generators with a natural gas version that would pollute less, but opted instead for Energy Vault's fully clean solution, said Dave Canny, the utility\u2019s vice president for the North Coast Region.",
      "Energy Vault CEO Robert Piconi said other communities, military bases and data centers could all use something similar, but potential customers wanted to see it function first.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive proof point with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll have a lot of implications for how people think about alternative, sustainable solutions.\"",
      "The fuel cell maker, Plug Power, is planning for these types of products to be its main business in a decade. Energy Vault said it\u2019s buying clean hydrogen, produced with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, to run the fuel cells in Calistoga.",
      "\u201cThis solution is just beautiful,\" said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for green hydrogen projects to combat climate change. \"No noise, no emissions. And it\u2019s renewable. It\u2019s dumping diesel.\u201d",
      "Calistoga caters to tourists with a main thoroughfare that emphasizes local shops, restaurants, tasting rooms and art galleries over franchise stories. Residents pride themselves on a smalltown vibe, and say Calistoga isn't posh like much of the rest of Napa Valley.",
      "Some of those residents were concerned at first about the hydrogen, which is flammable and can be explosive. Fire Chief Jed Matcham said the \u201cvery, very large tank\u201d got his attention, too.",
      "He collaborated with Energy Vault on emergency planning and training, and said he's comfortable with the safety measures in place. Energy Vault's batteries also come with alarms, detectors and piping to extinguish a fire.",
      "The next time PG&E turns off the power to the area to prevent wildfires, it will tell Energy Vault when it\u2019s safe to electrify Calistoga. The batteries will get things back up and running, discharging the energy stored inside them to the local microgrid.",
      "Then the hydrogen fuel cells will take over to generate a steady level of power for a longer period. By working in tandem \u2014 the company likened it to the way a hybrid vehicle works \u2014 the batteries and fuel cells are expected to keep the lights on for about 48 hours or longer.",
      "Clive Richardson, who owns downtown's Calistoga Roastery and can typically be found behind the counter, drinking coffee and chatting with customers, said people in Calistoga get on edge when the winds kick up. And he knows what it's like to have to empty out his store when power goes out \u2014 a big hit for a small-business owner.",
      "A year-round clean solution for emergency power gives him a measure of comfort.",
      "\u201cThis will give us far more security than we had before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that it\u2019s come. Here we are, little ol\u2019 Calistoga, and we\u2019ve got the first-of-a-kind system that hopefully will be endorsed and go all over the world.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.",
      "The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.",
      "Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.",
      "While siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.",
      "\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.",
      "\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d",
      "In Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d",
      "Totenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"",
      "Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.",
      "\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d",

      "Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state's taxpayer funded zero-emission credit program expires.",
      "With the arrival of Meta, Clinton\u2019s clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes.",

      "Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers.

      "Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government\u2019s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production within the next 25 years, like the White House wants. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\u201d planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings.

      "Space weather forecasters say northern lights may be visible in parts of the northern United States following weekend solar storms",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. Monday night following weekend solar storms.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday, though it wasn't as strong as last year's record. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",
      "Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "The helicopter is currently used by Germany, the U.S. Hungary, Belgium, Ireland and other militaries with over 500 variants currently in operation, logging over 8 million flight hours, according to Cyprus Defense Minister Vassilis Palmas.",
      "\u201cThe new helicopter is a multi-role, digital instrument that is geared toward the demands of the 21st century,\u201d Palmas told a ceremony at Cyprus\u2019 main Paphos air base.",
      "Two more of the state-of-the-art aircraft will be delivered, while the contract with Airbus allows for the purchase of additional helicopters, said Airbus Senior Vice President for the H145 program Daniela Dudek.",
      "Dudek said the reliability of the 3.8 ton aircraft is affirmed by its 40 years of service but the integration of advanced avionics and weapons systems make it the \u201cmost military-capable aircraft in its category.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we achieved over years to quickly integrate existing technology on the market, defense technology, and it is unique what you have here. You\u2019re even more advanced than what we currently have in Germany,\u201d Dudek said.",
      "The helicopter's advanced avionics, which Airbus codeveloped with Israeli companies in the last two years, also includes an integrated weapons system dubbed H-Force which enables the pilot to easily operate the helicopters weaponry in flight, eliminating the need for a separate weapons officer on board.",
      "Dudek said another unique aspect of the Cypriot helicopters is an integrated battle management system that enables the aircraft to operate seamlessly with forces on the ground as well as other aircraft, including those belonging to the forces of other nations.",
      "Additionally, the helicopter\u2019s electronic warfare and other systems afford it a strong self-protection capability.",
      "Ethnically-divided Cyprus is in the process of modernizing its defensive capabilities to bring it up to modern European and NATO standards after years of relying on mainly Soviet-era, Russian-made weaponry. The island nation continues to operate Russian-made T-80 main battle tanks, but has recently sold off 11 Russian-made Mi35 attack helicopters to Serbia.",
      "Cyprus was split in 1974, when Turkey invaded following a coup by Athens junta-backed supporters of uniting the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence and maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s northern third.",
      "The Cypriot defense minister said the helicopter purchase is part of wider strategic planning for the continuous upgrading of the National Guard, enabling the island to take part in joint military drills with friendly nations.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

    "story": [
      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China launched a spacecraft that promises to return samples from an asteroid near Mars and yield \u201cgroundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity\u2019s knowledge of the cosmos,\" the country's space agency said.",
      "The Tianwen-2 probe launched early Thursday from southern China aboard the workhorse Long March 3-B rocket. The probe will collect samples from the asteroid 2016HO3 and explore the main-belt comet 311P, which lies even further from the Earth than Mars, according to the China National Space Administration.",
      "Shan Zhongde, head of the CNSA, was quoted as saying the Tianwen-2 mission represents a \u201dsignificant step in China\u2019s new journey of interplanetary exploration\u201d and over its decade-long mission will \u201cyield groundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity\u2019s knowledge of the cosmos.\u201d",
      "Samples from 2016HO3 are due to be returned in about two years. The asteroids, chosen for their relatively stable orbits, hopefully will offer clues into the formation of earth, such as the origins of water.",
      "China earlier returned rock samples from the moon's far side back to Earth in a historic mission and has welcomed international cooperation. However, any cooperation with the U.S. hinges on removing an American law banning direct bilateral cooperation with NASA.",
      "The near side of the moon is seen from Earth and the far side faces outer space. The far side also is known to have mountains and impact craters and is much more difficult to reach.",
      "China also operates the three person-crewed Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station, making the country a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since the station was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",
      "China\u2019s space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",
      "The country\u2019s space program has grown rapidly in the more than 20 years since it first put a man in space, only the third country to do so under its own speed. The space agency has landed an unmanned explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",
      "A future Tianwen-4 Jupiter mission will explore Jupiter, although details haven't been released.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "An Australian woman on trial for the triple murder of her estranged husband's relatives and the attempted murder of another has told the Supreme Court in the state of Victoria that she carefully planned the July 2023 lunch where her dinner guests were ...",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Before Erin Patterson\u2019s in-laws and their relatives arrived at her home for lunch, she bought pricey ingredients, consulted friends about recipes and sent her children out to a movie.",
      "Then, the Australian woman served them a dish containing poisonous death cap mushrooms \u2014 a meal that was fatal for three of her four guests.",
      "Whether that was Patterson\u2019s plan is at the heart of a triple murder trial that has gripped Australia for nearly six weeks.",
      "Prosecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say the accused lured her guests to lunch with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi.",
      "But her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington she served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap. She denies murdering her estranged husband\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson.",
      "The mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.",
      "On Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch in July 2023 and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn't become sick herself.",
      "No one disputes that Patterson, 50, served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.",
      "Patterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \u201csomething special\u201d to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \u201cbland\u201d flavor, she said.",
      "She believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.",
      "\"Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\u201d she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.",
      "Patterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \u201churt\u201d when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d attending.",
      "She earlier told his relatives that she'd arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.",
      "In reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.",
      "\u201cI was ashamed of the fact that I didn\u2019t have control over my body or what I ate,\u201d a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell anybody, but I shouldn\u2019t have lied to them.\u201d",
      "The accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.",
      "Patterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.",
      "At the hospital where her guests' health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.",
      "\u201cIs that how you poisoned my parents?\u201d she said Simon Patterson asked her.",
      "Growing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she\u2019d never owned one and hadn\u2019t foraged for mushrooms before.",
      "While still at the hospital, she insisted she'd bought all the mushrooms at stores even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.",
      "She was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.",
      "Also later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cell phone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she\u2019d foraged.",
      "Prosecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband\u2019s family on purpose, although they didn't suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.",
      "The trial continues on Thursday with Patterson's cross-examination by the prosecutors. If convicted, she faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder.",

By denying the federal watchdog access to the department's records, the lawmakers believe McMahon is failing to meet her obligation as an agency head. There is no basis to withhold department documents from the OIG regardless of the privileged nature of the information or if it\u2019s subject to litigation, the OIG said.",
      "The news comes as McMahon testifies before Congress on the agency\u2019s priorities and policies, specifically calling for a $12 billion cut to education under President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget outline. McMahon has stressed she will continue all statutory functions of the agency and work to abolish it in a \u201clawful fashion.\u201d",
      "Ahead of his committee's hearing with McMahon, Scott said, \u201cWe hear all these pronouncements about what's going to happen. What is the plan? They've acknowledged they can't get rid of the Department of Education without legislation. Are they supporting legislation?\u201d",
      "Democrats, including Scott, have decried the administration\u2019s work force reductions, particularly the impact the layoffs could pose to the department\u2019s critical responsibilities such as administering Federal Student Aid services and ensuring students\u2019 civil rights. Their three-page letter to McMahon claims states have experienced delays in accessing relevant portals to receive federal funding, college financial aid advisors have experienced significant delays in getting answers from FSA personnel, parents with pending Office for Civil Rights OCR cases have been left in the dark.",
      "\u201cWhen they have all these cases of discrimination in the Office for Civil Rights enforcing Title VI, including anti semitism, how is the job going to get done if you fired most of the staff in the Office of Civil Rights?\u201d Scott said.",
      "\u201cIf the inspector general can't get an answer, then oversight is lost,\u201d he added.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Top Trump administration officials \u2014 fresh off touring one of the country's largest oil fields in the Alaska Arctic \u2014 headlined an energy conference led by the state's Republican governor on Tuesday that environmentalists criticized as promoting new oil and gas drilling and turning away from the climate crisis.",
      "Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.",
      "Calls for additional oil and gas drilling \u2014 including Trump\u2019s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built \u2014 are \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cAlaska is Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cProtect our Public Lands.\u201d",
      "\"We find it really disingenuous that they\u2019re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.",
      "Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich\u2019in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich\u2019in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.",
      "\u201cWhen these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,\u201d Adams said, adding later: \u201cIt's our health that will be impacted. It\u2019s our wellness, our ways of life.\u201d",
      "Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear \u201cto be victims of their surroundings\u201d and seemed \u201chappy.\u201d",
      "Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Wright bristled at the idea of policy \"in the name of climate change\u201d that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.",
      "\u201cYou know, we hear terms like clean energy and renewable energy. These are inaccurate marketing terms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no energy source that does not take significant materials, land and impact on the environment to produce. Zero.\u201d",
      "Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.",
      "Wright told reporters a goal in inviting them to the Prudhoe Bay stop was for them to see the oil pipeline infrastructure and environment and meet with residents and business leaders.",
      "Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of \u201cpotential partners.\" Costs surrounding the project \u2014 which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure \u2014 are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.",

      "Hurricane season started on Sunday, June 1, and goes through Nov. 30. It is unclear if Richardson, who has led the agency since mid-May, was joking in the Monday meeting, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson argued he was.",
      "When asked by reporters Tuesday during a White House press briefing whether President Donald Trump is \"still comfortable\" with Richardson following his remarks, press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns and said FEMA is taking hurricane season \"seriously, contrary to some of the reporting we have seen based on jokes that were made and leaks from meetings.\"",
      "Reuters first reported on Richardson's comments.",
      "Richardson's comments follow an internal review indicating FEMA is \"not ready\" for the 2025 hurricane season in mid-May.",

      "\"Trump's FEMA chief is incompetent,\" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., added. \"People will die.\"",
      "The meeting was held Monday morning after Richardson had said he would update staff on a plan to tackle hurricane season.",
      "\"It's not a secret that under Secretary Noem and acting Administrator Richardson, FEMA is shifting from bloated, D.C.-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" the spokesperson added. \"The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.\"",
      "However, sources in the meeting said Richardson is sticking with the original plan, made during the Biden administration, in order to avoid getting in the way of FEMA's Review Council, which was established by President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Dan Stoneking, a former FEMA official and owner of Stoneking Strategic Communications, argued this reveals that the Trump administration believes its best chance at success this hurricane season is relying on the last administration's plan, rather than its own.",
      "Still, Stoneking said the original plan was created with more funding and before thousands of employees departed FEMA since the Trump administration took over, which he said would \"clearly necessitate changes in planning in order to be successful.\"",
      "\"This is not laser-focused. This is not empowering,\" he said. \"It is nothing more than a preamble to a less efficient federal response that this administration has caused but will still erroneously and egregiously blame on their predecessors.\"",
      "\"You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time,\" he added.",
      "Leavitt denied that the United States is ill-prepared to handle disasters, saying, \"The president will deeply and thoughtfully consider any requests for federal aid that come to his desk.\"",

      "\"Usually, the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) and the Forest Service aren\u2019t happy with the inholdings,\" Risch said.",

      "A federal judge has thrown out murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal judge has thrown out murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Brown ruled Tuesday that Sung Kim, a 26-year veteran of the Atlanta police department, acted in self defense and shouldn't face charges in the 2019 killing of 21-year-old Jimmy Atchison.",
      "\u201cThe evidence for self-defense is so overwhelming it is hard to understand how Georgia could have brought these charges in the first place, much less continued with them over the two-and-a-half years since,\" Brown wrote in his ruling. \u201cDefendant's shooting of Mr. Atchison was textbook self-defense.\u201d",
      "Kim was indicted in state court in 2022, but moved his case to federal court because he was assigned to an FBI fugitive task force when the shooting happened and thus was a federal officer.",
      "Atlanta activists have cited Atchison's death as an example of unjustified police violence against Black people. His name was often chanted by Atlanta protesters during Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020.",
      "The shooting also sparked policy changes. The Atlanta Police Department withdrew its officers from federal task forces because task force members weren't allowed to wear body cameras, meaning there is no video of Atchison's shooting. Officers returned after federal agencies began allowing local task force officers to wear cameras.",
      "Atchison was killed on Jan. 22, 2019, after Kim and other task force members tried to arrest him on charges that he stole a woman\u2019s purse and cellphone in an armed robbery. Kim retired from the Atlanta Police Department several months later. A Fulton County grand jury indicted Kim on charges that included felony murder and involuntary manslaughter.",
      "Officers forced their way into an apartment, prompting Atchison to jump out of a window, run through a second building and hide beneath a mound of clothes in a closet in another apartment. In his ruling, Brown rejected claims by a state witness that officers violated generally accepted police practices by entering the other apartment and the bedroom where Atchison was hiding.",
      "Testimony showed Kim shot Atchison in the face after Kim either yelled for Atchison to not move or show his hands. Atchison suddenly moved his hands from under the clothes. Family members say Atchison was raising his hands to surrender when Kim shot him in the face. Kim and other officers testified that they believed Atchison's move was threatening, as if he had a gun. Brown ruled that fear was reasonable and justified a shooting in self-defense.",
      "\u201cNothing required defendant to hold off shooting until he literally saw a gun in Mr. Atchison's hand,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe had a reasonable belief Mr. Atchison was armed and was going to shoot him. That is all that matters.\u201d",
      "Nabika Atchison, Jimmy Atchison's sister, said in a statement that relatives are \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Brown's decision, \u201cbut with today's climate surrounding police brutality, I can't say we are surprised.\u201d",
      "Tanya Miller, a Democratic state House member and lawyer representing the Atchison family, said the decision is a \u201cpainful subversion of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision underscores the troubling gap in accountability when local officers operate on federal task forces \u2014 a no-man's land where they can violate their own department's policies, the Constitution, take a young life, and still avoid standing trial,\u201d Miller wrote in a text message.",
      "Don Samuel, a lawyer for Kim, said via email that the ruling was correct.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to celebrate when a young man died,\" Samuel wrote, \"but there is no doubt that the decision of the Fulton County DA\u2019s office to compound the tragedy by prosecuting Sung Kim was an inexcusable abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\"",
      "The Georgia state conference of the NAACP called on Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to appeal the ruling, saying it unjustly shields officers from accountability when they kill unarmed people.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is not just a blow to the Atchison family's pursuit of justice \u2014 it's a threat to civil rights and public safety across the nation,\u201d said Gerald Griggs, president of the Georgia NAACP.",

      "A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message to hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance.",
      "The Biden policy requiring doctors to provide emergency abortions was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold her local emergency room after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "A team of scientists is driving into severe storms to study hail",
      "SHAMROCK, Texas -- As severe storms once again soak, twist and pelt the nation's midsection, a team of dozens of scientists is driving into them to study one of the nation's costliest but least-appreciated weather dangers: Hail.",
      "Hail rarely kills, but it hammers roofs, cars and crops to the tune of $10 billion a year in damage in the U.S. So in one of the few federally funded science studies remaining after Trump administration cuts, teams from several universities are observing storms from the inside and seeing how the hail forms. Project ICECHIP has already collected and dissected hail the size of small cantaloupes, along with ice balls of all sizes and shapes.",
      "Scientists in two hail-dimpled vehicles with special mesh protecting the windshields are driving straight into the heart of the storms, an area known as the \u201cshaft\u201d where the hail pelting is the most intense. It's a first-of-its-kind icy twist on tornado chasing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting experience. It sounds like somebody on the outside of your vehicle is hitting you with a hammer,\u201d said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini, one of the lead researchers.",
      "A team of journalists from The Associated Press joined them this week in a several-day trek across the Great Plains, starting Tuesday morning in northern Texas with a weather briefing before joining a caravan of scientists and students looking for ice.",
      "The caravan features more than a dozen radar trucks and weather balloon launching vehicles. At each site, the scientists load and unload drones, lasers and cameras and other specialized equipment. There are foam pads to measure hail impact and experimental roofing material. There are even special person-sized funnels to collect pristine hail before it hits the ground and becomes tainted with dirt.",
      "Already in treks across Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the team has found hail measuring more than 5 inches (13 centimeters) in diameter \u2014 bigger than a softball, but not quite a soccer ball. The team's equipment and vehicles already sport dings, dimples and dents that scientists show off like battle scars.",
      "\u201cWe got a few good whacks,\u201d said forensic engineer Tim Marshall, who was carrying roofing samples to see if there were ways shingles could better handle hail. \u201cI look at broken, busted stuff all the time.\u201d",
      "At Tuesday's weather briefing, retired National Weather Service forecaster David Imy pointed to potential hot spots this week in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Computer models show the potential for a \u201cmonster storm down here near the Red River\" later in the week, he said. Acting on the latest forecasts, Gensini and other leaders told the team to head to Altus, Oklahoma, but be ready to cross the Red River back into Texas at a moment\u2019s notice.",
      "A few hours after his briefing, Imy had the opportunity to chase one of the bigger storms, packing what radar showed was large hail at 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) in the air. Because of the warm air closer to the surface, the hail was only pea sized by the time it hit the ground. But the outing still provided good data and beautiful views for Imy, who was with a group that stationed themselves about a half-mile from the center of the storm.",
      "\u201cBeautiful colors: turquoise, bluish green, teal,\u201d Imy said, pointing to the mushroom shaped cloud dominating the sky. \u201cThis is beauty to me and also seeing the power of nature.\u201d",
      "This is not just a bunch of scientists looking for an adrenaline rush or another sequel to the movie \u201cTwister.\u201d It's serious science research into weather that damages a lot of crops in the Midwest, Gensini said. Hail damage is so costly that the insurance industry is helping to pay for the mission, which is primarily funded by the National Science Foundation.",
      "\u201cThese are the stones that do the most damage to lives and property,\u201d Gensini said. \u201cWe want the biggest hail possible.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Gensini found that as the world warms from human-caused climate change, small hailstones will become less likely while the larger ones become more common. The bigger, more damaging ones that the ICECHIP team is studying are projected to increase 15% to 75% this century depending on how much the world warms. That's because the stronger updrafts in storms would keep stones aloft longer to get bigger, but the heat would melt the tinier ones.",
      "The experiment is unique because of the combination of driving into the hail and deploying numerous radars and weather balloons to get an overall picture of how the storms work, Gensini said, adding that hail is often overlooked because researchers have considered it a lower priority than other extreme weather events.",
      "Outside scientists said the research mission looks promising because there are a lot of unanswered questions about hail. Hail is the No. 1 reason for soaring costs in billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, said meteorologist Jeff Masters, who cofounded Weather Underground and is now at Yale Climate Connections.",
      "\u201cNow a large part of that reason is because we simply have more people with more stuff in harm\u2019s way,\" said Masters, who wasn't part of the research. \u201cInsurance has become unaffordable in a lot of places and hail has become a big reason.\"",
      "In Colorado, hail is \u201cactually our most costly natural disaster,\u201d said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado, adding that \u201chail does such incredible damage to property.\"",

    "story": [
      "The effort to protect the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade was long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development",
      "NEW YORK -- Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers.",
      "A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets.",
      "But the Trump administration's recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,\u201d said V\u00e1squez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. \"We think the situation is going to get worse.\u201d",
      "Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. \u201cWe really needed those resources,\u201d he said.",
      "When Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world.",
      "USAID\u2019s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change.",
      "That included V\u00e1squez's organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. V\u00e1squez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration.",
      "In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs.",
      "\u201cForeign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. \u201cUnfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.\u201d",
      "Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation.",
      "Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights.",
      "In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It's now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government.",
      "The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country's agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,\u201d V\u00e1squez said.",
      "The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE\u2019s cuts to USAID a \u201cmindless\u201d setback to years of work.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "USAID\u2019s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger.",
      "One of the most recent additions to USAID\u2019s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy.",
      "Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank.",
      "\u201cThat provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,\u201d Rieser said. \u201cThat has now been silenced.\u201d",
      "That adviser position remains unfilled.",
      "Vy Lam, USAID's adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "He said concepts such as \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d \u2014 the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights \u2014 were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy.",
      "One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments.",
      "For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation.",
      "\u201cWe had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,\u201d Lam said.",
      "U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area.",
      "In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses.",
      "Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N.",
      "At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy.",
      "In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant.",
      "In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings \"are actual victims of human rights violations,\u201d Flores said. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it\u2019s really just an injustice.\u201d",

      "The arrest, first reported by NBC News, took place Tuesday evening at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, according to the officials. One official identified the suspect as Daniel Park, 32, of Kent, Washington.",
      "Investigators believe the bomber died in the blast. It was not immediately clear what Park was charged with or how he was connected to the investigation.",
      "The law enforcement officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a criminal case that has not been publicly disclosed.",
      "The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the apparent car bomb detonation, and investigators say he had nihilistic and \u201canti-pro-life\u201d writings. A body was found near a charred vehicle outside the clinic.",
      "Officials said at the time they were investigating whether Bartkus had any help. He attempted to livestream the explosion and left behind writings that were still being examined to determine his state of mind, the FBI said.",
      "The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palms Springs and shattered the windows of nearby buildings along a palm tree-lined street. Witnesses described a loud boom followed by a chaotic scene, with people screaming in terror and glass strewn along the sidewalk and street.",
      "A senior FBI official called the explosion possibly the \u201clargest bombing scene that we\u2019ve had in Southern California.\u201d",

      "Edmund White, the groundbreaking man of letters who documented and imagined the gay revolution through journalism, essays, memoirs and novels, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Edmund White, the groundbreaking man of letters who documented and imagined the gay revolution through journalism, essays, plays and such novels as \"A Boy's Own Story\" and \"The Beautiful Room is Empty,\" has died. He was 85.",
      "White's death was confirmed Wednesday by his agent, Bill Clegg, who did not immediately provide additional details.",
      "Along with Larry Kramer, Armistead Maupin and others, White was among a generation of gay writers who in the 1970s became bards for a community no longer afraid to declare its existence. He was present at the Stonewall raids of 1969, when arrests at a club in Greenwich Village led to the birth of the modern gay movement, and for decades was a participant and observer through the tragedy of AIDS, the advance of gay rights and culture and the backlash of recent years.",
      "A resident of New York and Paris for much of his adult life, he was a novelist, journalist, biographer, playwright, activist, teacher and memoirist. \"A Boy's Own Story\" was a bestseller and classic coming-of-age novel that demonstrated gay literature's commercial appeal. He wrote a prizewinning biography of playwright Jean Genet and books on Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud. He was a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, where colleagues included Toni Morrison and his close friend, Joyce Carol Oates. He was an encyclopedic reader who absorbed literature worldwide while returning yearly to such favorites as Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d and Henry Green\u2019s \u201cNothing.\u201d",
      "\"Among gay writers of his generation, Edmund White has emerged as the most versatile man of letters,\" cultural critic Morris Dickstein wrote in The New York Times in 1995. \"A cosmopolitan writer with a deep sense of tradition, he has bridged the gap between gay subcultures and a broader literary audience.\"",
      "In early 1982, just as the public was learning about AIDS, White was among the founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis, which advocated AIDS prevention and education. The author himself would learn that he was HIV-positive in 1985, and would remember friends afraid to be kissed by him, even on the cheek, and parents who didn't want him to touch their babies.",
      "White survived, but watched countless peers and loved ones suffer agonizing deaths. Out of the seven gay men, including White, who formed the influential writing group the Violet Quill, four died of complications from AIDS. As White wrote in his elegiac novel \"The Farewell Symphony,\" the story followed a shocking arc: \"Oppressed in the fifties, freed in the sixties, exalted in the seventies and wiped out in the eighties.\"",
      "But in the 1990s and after he lived to see gay people granted the right to marry and serve in the military, to see gay-themed books taught in schools and to see gay writers so widely published that they no longer needed to write about gay lives.",
      "\"We're in this post-gay period where you can announce to everybody that you yourself are gay, and you can write books in which there are gay characters, but you don't need to write exclusively about that,\" he said in a Salon interview in 2009. \"Your characters don't need to inhabit a ghetto any more than you do. A straight writer can write a gay novel and not worry about it, and a gay novelist can write about straight people.\"",
      "In 2019, White received a National Book Award medal for lifetime achievement, an honor previously given to Morrison and Philip Roth among others.",
      "\u201cTo go from the most maligned to a highly lauded writer in a half-century is astonishing,\u201d White said during his acceptance speech.",
      "White was born in Cincinnati in 1940, but age at 7 moved with his mother to the Chicago area after his parents divorced. His father was a civil engineer \"who reigned in silence over dinner as he studied his paper.\" His mother a psychologist \"given to rages or fits of weeping.\" Trapped in \"the closed, sniveling, resentful world of childhood,\" at times suicidal, White was at the same time a \u201cfierce little autodidact\u201d who sought escape through the stories of others, whether Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice\" or a biography of the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.",
      "\"As a young teenager I looked desperately for things to read that might excite me or assure me I wasn't the only one, that might confirm my identity I was unhappily piecing together,\" he wrote in the essay \"Out of the Closet, On to the Bookshelf,\" published in 1991.",
      "As he wrote in \"A Boy's Own Story,\" he knew as a child that he was attracted to boys, but for years was convinced he must change \u2014 out of a desire to please his father (whom he otherwise despised) and a wish to be \"normal.\" Even as he secretly wrote a \u201ccoming out\u201d novel while a teenager, he insisted on seeing a therapist and begged to be sent to boarding school. One of the funniest and saddest episodes from \"A Boy's Own Story\" told of a brief crush he had on a teenage girl, ended by a polite and devastating note of rejection.",
      "\u201cFor the next few months I grieved,\u201d White writes. \u201cI would stay up all night crying and playing records and writing sonnets to Helen. What was I crying for?\u201d",
      "He had a whirling, airborne imagination and New York and Paris had been in his dreams well before he lived in either place. After graduating from the University of Michigan, where he majored in Chinese, he moved to New York in the early 1960s and worked for years as a writer for Time-Life Books and an editor for The Saturday Review. He would interview Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote among others, and, for some assignments, was joined by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.",
      "Socially, he met Burroughs, Jasper Johns, Christopher Isherwood and John Ashbery. He remembered drinking espresso with an ambitious singer named Naomi Cohen, whom the world would soon know as \"Mama Cass\" of the Mamas and Papas. He feuded with Kramer, Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag, an early supporter who withdrew a blurb for \"A Boy's Own Story\" after he caricatured her in the novel \"Caracole.\"",
      "\"In all my years of therapy I never got to the bottom of my impulse toward treachery, especially toward people who'd helped me and befriended me,\" he later wrote.",
      "Through much of the 1960s, he was writing novels that were rejected or never finished. Late at night, he would \"dress as a hippie, and head out for the bars.\" A favorite stop was the Stonewall, where he would down vodka tonics and try to find the nerve to ask a man he had crush on to dance. He was in the neighborhood on the night of June 28, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall and \"all hell broke loose.\"",
      "\"Up until that moment we had all thought homosexuality was a medical term,\" wrote White, who soon joined the protests. \"Suddenly we saw that we could be a minority group \u2014 with rights, a culture, an agenda.\"",
      "Before the 1970s, few novels about openly gay characters existed beyond Vidal\u2019s \u201cThe City and the Pillar\u201d and James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room.\u201d Classics such as William Burroughs\u2019 \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d had \u201crendered gay life as exotic, marginal, even monstrous,\u201d according to White. But the world was changing, and publishing was catching up, releasing fiction by White, Kramer, Andrew Holleran and others.",
      "White\u2019s debut novel, the surreal and suggestive \"Forgetting Elena,\" was published in 1973. He collaborated with Charles Silverstein on \"The Joy of Gay Sex,\" a follow-up to the bestselling \"The Joy of Sex\" that was updated after the emergence of AIDS. In 1978, his first openly gay novel, \"Nocturnes for the King of Naples,\" was released and he followed with the nonfiction \"States of Desire,\" his attempt to show \"the varieties of gay experience and also to suggest the enormous range of gay life to straight and gay people \u2014 to show that gays aren\u2019t just hairdressers, they\u2019re also petroleum engineers and ranchers and short-order cooks.\"",
      "With \"A Boy's Own Story,\" published in 1982, he began an autobiographical trilogy that continued with \"The Beautiful Room is Empty\" and \"The Farewell Symphony,\" some of the most sexually direct and explicit fiction to land on literary shelves. Heterosexuals, he wrote in \"The Farewell Symphony,\" could \"afford elusiveness.\" But gays, \"easily spooked,\" could not \"risk feigning rejection.\"",
      "His other works included \"Skinned Alive: Stories\" and the novel \u201cA Previous Life,\u201d in which he turns himself into a fictional character and imagines himself long forgotten after his death.

Soliman, an Egyptian man who federal authorities say has been living in the U.S. illegally, didn\u2019t carry out his full plan \u201cbecause he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,\u201d police wrote in an affidavit.",

      "A vigil was scheduled for Wednesday evening at the local Jewish community center to support those impacted by the attack.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department reports.",

      "His attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after a state court hearing Monday.",
      "Witnesses and police have said Soliman threw two incendiary devices, catching himself on fire as he hurled the second. Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. Although they did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.",
      "The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.",
      "The victims ranged in age from 52 to 88, and their injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. They were members of the volunteer group called Run For Their Lives who were holding their weekly demonstration.",

Environmental advocates vowed to appeal the matter to the state's top court.",

      "The boy's beating in 2023 at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall was captured on surveillance video that also showed several officials standing idly by and some of them shaking hands with the participants in the beating.",
      "A state grand jury in March charged 30 correctional officers for their role in allowing and sometimes encouraging nearly 70 fights to take place between July and December 2023. The officers face charges including child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery.",
      "More than 140 victims between the ages of 12 and 18 were involved, according to authorities.",
      "Attorney General Rob Bonta said after the charges were announced that it seemed the attacks were planned.",
      "\u201cThey often wanted them to happen at the beginning of the day, in a certain time, in a certain place. A space and a time was created for the fights, and the plan was for the fights to happen,\u201d he said.",
      "The investigation began after the Los Angeles Times first obtained and published video footage that shows a then-16-year-old being attacked by at least six other young people, who came at him one by one as officers stand by watching.",
      "The video was first made public during a court hearing during which a public defender for the boy, now 17, argued to a judge that he was not safe at Los Padrinos and should be released ahead of his trial.",
      "His attorney, Jamal Tooson, said the settlement was a \u201cfirst step\u201d in recognizing the \u201cegregious\u201d conduct of the LA County Probation Department.",
      "\u201cOur priority needs to be not just protecting my client but all children in similar circumstances under the care and watch of the probation department,\u201d Tooson said. \u201cThere were lawsuits prior to this. I personally represent several individuals who've been harmed at the same facility after this.\u201d",
      "According to a correction action plan written by the department, staff failed to review CCTV footage of the facility, delayed taking the teen to the hospital, and waited too long to notify his parents. To address these issues, the department will ensure CCTV monitors are \u201cstaffed routinely\u201d and conduct random footage audits, and develop a protocol for making sure young people in custody are given medical care and their parents are informed appropriately.",
      "A judge ruled in April that the LA County Probation Department could not continue housing juveniles at Los Padrinos and approved a plan in May to move more than 100 youths out of the facility. California's state board overseeing local correctional facilities has previously ordered Los Padrinos to be shut down.",
      "Tooson believes there is a pervasive \u201cculture problem\u201d extending throughout the probation department's facilities that cannot be addressed by the correction action plan. He has filed at least 19 lawsuits in federal court alleging issues from physical violence allowed by officials to sexual assault by staff members in LA County's youth detention centers, he said.",
      "\u201cUntil we actively start changing the mindset and behavior of those who are put into a caretaking responsibility of these youth, I think we're going to find ourselves in the same situation,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year so she can continue to receive treatment she has been getting since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023, according to a copy of a letter received by Rebecca Brown, an attorney for the family from the nonprofit Public Counsel.",

      "The Trump administration has been pushing to dismantle policies from former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that granted temporary legal status for certain migrants and allowed them to live legally in the U.S., generally for two years.",
      "The girl was taken to a hospital upon arriving on at the U.S.-Mexico border with her mother in 2023 and released once she was stable enough. She receives intravenous nutrition through a special backpack for short bowel syndrome, which prevents her from being able to take in and process nutrients on her own, and lawyers said the treatment she receives is necessary at this stage for her to survive and isn't available in Mexico.",
      "The family's attorneys from Public Counsel said in a statement that while they were grateful the administration \u201cacted swiftly\u201d to ensure the girl could continue her life-saving treatment, they hoped the case highlighted the need for better communication with federal immigration officials.",
      "\u201cWe cannot ignore the systemic challenges that brought Sofia to the brink,\u201d the attorneys said, using a pseudonym for the girl. \u201cHer parole was terminated without warning ... It took an international outcry and pressure from elected officials to get a response\u2014something that used to take a single phone call.\u201d",
      "Humanitarian parole, which doesn\u2019t put migrants on a path to U.S. citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to alleviate pressure on the U.S.-Mexico southern border. It was previously used on a case-by-case basis to address individual emergencies and also for people fleeing humanitarian crises around the world including Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the late 1970s.",
      "In Mexico, the girl was largely confined to a hospital because of her medical condition, said her mother, Deysi Vargas. After joining a program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, she can now receive treatment at home in Bakersfield, California, and go to the park and store like other children, Vargas has said.",
      "Lawyers said the girl's medical treatment, which requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition, will not be necessary indefinitely but that she is not at the point where she could live without it.",

      "The Trump administration's Department of Education says a Connecticut school system is under investigation over its transgender athletic policy",
      "A school system in Connecticut that's at the center of an ongoing legal fight over allowing transgender student athletes to participate in competitive girls' sports is being investigated by the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Education confirmed Tuesday, adding a new flashpoint in the national debate over trans girls\u2019 participation in youth sports.",
      "James Demetriades, the mayor of Cromwell, said the town's school system could lose nearly $1 million in federal special education funding if the department determines it\u2019s in violation of Title IX, the federal civil rights law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal assistance.",
      "The mayor, a Democrat, said Monday the school district would be ineligible for the state\u2019s athletic conference if it didn't allow student athletes to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "He said the district is currently following \u201call applicable state and federal law as well as the rules for the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference,\" the governing body for secondary school athletics in the state. In an interview on Tuesday, Demetriades said Cromwell currently has \u201cno gender diverse\u201d high school CIAC athletes.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know why Cromwell was targeted for this action,\u201d Demetriades said in a statement on Facebook. He said the investigation also includes restroom and locker room usage.",
      "CIAC's policy of allowing transgender girls to compete in girls high school sports was first challenged in 2020 by four runners who said they were unfairly forced to race against transgender sprinters from Cromwell and Bloomfield. CIAC argued its policy is designed to comply with a state law that requires all high school students be treated according to their gender identity. It has also said the policy is in accordance with Title IX.",
      "While a federal appeals court in 2022 dismissed the plaintiffs' challenge to CIAC\u2019s policy, saying they lacked standing and had not been deprived of a \u201cchance to be champions,\u201d the suit was later revived in 2023 and is currently pending. It could be ready for a trial in 2026.",
      "The head of the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, Craig Trainor, said in a statement that the investigation was looking at whether Cromwell's policies were \u201cdepriving girls and young women of equal athletic opportunities.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon added that, \u201cThis Administration will fight on every front to protect women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports.\u201d",
      "A community of more than 14,000, Cromwell is about 20 minutes south of the capital, Hartford. A rally in support of transgender youth was planned Tuesday evening at Cromwell High School.",
      "In 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, the Office for Civil Rights launched an investigation into the policy in Connecticut that allows transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. It determined the actions of the CIAC, Cromwell and several other communities in Connecticut resulted in \u201cthe loss of athletic benefits and opportunities for female student-athletes.\u201d",
      "Days after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order titled \u201c Keeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\" which states that all funds from educational programs \u201cthat deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy,\u201d will be rescinded.",
      "In his post, Demetriades asked state officials to help hold the town harmless from liability and intervene if Cromwell is sued by the Department of Justice.",
      "In March, the Department of Education opened an investigation into Portland Public Schools, Oregon\u2019s largest school district, over allowing a transgender athlete to compete on a high school girls\u2019 track-and-field team.",

      "A man in central Washington state is wanted on suspicion of murder after his three young daughters were reported missing and then found dead.",
      "Authorities asked the public Tuesday for help finding Travis Decker, 32, who is wanted for three counts of murder and kidnapping, according to police in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle.",
      "Police said it was unknown whether Decker, a former Army soldier with \u201cextensive training,\u201d was armed.",
      "On Friday the mother of the girls, ages 9, 8 and 5, reported that their father did not return them after a planned visit, police said.",
      "Over the weekend authorities looked for the children and for Decker, who was believed to be living out of a white 2017 GMC Sierra pickup with Washington plates.",
      "Police said Decker's unoccupied truck was found Monday near a campground west of the city of Leavenworth, which is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Wenatchee. Officers found the girls' bodies during a search.",
      "Anyone who may have seen Decker since Friday or knows his current location was asked to call 911.",
      "\u201cDue to safety concerns do not attempt to contact or approach Decker,\u201d police said.",
      "The Wenatchee School District said the girls were students of Lincoln Elementary. Counseling services were available, and the district asked people to respect the privacy of students, staff members and families and come to the campus only for regular school business.",
      "The mother told police that Decker picked the girls up around 5 p.m. but had not returned them by 8 p.m., and his phone went straight to voicemail, according to a probable cause affidavit written by a Wenatchee police detective, The Seattle Times reported.",
      "The detective said she \u201cexpressed concern because Decker reportedly has never done this before and \u2026 is currently experiencing some mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat prompted her to call us was that ... he was late returning the girls and had not communicated to her that he was going to be late, which was his typical fashion and so this was out of the ordinary,\u201d Capt. Brian Chance said.",
      "Washington State Patrol was contacted Friday night to request an Amber Alert, but it did not meet the required criteria, Wenatchee police said. The following day Wanatchee detectives contacted the patrol with additional information that led to the issuance of an Endangered Missing Person Alert.",
      "The lacking criteria was suspected abduction and imminent peril of death or serious injury, said Chris Loftis, director of public affairs for the state patrol.",
      "\u201cIn this case, it was a parent with custodial privileges, and the children had not been returned home on time. But that\u2019s a rather common occurrence and not something where you just automatically assume abduction,\u201d he said, adding that there was no indication Decker, a custodial parent who had the children for a visit, would harm them.",
      "\"We\u2019re people too, you know, so the loss of a child, the loss of two children, the loss of three children is ... devastating,\" Loftis said. \u201cEverybody always looks to how we can improve.\u201d",
      "The alert systems are constantly evolving and this could prompt further change, Loftis said: \u201cObviously it didn\u2019t work this time. Obviously we have three children that are dead.\u201d",
      "Decker and the girls' mother are divorced, Chance said. He did not have details on how the girls were killed or on Decker's employment.",
      "Decker joined the Army in 2013 and transferred to the Washington National Guard in 2021, Washington Military Department spokesperson Karina Shagren told The Associated Press. He was a full-time member of the Guard until 2023 or 2024, when he switched to part-time.",
      "Decker stopped attending mandatory monthly drills a little over a year ago, and the Guard was in the process of a disciplinary discharge for him, Shagren said.",
      "\u201cThis is an absolute tragedy,\u201d Shagren said. \u201cWe are mourning along with the community.\u201d",
      "The Chelan County Sheriff's Office, which found the truck, was leading the search in the Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest area while other teams followed up on \u201cpotential credible information and tips\u201d regarding Decker's location, the agency said in a statement.",
      "The agency was working with U.S. Marshals to locate and apprehend Decker. A reward of up to $20,000 was available for information leading directly to his arrest.",

      "Jasper Greene, 23, of New Haven, was one of three men charged in the death of Mabel Martinez Antongiorgi on April 9, 2022. The 56-year-old woman was sewing in her home in Waterbury, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Hartford, when a bullet flew through a wall and hit her in the head.",
      "Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s daughter, Yarimar Mercado Martinez, competed for the family's native Puerto Rico in rifle shooting at the Olympics in 2016, 2021 and 2024. She was in Brazil for another competition when her mother was killed.",
      "Greene pleaded guilty to murder in February. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment after Tuesday's sentencing in Waterbury Superior Court.",
      "According to court testimony, the fatal shooting stemmed from a dispute that one of the suspects, Franklin Robinson, had with a man who said hello to his girlfriend. Robinson, Greene and another man shot up a car parked on Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s street, thinking the man was inside it. A bullet went into Martinez Antongiorgi\u2019s home. Another bystander was wounded but survived.",
      "A jury convicted Robinson of murder and other charges in 2023 and he was later sentenced to 90 years in prison.",
      "The third suspect, Levi Brock, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in the case, including murder, and awaits trial.",
      "At the time of her mother\u2019s death, Mercado Martinez lamented in social media posts that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t even say goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy you? Why this way?\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou were just sitting in your little house sewing, as you always did.\u201d",
      "Martinez Antongiorgi and her husband of over 30 years, John Luis Mercado, moved to Waterbury from Puerto Rico a few years after the U.S. territory endured 2017\u2019s devastating Hurricane Maria. At the time of her death, they had set a date to renew their wedding vows, their daughter wrote at the time.",

    "summary": "Charlene Kaye's musical parodies are racking up millions of views. But her story runs deeper.",
    "story": [
      "When Charlene Kaye first posted her Taylor Swift parody, she was so terrified of fan backlash that she only shared it on her Instagram close friends story.",
      "\"That is how afraid I was of the Swifties coming to murder me,\" she said.",
      "Now, the classically trained musician-turned-comedian has millions of views for her viral interpretations of pop music's biggest stars, dissecting everything from Swift to Lady Gaga's signature \"ro-ma-ma-poo-poo-pee-pee-ka-ka-ka\" lyrics.",
      "Kaye, who has a background in classical music theory, gained widespread attention last year when her collection of musical parodies went viral on platforms like TikTok. She breaks down the common musical elements from of the most popular songs and highlights what makes their songs so recognizable.",
      "\"Because I have background in classical music theory and because I also have a sense of humor, I was like, what if I just wrote a song that had all of the tropes that I notice,\" Kaye said.",
      "The strategy worked. Pop star Chappell Roan even responded positively to her own parody, commenting \"Exactly! You get it!\"",
      "Born in Honolulu to her mother Lily, a Chinese immigrant, Kaye's family eventually moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, where she was raised. Her musical journey began with guitar lessons in her bedroom and performances at local open mic nights and coffee shops.",
      "\"It was kind of a fight to assert my own identity and my own experience,\" she said.",
      "Her decision to pursue music professionally created tension with her immigrant mother, who grew up in poverty in 1960s Singapore.",
      "\"It is a luxury and a privilege to be a creative person,\" Kaye said.",
      "While studying English at the University of Michigan with plans to become a teacher, Kaye made a different choice.",
      "\"I ditched all my classes to play rock shows, find my people and decide that I wanted to be a rockstar,\" she said.",
      "Her early career included playing guitar for the cult favorite parody \"A Very Potter Musical\" alongside her friend, actor Darren Criss. She later moved to New York and joined indie rock band San Fermin.",
      "Kaye's comedy work draws heavily from her relationship with her mother. She produced a one-woman show titled \"Tiger Daughter, Or How I Brought My Immigrant Mother Ultimate Shame.\"",
      "Love you @Taylor Swift \ud83d\udc9d come see me live at the Bell House 2/25, NY!",
      "The show explores the concept of a \"tiger daughter,\" the child of a demanding \"tiger mother,\" who pushes children toward high achievement. Despite its rebellious humor, Kaye describes the show as ultimately a love letter to her mother.",
      "When asked if her mother is proud of her, Kaye said, \"I think she is in her own way. I think we'll always, there will always be a deep core of love even if there isn't the understanding part.\"",

      "The condom, possibly a souvenir from a brothel, is decorated with an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen.",
      "The phrase \"This is my choice\" is written along the sheath in French. According to the museum, this is a reference to the Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting \"The Judgment of Paris,\" which depicts the Trojan prince Paris judging a beauty contest between three goddesses.",
      "\"Acquiring the condom has enabled us to focus on 19th-century sexuality and prostitution, a subject that is underrepresented in our collection.

    "summary": "The writer-producer-voice artist behind the animated hit is also a crooner of the Great American Songbook. He is now releasing a new album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements.\"",
    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely (his composer for \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville\") combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",
      "Seth MacFarlane performs \"Give Me the Simple Life,\" from his album \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\":",
      "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Joel McNeely was the composer and arranger for \"Family Guy.\" He was in fact the composer for two other Seth MacFarlane series, \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Audra McDonald won her first Tony Award at 23, it was just the beginning of a record-breaking Broadway career. Earlier this month, she received her 11th Tony nomination, making her the most Tony-nominated actor of all time.",
      "McDonald received the nomination for her portrayal of Mama Rose in the latest Broadway revival of \"Gypsy.\" If she wins this Sunday, she'll make history as the performer with the most Tonys ever.",
      "Before she discovered the stage, McDonald described herself as a hyperactive kid who would express her emotions frequently.",
      "\"I had big feelings. I had music in my heart. And so once I found theater, it was like I have a place to put my big feelings now,\" she said.",
      "Those emotions are on full display as Mama Rose, a character based on the real-life mother of famed burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. It is currently being shown at the Majestic Theatre. In the musical, Mama Rose is an intense stage mom.",
      "McDonald first stepped into the role during a concert at Carnegie Hall in 2022, performing the musical's emotional climax \"Rose's Turn.\"",
      "\"It was the same time of year that I was getting ready to send my daughter off to college. And I was dealing with all this rage I was having at my sweet, wonderful daughter,\" McDonald said. \"And I burst into tears and I realized it's because my baby's leaving and I'm sad. So then that was my first sort, like, emotional dive into Rose.\"",
      "McDonald is the first Black woman to portray Mama Rose on Broadway. Director George C. Wolfe guided her interpretation of what Rose would be experiencing in the 1920s and 30s, with not one word of the original script changed.",
      "\"George talks a lot about Rose's obsession with the kids becoming stars is because being a star protects you in some way. You got star money, you could eat. You got star money, maybe you won't be lynched,\" McDonald explained. \"And so she as a single woman at this time, abandoned three times by her husbands, abandoned by her mother, not really treated all that well by her father, she's tryin' to protect these babies.\"",
      "Behind the Curtain",
      "The \"CBS Mornings\" interview went backstage to find out what happens when the curtain closes. McDonald and her co-star Danny Burstein are \"of a certain age,\" she laughed, noting they don't run up the stairs after performances.",
      "McDonald showed how she warms up to take on the demanding role.",
      "\"One thing that a lotta singers do is humming. Just like (humming), you're doing things like that just to sort of and people do that, whether you're singing or not. It's good just to sort of make sure that everything's sort of moving and healthy. And you know, to do it eight times a week,\" she said.",
      "Inspiring the next generation",
      "Despite her countless accolades, McDonald still struggles with being called a legend.",
      "\"If it can mean something to some little Black girl somewhere who says 'She did it and she looks like me so I can do it,' great,\" she said. \"But I can't really comprehend what that means to me about me. You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't, you know, as I see how dirty my closet is, and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks.\"",

      "\"Game of Thrones\" actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, are also among the crew. Hassan has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 departed from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "\"'Madleen' sails to Gaza today with twelve humanitarians and as much life-saving aid as she can carry, including baby formula, medical supplies, and more. She departs from European territorial waters, sailing entirely through international waters into Palestinian waters off Gaza,\" the coalition wrote\u00a0in a social media post Sunday. \"Unarmed and nonviolent, 'Madleen' poses no threat. She sails in full accordance with international law. Any attack or interference will be a deliberate, unlawful assault on civilians.\"",
      "As the crew tries to reach the shores of Gaza, they hope their trip will raise \"international awareness\" over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",

      "\"Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it's not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\" she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \"blood libel.\"",

      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",
      "\"We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\" said activist Thiago Avila.",

    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Emmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

    "summary": "A Minnesota woman is advocating for patients with FTD, a certain type of dementia that impacts impulse control and self-awareness.",
    "story": [
      "In the United States, one in three people face memory loss or dementia.",
      "In life, you never know what cards you'll be dealt. Linde Jacobs lost her mother in 2022, which makes being a mother to two young daughters tough.",
      "She's struggled with how to properly grieve and cope. She's struggling with making sure her daughters see strength and resilience.",
      "There's also the fear. Unlike most people, Jacobs knows what cards are in her own future.",
      "\"I was speechless in that appointment,\" Jacobs recalled. \"I had never been delivered news like that before. It was something so shocking that I really didn't know how to grasp it and internalize it.\"",
      "Aside from years of love, Jacobs' mother had also given her a cruel gene that causes a condition nearly impossible to diagnose.",
      "\"She was boundary-less\"",
      "Alison Lee was a proud mother of three girls, a successful physical therapist and a doting grandmother. But when she turned 50, life turned upside down.",
      "\"Some of her impulses would be to touch people in public, so if she saw someone, she would go pull some guy's pants up because she said, 'I can see your underwear.' She was boundary-less, she didn't realize the social norms we place on what is appropriate,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs, a nurse herself, pounded doctors for information. She was told it was depression but she knew there was more.",
      "Meanwhile Lee's bizarre behavior continued. She started shoplifting, and after dodging a traffic stop she ended up in jail.",
      "Jacobs' sister received a letter from a fellow inmate saying, \"your mom doesn't belong here, I think she has dementia.\"",
      "\"It was affirmation, first time we had somebody look into this from a third party perspective and say this is dementia,\" Jacobs said.",
      "It was a diagnosis no doctor had given. Lee hadn't lost her memory but she had lost the mind she once had, and something clicked with Jacobs.",
      "Turns out, that inmate known only as \"Angie\" was right. That was 2018, and Jacobs still marvels at the gesture.",
      "\"The incredible kindness of a stranger to know that not only did she recognize this, but she recognized my mom as being vulnerable and then kept her sane,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs now had a clear path thanks to a to a stranger she'd never be able to thank.",
      "But with the context of dementia, Jacobs was able to figure out a lot. She recalled that her grandmother had similar impulsive behaviors.",
      "It was genetic \u2014 it was the mapT mutation of frontal dementia known as FTD. It's a disease that hits at 50, and instead of losing memories, patients often lose impulse control and self-awareness.",
      "\"Honestly, I had a lot of guilt that I was so intolerant to those symptoms when my mom would display them,\" said Jacobs.",
      "Jacobs watched her mom progress; one day Lee fell and hit her head. Because of the FTD, her brain couldn't take the swelling and she died at 62, leaving devastation and frustration.",
      "\"I had that understanding level while she was alive, this is not her, she is not doing this to me, this is happening because this disease is causing this symptom,\" Jacobs said.",
      "But she says it was hard to separate her mom from those symptoms. Amidst the grief, she learned that she and her two sisters had the gene, too. Jacobs said immediately, her mind went to her little girls.",
      "\"Truly, that I passed it on to my daughters,\" she said.",
      "Jacobs realized that there was very little information about MapT. She could barely Google the condition that she was most certainly going to have.",
      "Then, she and her husband happened to see a documentary on gene editing.",
      "\"And so he just Google searched \"FTD, CRISPR,\" and then we came across a physician that's based out of San Francisco, Dr. Claire Clelland,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time\"",
      "In a busy laboratory on the other side of the country, Clelland received an email.",
      "\"I get contacted from patients, particularly gene carriers from around the world, but I remember just replying that I would try to help in the best way that I could,\" she said.",
      "That was the start of a powerful friendship.",
      "Jacobs set out on an advocacy journey across the nation, speaking to the nation's top neurologists and making them better understand this tricky and brutal disease that effects 40,000 Americans, essentially putting FTD on the map.",
      "Clelland said Jacobs' personal touch has fueled the process.",
      "\"And if you look at new therapies that make it through the pipeline and actually get to patients, often, they have patient supporters and champions that don't give up even when the work gets really hard,\" Clelland said.",
      "And that hard work landed Jacobs on the front page of the New York Times. From her frustration, to her grief, to that inmate's letter, she laid out her story for the world to see, giving her even more opportunity for revelations like the one she had in February inside a University of Minnesota research lab.",
      "It's there she saw a mouse with the frontal temporal dementia mutation she has. That mouse is a symbol of hope. It's part of promising research at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\"Linde sent me an email, she's actually the first FTD patient I've ever met,\" said Dr. Michael Koob, who is leading a team of researchers.",
      "Koob and his students are getting promising results for a treatment for people who know they have the gene.",
      "\"So, so for her, it's just a matter of time. This is going to happen. You know, at this point, I'm fairly confident that there will be an intervention that is going to work,\" said Koob.",
      "From the mice to the microscopes, things are looking up.",
      "WCCO followed Jacobs and her pursuit for two months. During that time, she had another breakthrough. It came at a coffee shop in River Falls, Wisconsin.",
      "A reunion",
      "After years, Jacobs finally found the inmate who had sent her the initial letter about her mom. She messaged her on Facebook, and the two set up a time to meet.",
      "When Jacobs met Angela Olson, the tears welled.",
      "\"I have no idea what the Lord is doing. I think it's amazing that he brought our lives together. I never realized, even writing that letter, what it was doing, right? I just knew that your mom was a really great person and needed help,\" said Olson.",
      "As they marveled at the letter, they marveled at the moment.",
      "\"I think there's so many times in life that, like, people are brought into our lives, right, for a poor purpose, right, and a bigger purpose,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"Yeah, she's actually the beginning of my journey with sobriety,\" said Olson.",
      "Olson knew the ropes when it came to jail; she was 20 years into her addiction.",
      "\"Never, all these years, my whole life, I never understood how to have, actually, emotions. It's like I was rejected in my life, betrayed by people, but yet understand how to have love or emotion, and just was so suppressed. And so then I ended up coming to Teen Challenge,\" Olson said.",
      "Now she's seven years sober and thriving as a manager at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Recovery program. She spends her days sharing her story.",
      "Olson recalled that Lee \"just kept repeating herself.\" As a nurse herself, she had some experience with dementia.",
      "She marveled at the New York Times article with her letter in it.",
      "\"Just reading how Linde said, you know, she was easily diagnosed by inmates before any doctor diagnosed this condition. And I was just, thank you, Lord,\" Olson said. \"Thank you that something that I did would help this woman.\"",
      "Now, Jacobs has another partner in her fight to honor her mother and protect her daughters. She recently was invited to a gala in New York, with Anna Wintour of Vogue helping to lead fundraising.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. approved a new COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna late Friday but with limits on who can use it \u2014 not a replacement for the company's existing shot, but a second option.",
      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",
      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in adults 65 and older and people age 12 to 64 who have at least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus.",
      "That's the same limit the FDA set in licensing another COVID-19 vaccine option from competitor Novavax.",
      "Those restrictions are a departure from how the U.S. has handled COVID-19 vaccines until now, reflecting skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials.",
      "Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall.",
      "The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",

And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:18:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The 50% steel and aluminum tariffs could lead to higher prices on everything from cars to home and office supplies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50% today, a move experts say could increase costs on everything from homes and cars to household and office supplies.",
      "While the U.S. has carved out its own niche in domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports from abroad to fill in the gaps: America imported 26.2 million metric tons of steel and 5.4 million metric tons of aluminum\u00a0from abroad last year, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada serves as the biggest foreign source for both metals.",
      "The White House has been aggressively trying to pare back on America's reliance on foreign nations,\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum\u00a0in February, citing\u00a0national security concerns. President Trump, during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill in Pittsburgh on May 30, announced he was\u00a0doubling down on that rate, raising the 25% levies to 50%. The higher tariffs went into effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EST.",
      "While the new tariffs have won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, who saw huge gains in share prices following Mr. Trump's May 30 announcement, experts say the levies will raise cost of manufacturing on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy. That's because businesses typically pass on most or all of tariff-related costs to consumers\u00a0through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"That will hurt the people working in those industries and put their jobs under stress,\" said Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"And it also is going to put pressure on consumers, because those prices are going to increase.\"",
      "While some businesses may ultimately choose to absorb some of those increased costs, experts say others are likely to pass some of them along to customers \u2014 as was the case\u00a0in 2018 when tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs were introduced by the first Trump administration .",
      "Here are some of the consumer products that may get pricier with the new 50% steel and aluminum tariffs now in effect.",
      "Cars",
      "Automobile manufacturers are likely to feel the burn of higher tariffs, as they rely heavily on steel and aluminum for car production. The materials are found throughout the body and structure of a car, in everything from the car's frame to engine parts to the hub caps, pipes and bumpers. According to Jay Cushing, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit, steel accounts for 60% of the weight of the average vehicle.",
      "Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch there is about $800 worth of steel in each vehicle. With that figure in mind, he projected a 50% tariff would drive up the cost of a car by around $400.",
      "Cushing, however, projects an even steeper price hike. \"A doubling of tariffs from 25% to 50% could raise the cost of a car from $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "A 25% tariff on imported cars remains in place, although the Trump administration has\u00a0softened industry tariffs\u00a0to ensure automakers aren't hit twice with the additional import duty on imported steel and aluminum. \"The metal tariffs should apply only once per vehicle,\" Cushing said.",
      "Sports equipment",
      "Athletes may also notice a slight uptick in prices when shopping for new equipment such as baseball bats, tennis rackets and lacrosse sticks which sometimes contain aluminum. Industry experts say they're already seeing price increases on aluminum bats, which are fairly expensive to begin with: upwards of $100 in many cases, with higher-end models running as high as $400.",
      "Those higher price tags could end up creating negative repercussions for sports participation. The Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which tracks industry data, has consistently found that the lowest household income brackets are most negatively impacted in terms of sports participation.",
      "\"If we're going to continue to increase costs on equipment, then those lower income level households are going to continue to be left on the sideline in terms of literally and figuratively,\" said Todd Smith, president and CEO of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.",
      "Beer and soda cans",
      "Whether it be beer, soda or seltzer, any beverages that come in a can will likely cost Americans more after the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect.",
      "This could lead major name-brand businesses to shift their strategy. Back in February, the CEO of Coca-Cola James Quincey said if aluminum cans become more expensive, the company would put more emphasis on plastic bottles. The soda giant sources aluminum for its cans from Canada, Quincey said on a February company earnings call.",
      "Canned goods and packaged grocery items",
      "Another place where Americans might feel a slight pinch is at the grocery store. Nonperishables that come in aluminum or steel cans \u2014 think beans, chickpeas, and soups \u2014 are typically thought of as a way for shoppers to economize. But the steel and aluminum tariffs could ratchet up the price of canned goods.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute,\u00a0told the Associated Press that manufacturers have become increasingly reliant on imported materials in recent years and that it's American families who will most likely bear the increased tariff costs.",
      "Baker, the economist from The Center For Economic and Policy Research, didn't have an exact estimate but said the increase to the cost of canned goods would be fairly low. \"If you get $2 can of soup, maybe it would go up a cent or two,\" he said.",
      "There could be indirect price increases at the grocery store as well. Many packaged goods are made using machines with steel and aluminum machines, Baker said, meaning products like cookies could get more expensive.",
      "Household appliances/supplies",
      "A wide range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners all stand to become pricier as a result of the Trump administration's 50% steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, but has said in the past that they strongly support an \"integrated North American market\" and have\u00a0called for \"common-sense\" trade policies.",
      "\"It can go from the grandiose of a washing machine and a car, to the trivial, like a staple or a paper clip,\" said Winegarden at the Pacific Research Institute.",
      "Lawn mowers could also see price hikes. Baker estimates that a lawn mower that goes for $250mightcost $255 after the tariffs take effect .",
      "\"Will people notice that? Some will, some won't,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt the direction is higher \u2014 the question is how much.\"",
      "Homes",
      "Building materials could also be impacted, which will ultimately translate to higher home prices.",
      "In an April blog post, Realtor.com documented how the price of nails used in homebuilding has already started to increased due to tariffs. A single box of coil roofing nails could go from $65 to $325, the real estate platform predicted at the time.",
      "Other products used in home construction like steel fasteners could also get caught in the crosshairs of the tariffs. This bodes poorly for the housing sector \u2014 which is already facing pressure from high prices, steep mortgage rates and lack of inventory.",
      "\"President Trump's move to double steel and aluminum tariffs will have a negative impact on housing affordability by further disrupting building material supply chains and fueling business uncertainty,\" said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "Before the new 50% tariffs were introduced, the trade association estimated that tariff activity would add roughly $10,900 to the average cost of a new home.",

      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",
      "\"This bill will actually reduce the deficit if you recognize the historical economical growth that has always been there,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday.",

      "Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago.

      "In announcing the Snack Wrap's return, the company included a link to a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, which it describes as a \"content hub for the most anticipated menu item of the decade.\" Featuring Snack Wrap wallpaper as its background, the promotional webpage includes various large folders users can click into. A folder entitled \"Fandom,\" for example, houses screenshots of social media posts from Snack Wrap fans expressing their love for the food and asking when it would be returned to McDonald's menus.",

      "\"I've waited years and I'm getting mildly impatient\" wrote another fan called \"loyal snack wrap lover.\"",
      "Another, more proactive display of loyalty included a Change.org petition to bring back the Snack Wrap. The petition garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. Bringing back the wrap was a \"years-long process,\" Erlinger told The Associated Press.",

This is a departure from the original version, which included a choice of grilled or fried chicken and sauce options like honey mustard and sweet chili.

That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

    "story": [
      "With weather\u00a0forecasts\u00a0showing above-normal temperatures throughout the country this summer, heat-weary Americans will soon likely be turning up their air conditioners for relief. But that comfort will come at a cost.",
      "Home electricity bills\u00a0are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period, according to a recent analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The elevated cost comes as a one-two punch for families already financially strapped after this winter season's higher-than-average heating costs.",
      "Those most impacted by higher summer utility bills will be lower-income households, which often lack the resources to cover monthly payments. About one in four households say they can't pay their energy bills, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey.",
      "The stakes for keeping cool are high. \"Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, resulting in hundreds of fatalities each year,\"\u00a0according to the National Weather Service. Higher temperatures can lead to heat stroke and heat exhaustion.",
      "Heat waves are\u00a0already hitting\u00a0parts of the U.S. like\u00a0Texas. As Mayo Clinic points out, unexpected fluctuations in the temperature often catch people off guard.",
      "For those looking for relief from high temperatures and high bills, experts offer helpful suggestions. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. \"You can do them now, and they pay off.\"",
      "Here are tips to reduce your energy costs as summer heats up.",
      "Low-hanging fruit",
      "As a starting point, Americans can tackle low-hanging fruit options, like using a fan in place of, or in addition to an AC. Fans use far less electricity than air conditioners and are priced more reasonably, whether you're looking for a box fan, a pedestal fan or another model.",
      "For those with ceiling fans there's a hack for staying extra cool. Experts recommend setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise during summer months, as doing so pushes warm air down and keeps a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that as warm air rises, it's circulated throughout the room, said Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project (PULP).",
      "If you use an AC, make sure to change the air filter regularly. Wolfe recommends replacing AC filters monthly during the summer, to help units run more efficiently. For those who plan to keep their unit running during the day, you can set it to a few degrees higher before you leave your home to conserve energy.",
      "Wolfe advises setting your AC temperature between 70\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F when you are at home, and 78\u00b0F when the house is empty.",
      "Other small adjustments to keep your space cool include using indoor plants to create shade, keeping your curtains closed to block out the sunlight during the day, investing in reflective blinds or UV-reflective film for windows. Also, limit your oven use and make sure to turn it off right after using it, as it can warm up your space significantly, said Wolfe.",
      "For general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. Wolfe also recommends running your refrigerator and freezer at the regular temperature as directed by the manufacturer.",
      "\"Running them at cooler temperatures might seem like a good idea in the summer, but that can drive up electricity costs and potentially wear out the electrical appliance,\" he said.",
      "Also, make sure nothing is blocking the airflow of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Plant life or other obstacles in front of vents can make units less efficient, Wolfe noted.",
      "Look to your state or utility company for help",
      "While it may seem counter-intuitive, your utility company may be able to help you bear the cost burden of higher bills.",
      "\"Some utilities run programs to help make your home more energy efficient in the summer,\" said Wolfe. \"They'll offer rebates if you buy more efficient air conditioners, no-cost audits of your home, and they'll subsidize the cost of installing more insulation.\"",
      "In New York, for example, energy giants ConEd and National Grid have monthly discount programs that provide bill credits to low-income households. Wheelock said PULP has seen ConEd customers save $30 to $45 per month on gas an electricity as part of New York's Energy Affordability program, which is administered by the state's major electric and natural gas utilities.",
      "State governments can also be a useful resource. Depending on where you live, your local government may offer free home energy assessments, weatherization assistance or an energy efficiency program designs to help residents lower their electricity bill.",
      "For those struggling to make ends meet, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a\u00a0network\u00a0of state-run programs, provides financial assistance to low-income households.",
      "HEAP provides eligible households, including apartments, with air conditioning units or fans, up to a value of $800, according to WE ACT for Environment Justice, a New York-based environmental justice organization.",
      "\"Anyone at risk of service termination who is low-income should contact their local Department of Social Services to discuss financial assistance programs including Emergency Energy Assistance,\" said Wheelock.",
      "Invest in long-term solutions",
      "With hotter temperatures here to stay, Wolfe said it may be worth investing in more permanent measures like improving your home's insulation or updating your ductwork. This will improve ventilation, keep cold air locked in and make your home more energy efficient overall.",
      "Another option is installing a smart thermostat, which allows you to remotely control the temperature of your space. They can also automatically adjust heating and cooling based on when you're home. Models like Ecobee's Smart Thermostat Essential or Google's Nest Smart Learning Thermostat typically run anywhere from $100 to $200.",
      "These investments may cost more upfront but will save you money over time, says Wolfe. \"In making your home more energy efficient, the savings will pay for the improvements,\" he said.",
      "For those ready to make an even bigger leap, installing a heat pump, switching to central air or upgrading your HVAC or AC system to one with a high Energy Star rating\u00a0are other long-term investments.",
      "Something to keep in mind before you make any of these purchases is whether electricity in your state is high enough to warrant the investment.",
      "\"If you're in like the northeast using heating oil, heat pumps make a lot of sense,\" said Wolfe.",
      "Even before you buy a home, it's worth investigating what the energy bills will look like. You can do this by getting an energy audit from a utility company, said Wolfe.",

      "While the OECD's U.S. forecast didn't mention President Trump by name, the report cited new tariffs as one of the primary causes of the economic slowdown. The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart, those costs are largely passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs \u2014 prompting the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will \"spike in mid-2025\" and reach 3.9% by the end of 2025.",
      "The Consumer Price Index rose by\u00a02.3% in April, as the tariffs largely hadn't yet impacted prices at that point.",
      "Without mentioning Mr. Trump, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",

      "The surge in steel stocks followed an announcement by Mr. Trump on Friday that he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum from the current rate of 25% to 50%. The 25% tariffs,\u00a0announced in February, were enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president authority to restrict imports he deems a national security threat.

      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",

      "May 12 tariff pause",

But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

    "summary": "Higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic in Las Vegas, but casual trips are down.",
    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",

      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping.

      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 16:04:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

    "story": [
      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "Later, in a June 3 order, the judge agreed to pause his decision while the Trump administration pursues an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Citing the stay issued by the Federal Circuit in the other cases, Contreras wrote that similar action in the legal battle before him is \"therefore appropriate to protect the President's ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security.\"",

    "summary": "The New York Times reported that Elon Musk, who served as a senior adviser to President Trump, used the drug ketamine as often as once a day during the 2024 presidential campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The acting top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked President Trump on Wednesday for information about Elon Musk's alleged drug use during the 2024 presidential campaign and whether he was consuming illicit substances while serving as a top adviser to the president in the White House.",
      "Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, the acting ranking member of the panel, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump that he is investigating the extent of Musk's alleged drug use and asked the president to turn over information about what he or other administration officials knew about Musk's supposed consumption while he was working as a special government employee.",
      "Musk, who helped oversee the efforts to overhaul the federal government through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, officially ended his tenure working in the federal government last Friday. But the president said that Musk \"is not really leaving,\" and the billionaire said he would remain a \"friend and adviser\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "As a special government employee, Musk was limited to 130 days in a 365-day period, according to federal law.",
      "\"The drastic and erratic nature of Mr. Musk's decisions and actions as a government employee, coupled with the reports of his drug use, begs the question of whether Mr. Musk was under the influence of illicit substances while working in your White House,\" Lynch wrote. \"The American people deserve to know whether Mr. Musk was under the influence while he gleefully took a 'chainsaw' to our federal government.\"",
      "The letter from the Massachusetts Democrat comes on the heels of a New York Times report published last week that alleged Musk used the drug ketamine as often as once a day during the 2024 campaign. According to the Times, Musk told people he was taking so much ketamine \u2014 which can be used recreationally and for medical purposes \u2014 that it was affecting his bladder.",
      "In addition to ketamine, Musk allegedly took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, the Times reported.",
      "The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX wrote on social media on Saturday that he \"tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago\" adding it \"helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.\" He also accused the Times of \"lying their ass off.\" The Times responded that the newspaper had \"provided Musk with multiple opportunities to reply or rebut this reporting before publication and he declined, opting instead to try to distract with a social post and no evidence.\"",
      "When asked about the claims of chronic drug use during an event with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, Musk rebuffed the question and attacked the Times.",
      "\"The New York Times? Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on the Russiagate?\" Musk asked. \"Let's move on.\"",
      "Musk addressed his ketamine use during an interview with journalist Don Lemon last year and said he was taking a \"small amount once every other week.\" He added that \"if you use too much ketamine, you can't really get work done \u2026 and I have a lot of work.\"",
      "But the Wall Street Journal reported in January 2024 that some executives and board members at his companies became concerned with his use of drugs and the potential consequences for his health and the businesses he oversees.",
      "Musk in February said on social media that he has had a top secret security clearance \"for many years.\" Drug tests to screen for illegal drug use are typically part of the security clearance process, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency.",
      "In his letter to Mr. Trump, Lynch said the president's potential knowledge of any drug use by Musk while he worked in the White House \"deserves scrutiny.\"",
      "\"Given his prominent role in the Trump administration, the American people deserve to know the history and extent of Mr. Musk's drug use and any influence illicit drugs may have had on his efforts to illegally and recklessly dismantle our government,\" he wrote. \"If Mr. Musk is struggling with substance abuse, it is my hope that he gets the assistance and treatment he needs.\"",
      "In addition to seeking information about whether Musk used illegal drugs during his stint in the administration, Lynch also asked whether the billionaire consumed illicit substances on the White House campus or in federal buildings, and what Mr. Trump or his campaign knew about Musk's alleged drug use during the 2024 campaign.",
      "Musk was brought on as a special government employee to help with Mr. Trump's initiative aimed at drastically scaling back the size of the federal government. While working as a senior adviser to the president, Musk attended Cabinet meetings and traveled with the president.",
      "The cost-cutting efforts undertaken by DOGE, which Mr. Trump has said Musk led, included plans to lay off thousands of federal workers, the dismantling of federal agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the termination of federal grants, contracts and leases.",
      "Many of DOGE's actions, as well as Musk's role with the administration, have been challenged in the federal courts. The Supreme Court is weighing a request to allow the administration's sweeping layoffs of federal employees, while a federal district court in Maryland found Musk and DOGE's shutdown of USAID was likely unconstitutional. The Justice Department has appealed that decision.",
      "A federal judge in Washington has also allowed a challenge to Musk's actions to proceed.",

    "summary": "Republicans' sweeping policy bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda would increase annual budget deficits by a total of $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to a new estimate prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",
      "\"This bill will actually reduce the deficit if you recognize the historical economical growth that has always been there,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 05:00:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number to qualify for the Child Tax Credit, a policy shift that would make millions of kids ineligible.",
    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "Mexico will request an exemption from the higher tariff, Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said, arguing that it's unfair because the United States exports more steel to Mexico than it imports. \"It makes no sense to put a tariff on a product in which you have a surplus,\" Ebrard said.",

    "story": [
      "Millions would lose Medicaid coverage. Millions would be left without health insurance. Signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces would be harder and more expensive.",
      "President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that cleared the House in May and now moves to the Senate, could also be called Obamacare Repeal Lite, its critics say. In addition to causing millions of Americans to lose their coverage under Medicaid, the health program for low-income and disabled people, the measure includes the most substantial rollback of the ACA since Mr. Trump's Republican allies tried to pass legislation in 2017 that would have largely repealed President Barack Obama's signature domestic accomplishment.",
      "One difference today is that Republicans aren't describing their legislation as a repeal of the ACA, after the 2017 effort cost them control of the House the following year. Instead, they say the bill would merely reduce \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Medicaid and other government health programs.",
      "\"In a way, this is their ACA repeal wish list without advertising it as Obamacare repeal,\" said Philip Rocco, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University in Milwaukee and co-author of the book \"Obamacare Wars: Federalism, State Politics, and the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "The GOP, Rocco said, learned eight years ago that the \"headline of Obamacare repeal is really bad politics.\"",
      "Democrats have tried to frame Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act as an assault on Americans' health care, just as they did with the 2017 legislation.",
      "\"They are essentially repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said as the House debated the measure in May. \"This bill will destroy the health care system of this country.\"",
      "Nearly two-thirds of adults have a favorable view of the ACA, according to polling by KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "In contrast, about half of people polled also say there are major problems with waste, fraud, and abuse in government health programs, including Medicaid, KFF found.",
      "\"We are not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said May 25 on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" describing the bill's changes as affecting only immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization and \"able-bodied workers\" whom he claimed are on Medicaid but don't work.",
      "The program is \"intended for the most vulnerable populations of Americans, which is pregnant women and young single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,\" he said. \"They are protected in what we're doing because we're preserving the resources for those who need it most.\"",
      "The 2025 legislation wouldn't cut as deeply into health programs as the failed 2017 bill, which would have led to about 32 million Americans losing insurance coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimated\u00a0at the time. By contrast, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with provisions that affect Medicaid and ACA enrollees, would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO.",
      "That number rises to nearly 14 million if Congress doesn't extend premium subsidies for Obamacare plans that were enhanced during the pandemic to help more people buy insurance on government marketplaces, the CBO says. Without congressional action, the more generous subsidies will expire at the end of the year and most ACA enrollees will see their premiums rise sharply.",
      "The increased financial assistance led to a record 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans this year, and health insurance experts predict a large reduction without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Loss of those enhanced subsidies, coupled with other changes set in the House bill, will mean \"the ACA will still be there, but it will be devastating for the program,\" said Katie Keith, founding director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University.",
      "Republicans argue that ACA subsidies are a separate issue from the One Big Beautiful Bill and accused Democrats of conflating them.",
      "The House-passed bill also makes a number of ACA changes, including shortening by a month the annual open enrollment period and eliminating policies from Joe Biden's presidency that allowed many low-income people to sign up year-round.",
      "New paperwork hurdles the House bill creates are also expected to result in people dropping or losing ACA coverage, according to the CBO.",
      "For example, the bill would end most automatic reenrollment, which was used by more than 10 million people this year. Instead, most ACA enrollees would need to provide updated information, including on income and immigration status, to the federal and state ACA marketplaces every year, starting in August, well before open enrollment.",
      "Studies show that additional administrative hurdles lead to people dropping coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "\"Not only do people drop out of the process, but it tends to be healthier, younger, lower-income folks who drop out,\" she said. \"That's dumb because they go uninsured. Also, it is bad for the insurance market.\"",
      "Supporters of the provision say it's necessary to combat fraudulent enrollment by ensuring that ACA beneficiaries still want coverage every year or that they are not being enrolled without their permission by rogue sales agents. Most of the Medicaid coverage reductions in the bill, the CBO says, are due to new work requirements and directives for the 21 million adults added to the program since 2014 under an expansion authorized by the ACA.",
      "One new requirement is that those beneficiaries prove their eligibility every six months, instead of once a year, the norm in most states.",
      "That would add costs for states and probably lead to people who are still eligible falling off Medicaid, said Oregon Medicaid Director Emma Sandoe. Oregon has one of the most liberal continuous eligibility policies, allowing anyone age 6 or older to stay on for up to two years without reapplying.",
      "Such policies help ensure people don't fall off for paperwork reasons and reduce administrative burden for the state, Sandoe said. Requiring more frequent eligibility checks would \"limit the ability of folks to get care and receive health services, and that is our primary goal,\" Sandoe said.",
      "The 2017 repeal effort was aimed at fulfilling Mr. Trump's promises from his first presidential campaign. That's not the case now. The health policy provisions of the House bill instead would help to offset the cost of extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts that skew toward wealthier Americans.",
      "The Medicaid changes in the bill would reduce federal spending on the program by about $700 billion over 10 years. CBO has not yet issued an estimate of how much the ACA provisions would save.",
      "Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said Republican efforts to make it harder for what they term \"able-bodied\" adults to get Medicaid is code for scaling back Obamacare.",
      "The ACA's Medicaid expansion has been adopted by 40 states and Washington, D.C. The House bill's work requirement and added eligibility checks are intended to drive off Medicaid enrollees who Republicans believe never should have been on the program, McBride said. Congress approved the ACA in 2010 with no Republican votes.",
      "Most adult Medicaid enrollees under 65 are already working, studies show. Imposing requirements that people prove they're working, or that they're exempt from having to work, to stay on Medicaid will lead to some people losing coverage simply because they don't fill out paperwork, researchers say.",
      "Manatt Health estimates that about 30% of people added to Medicaid through the ACA expansion would lose coverage, or about 7 million people, said Jocelyn Guyer, senior managing director of the consulting firm.",
      "The bill also would make it harder for people enrolled under Medicaid expansions to get care, because it requires states to charge copayments of up to $35 for some specialist services for those with incomes above the federal poverty level, which is $15,650 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Today, copayments are rare in Medicaid, and when states charge them, they're typically nominal, usually under $10. Studies show cost sharing in Medicaid leads to worse access to care among beneficiaries.",
      "Christopher Pope, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute, acknowledged that some people will lose coverage but rejected the notion that the GOP bill amounts to a full-on assault on the ACA.",
      "He questioned the coverage reductions forecast by the CBO, saying the agency often struggles to accurately predict how states will react to changes in law. He said that some states may make it easy for enrollees to satisfy new work requirements, reducing coverage losses.",
      "By comparison, Pope said, the ACA repeal effort from Mr. Trump's first term a decade ago would have ended the entire Medicaid expansion. \"This bill does nothing to stop the top features of Obamacare,\" Pope said.",
      "But McBride said that while the number of people losing health insurance under the GOP bill is predicted to be less than the 2017 estimates, it would still eliminate about half the ACA's coverage gains, which brought the U.S. uninsured rate to historical lows. \"It would take us backwards,\" he said.",

A federal air marshal was sent to covertly travel near them on a flight on Oct. 18, 2023, one source said.",
      "Sen. Shaheen spoke with Pekoske to ask about the situation regarding her husband. On Oct. 20, 2023, her husband was added to the \"secure flight exclusion list,\" a VIP list that exempts a traveler from the security agency's vetting and surveillance programs, including random screenings.",
      "An order from TSA headquarters was sent to ensure the safeguarded status for William Shaheen was signaled when his future boarding passes were presented at airports.",

      "The person William Shaheen traveled with, whose identity could not be confirmed by CBS News, was removed from the FBI terrorism watchlist later in 2023, sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear why the person was placed on the list, though a host of factors including visits to hostile countries, certain suspicious travel patterns, or contacts with designated terror suspects can all contribute to the listing.",

      "\"Even with the safety net cuts, the House bill leads to public debt rising by over $3 trillion in coming years (and over $5 trillion over the next decade if provisions are made permanent rather than phasing out),\" the economists state. \"The higher debt and deficits will put noticeable upward pressure on both inflation and interest rates in coming years.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "A proposal by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would amount to an indefinite pause on the U.S. government's decades-old policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work in the country lawfully while their cases are decided, the DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "The proposed changes \u2014 which have not been previously reported \u2014 would add yet another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system that his top aides have argued is being systematically exploited by economic migrants.",
      "But a halt to work permits for asylum-seekers would also trigger concerns among advocates that it could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy.",
      "Since the 1990s, U.S. law has allowed immigration officials to grant work permits to asylum applicants if their cases have been pending for at least 180 days. Generally speaking, that has allowed asylum applicants to request a work permit 150 days after they make their claim. Those eligible can be granted the permit after another 30 days.",
      "But a regulation under internal consideration by the Trump administration would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, the DHS officials said.",
      "That timeframe would be exceedingly difficult to meet in the near future, given massive case backlogs and operational constraints. Last year, for example, a federal government watchdog found that over 77% of the asylum applications before USCIS had been pending for beyond 180 days. Nearly 40% of applications remained unresolved after two years.",
      "Even if the 180-day processing average is reached, the proposal would require asylum-seekers to wait one year until after they file their application \u2014 instead of six months \u2014 to be eligible for a work permit, the DHS officials said.",
      "It's unclear when the regulation may be publicly announced, or if it will be altered before being finalized.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on the \"deliberative process or possible decision making.\"",
      "\"Over the previous four years, the Biden administration eviscerated the integrity of America's asylum system. The Department is exploring all possible options to protect our national security and increase program integrity,\" DHS said in its statement. \"DHS is working to mitigate all forms of fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The changes under consideration by the Trump administration would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts, which are overseen by the Justice Department.",
      "Asylum can be granted to foreigners on U.S. soil who prove they are fleeing persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. While factors like nationality and legal representation play a key role, many applicants do not ultimately meet the high legal threshold to win asylum, government figures show.",
      "Still, over the past decade, amid record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of asylum applications has ballooned. USCIS is overseeing roughly 1.5 million asylum applications, while the immigration courts are reviewing another 2 million, according to government data.",
      "The plan under consideration would seek to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S. It echoes a 2020 rule issued by the first Trump administration that sought to increase the waiting period for asylum applicants requesting work authorization from six months to a year and impose other restrictions on eligibility for work permits.",
      "The proposed rule would also be the latest step taken by the second Trump administration to make the U.S. inhospitable for asylum-seekers.",
      "Immediately after returning to the White House in January, President Trump all but closed the U.S. asylum system, giving border agents the power to summarily deport most migrants on the grounds the country is facing an \"invasion.\" That emergency order is being challenged by pro-immigrant advocates, who say it ignores American asylum law.",
      "Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group that supports those with asylum claims, said efforts to curtail work permits for the migrants she serves would hurt U.S. communities and employers.",

While the documents do not say what the ship's new name would be, the proposal comes during Pride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969. WorldPride celebrations are being held in Washington, D.C., this year.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News also show other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming \"recommended list.\"",

      "\"The reported decision by the Trump Administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream,\" Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi told CBS News in a statement.",
      "She added, \"Our military is the most powerful in the world \u2013 but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News the move was \"an utter abomination in terms of the extreme MAGA Republican effort to continue to erase American history, and we're not going to allow it to happen.\" And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X that Hegseth \"should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.\"",
      "Following his confirmation in January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a\u00a0directive instructing the Pentagon and U.S. military services to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, citing concerns that such programs could undermine unity within the ranks. The \"Identity Months Dead at DoD\" guidance banned official manpower and resources from being used on such events \u2014 among them, Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News were not marked with the traditional classification markers typically seen on Defense Department memos. The documents were not marked as \"For Official Use Only\" or \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" they were also not marked to indicate they were drafts. There was a \"CAUTION\" note, however, referring to the information as publicly sensitive.",
      "The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of \"reestablishing the warrior culture.\"",
      "The documents call for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, with the notice of the name change going out to other senior U.S. Navy officials later in the week after undergoing legal review.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.\" Parnell added that any potential renaming decisions would be announced once the internal reviews are complete. Military.com first reported the name change for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, but the news of other naval vessels being considered for a name change has not yet been reported.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk is a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, designed to support carrier strike groups at sea. The class of ships is named after civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, who died in 2020.",
      "Harvey Milk, the political trailblazer, emerged in the 1970s as one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After years of activism, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, where he quickly became a national symbol of LGBTQ+ political empowerment. His life was cut short in 1978 when he was assassinated in City Hall, alongside Mayor George Moscone.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces.",
      "Before he emerged as one of the most visible advocates for gay rights in American history, Milk served in the U.S. Navy. From 1952 to 1954, he held posts as an operations and dive officer aboard two submarine rescue ships \u2014 the USS Chanticleer and the USS Kittiwake \u2014 both active during the Korean War, according to the U.S. National Archives.",
      "But his sexual orientation carried profound consequences as Milk came under scrutiny. In December 1954, Milk, who was then a lieutenant junior grade, was facing a court martial for participating in a \"homosexual act\" a year earlier.",
      "Instead of facing trial, Milk was drummed out of the U.S. military, like so many other gay service members of his era. In January 1954, he resigned his commission and accepted an \"Other Than Honorable\" discharge. In 2021, the Navy approached Milk's nephew, Stuart Milk, to see if he wanted his uncle's discharge upgraded, according to NPR. Stuart decided against it as a reminder that not everyone was treated with honor.",
      "The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy. In February, he directed Fort Liberty in North Carolina return to Fort Bragg, saying it would now be named after a non-Confederate Bragg, and then directed Fort Moore change to Fort Benning, after another Benning.",
      "The naming commission also suggested the Navy rename the guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville, which honors a Confederate battle victory, to the USS Robert Smalls, to recognize a slave who stole a Confederate ship and surrendered it to the Union. The Navy also renamed the USNS Maury to the USNS Marie Tharp, removing the name of a Confederate sailor and replacing it with the name of a pioneering female oceanographer.",

    "summary": "Days after a transgender high school athlete won two California track events, the Trump administration is threatening legal action.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is threatening California with steep fines and legal action days after a transgender athlete won two statewide high school track-and-field events, ramping up the legal threats aimed at the state over transgender issues.",
      "The student, AB Hernandez, a transgender 16-year-old, won both the high school girls' high jump and triple jump at a California state track meet on Saturday, after competing under new rules that allowed more girls to compete and medal in events in which Hernandez participated.",
      "Before the competition, California Interscholastic Foundation, the independent non-profit organization that runs the state's high school sports, started a \"pilot entry process\" that allowed additional female students to participate in the championship meet. The new rules also resulted in Hernandez sharing the gold medal podium with two other students in a shared first place win in one event. The new policy only applied to events that Hernandez participated in.",
      "However, in a letter sent Monday to California public school districts and the CIF, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, called CIF policies allowing transgender athletes to compete \"unconstitutional.\" She alleged that \"knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause\" of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Dhillon ordered the CIF to inform the Justice Department by June 9 that it will no longer implement a bylaw covering transgender athletes, alleging it violates the rights of female athletes.",
      "The CIF rule criticized by Dhillon's letter requires California public high schools to allow all students to participate in sports \"in a manner that is consistent with their gender identities, irrespective of the gender listed on a student's records.\"",
      "The letter does not mention Hernandez. But on Tuesday morning, President Trump singled out Hernandez in a\u00a0post on Truth Social, his social media site, and said that \"large scale fines\" will be imposed on the state.",
      "Last week, Bill Essayli, the acting top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California, also said he was launching an investigation into the foundation.",
      "In an interview with the news outlet Capital & Main, Hernandez said that she is not worried about the criticism, both national and local, aimed at her.",
      "\"I'm still a child, you're an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\" Hernandez told the publication.",
      "A spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta said that the office is \"reviewing the letter and closely monitoring the Trump Administration's actions in this space.\"",
      "\"We're very concerned with the Trump Administration's ongoing threats to California schools and remain committed to defending and upholding California laws and all additional laws which ensure the rights of students \u2014 including transgender students \u2014 to be free from discrimination and harassment,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for the CIF did not respond to immediate requests for comment.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department announced that it was investigating California high school sports after it allowed the student to compete at the track and field championships. The Trump administration has already sued Maine over what it alleges is a violation of an executive order attempting to ban transgender women and girls from women's sports.",
      "Earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to California warning of legal action if the state does not follow federal civil rights laws following Mr. Trump's executive order in February opposing transgender athletes.",

    "summary": "It's the latest criticism from the Trump adviser toward the sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing the president's domestic priorities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Tuesday, calling it \"a disgusting abomination\" as Congress rushes to send the legislation to the president by July 4.",
      "\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk wrote in a post on X, adding that the sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's domestic priorities is \"outrageous\" and \"pork-filled.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said. Hours later, he warned, \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the criticism during the daily press briefing, telling reporters that Mr. Trump \"already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion.\"",
      "Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview that he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the measure, which passed the House before Memorial Day after Mr. Trump stepped up pressure on the Republican holdouts to fall in line. Musk said the package increases the deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\"",
      "Some Republican senators were quick to chime in Tuesday and back Musk's sentiment. The package is now in the hands of the Senate and is expected to undergo changes before heading back to the House.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes the House-passed legislation over the debt ceiling increase, urged the president to \"take some advice from Elon.\" Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who also wants a number of changes to the bill, told reporters he shared Musk's concerns.",
      "\"The Senate must make this bill better,\" added Sen. Mike Lee of Utah.",
      "But Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said he has a \"difference of opinion\" with Musk and the billionaire is \"entitled to his opinion.\"",
      "\"My hope is that as he has an opportunity to further assess what this bill actually does that he'll come to a different conclusion,\" Thune said.",
      "GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia noted that it was Mr. Trump who was elected, not Musk.",
      "\"I stand with the president, and that's all there is to it,\" Justice said.",
      "Senate Republicans were gathered for their weekly lunch when Musk posted his criticism. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said the general reaction in the room to the message was \"eyeball roll.\"",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, appeared to take offense to Musk's remark.",
      "\"I just deeply regret that he's made this mistake,\" Johnson said, suggesting that Musk's criticism is related to cuts to tax credits aimed at incentivizing electric vehicle purchases. \"I know that the EV mandate is very important to him. That is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things ... and I know that has an effect on his business.\"",
      "\"For him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing, very surprising, in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday,\" Johnson said.",
      "Last Wednesday, Musk announced his departure as a \"special government employee,\" a designation that allowed him to work for the administration under different ethics rules than federal employees and limited his work to 130 days.",
      "Musk vowed to slash $1 trillion from the federal budget but left the Trump administration falling far short of that goal. Nonetheless, DOGE's cuts to the government workforce, dismantling of agencies and cancelation in billions of grants and contracts sent shock waves through Washington that reverberated across the country and abroad.",
      "A senior administration official told CBS News last week that the billionaire entrepreneur \"left on good terms and is still friends with the president.\"",
      "\"This isn't a separation, but just a return to the private sector for Musk,\" the official said, adding that Musk will continue to advise the president.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:35:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The package would cancel $9.4 billion in funding that Congress previously appropriated for NPR, PBS and USAID.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Tuesday sent a formal request to Congress to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously approved.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, aiming to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. It focuses on slashing foreign aid, along with major public broadcasting entities, including NPR and PBS.",
      "The $9.4 billion rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. In April, the White House released a statement saying taxpayers had funded the two entities \"for too long\" and said they've \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "The package also requests $8.3 billion in cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The foreign aid agency became a target of the administration, which worked to shutter it earlier this year. And Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought has argued that the foreign aid is not only wasteful, but that USAID has been pushing \"weaponized cultural indoctrination\" in other countries.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The rescission process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated. And only discretionary funds can be rescinded, while mandatory spending, like Social Security and Medicare, cannot be.",
      "In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber. Instead, they only require a simple majority.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget's rescission request kickstarts a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. First, the request goes before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes.",
      "Republicans in Congress have been eager to get started on the rescission process, as deficit hawks rail against Washington's spending habits. And House Speaker Mike Johnson has pledged the House will \"act quickly by passing legislation to codify the cuts.\"",
      "\"The House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand,\" Johnson said last week in a post on X.",
      "But whether Republican leaders can successfully maneuver the package through Congress remains to be seen. While rescission has frequently been used in Congress to reallocate unspent funds, requests from the White House come less frequently. And during the first Trump administration, the Senate rejected a rescission package sent by the White House requesting nearly $15 billion in cuts.",
      "Meanwhile, fiscal hawks in Congress have been advocating for rescission to cut down on costs while a major legislative package key to Mr. Trump's agenda makes its way through Congress. That legislation, titled One Big Beautiful Bill, would allocate funding for tax cuts, border security and defense. But the price tag for that package, which at this point could add around $3 trillion to the national debt, dwarfs what lawmakers would get back from the rescission package.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been a vocal opponent of additional spending and especially a plan to raise the debt ceiling as part of the tax cut legislation, backs the rescission package, calling the funds \"the low-hanging fruit.\" But he, too, noted that the impact on the deficit would be minuscule.",
      "\"This is very, very small,\" Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"It really doesn't materially change the course of the country.\"",

    "summary": "Three transgender inmates sued the Trump administration after President Trump issued an executive order that sought to restrict their access to gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled Tuesday that the federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they pursue a legal challenge to President Trump's executive order that sought to restrict access to the treatments.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and were provided with hormone therapy and certain lifestyle accommodations, such as clothing and hair removal devices, during their incarceration.",
      "The inmates filed their lawsuit after Mr. Trump issued an executive order on his first day back in the White House that kept federal funds from being spent on any medical procedure or treatment meant to confirm an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.",
      "They asked the district court in Washington to block implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while their lawsuit proceeds, arguing that the directive and the Bureau of Prison's actions implementing it violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process, the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Lamberth agreed, and ruled that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The judge blocked administration officials from enforcing the president's executive order as it relates to hormone therapy and social accommodations for people in custody of the Bureau of Prisons and directed them to continue providing transgender inmates with gender-affirming care and certain accommodations, as was the bureau's policy before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The import of the opinion is essentially this: Under the APA, the BOP may not arbitrarily deprive inmates of medications or other lifestyle accommodations that its own medical staff have deemed to be medically appropriate without considering the implications of that decision,\" Lamberth, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote in a 36-page opinion.",
      "The case before Lamberth is one of several brought by transgender inmates in response to Mr. Trump's executive actions. In the wake of the president's order regarding gender-affirming care for inmates, the Bureau of Prisons issued memoranda that barred federal dollars from being used to \"purchase any items that align with transgender ideology\" or provide gender-affirming care for transgender inmates. The bureau also clarified that requests for clothing accommodations will be denied.",
      "The three plaintiffs in the case were in custody of the Bureau of Prisons when the directives were issued and filed their lawsuit in March. They had been prescribed hormone therapy and were approved to receive social accommodations, including undergarments and hygiene products. But on the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, they were informed their treatments would be discontinued, though their access to the medical care has since been restored.",
      "The transgender inmates asked the court to issue relief in mid-March and sought to certify a class consisting of all incarcerated people in the Bureau of Prisons' custody who will be or have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and receive the gender-affirming care targeted by Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Lamberth rejected the Trump administration's contention that it will suffer a financial burden if required to continue providing certain gender-affirming care to inmates. He noted that the Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to 600 incarcerated people who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"The only deleterious public effect of the court's injunction will be to require that, during the pendency of litigation, the BOP will continue to shoulder a certain administrative cost that it has already willingly assumed since the commencement of this action, and that it had voluntary borne for many years prior,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge also said that neither the Bureau of Prisons nor Mr. Trump's executive order provided a \"serious explanation\" as to why medical treatment for gender dysphoria should be handled differently than other mental health interventions.",
      "\"Nothing in the thin record before the court suggests that either the BOP or the president consciously took stock of \u2014 much less studied \u2014 the potentially debilitating effects that the new policies could have on transgender inmates before the implementing memoranda came into force,\" Lamberth found.",
      "The Justice Department is likely to appeal the decision. It is the latest in a slew of rulings from trial court judges that have blocked many aspects of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked Trump's 10% tariff assessed on nearly every U.S. trading partner and duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "Later, in a June 3 order, the judge agreed to pause his decision while the Trump administration pursues an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Citing the stay issued by the Federal Circuit in the other cases, Contreras wrote that similar action in the legal battle before him is \"therefore appropriate to protect the President's ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security.\"",

      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",

      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",

      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",

      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker - including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

    "summary": "If you're seeing a thick haze outside your window, it's likely air pollution. Here's how to find out what the air quality is near you.",
    "story": [
      "Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., prompting air quality alerts for Americans as it continues to spread.",
      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50",

      "Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150",
      "Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200",
      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",

      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",
      "But what is in our \"backyard\" still largely remains unknown, he added.",
      "Cheng made the discovery alongside colleagues Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, and Li said the newly found object demonstrates the power of open science.",
      "\"All the data we used to identify and characterize this object are archival data that are available to anyone, not only professional astronomers,\" Li said in a statement. \"This means that groundbreaking discoveries aren't limited to those with access to the world's largest telescopes. Any researcher, student, or even citizen scientist with the right tools and knowledge could have made this discovery, highlighting the value of sharing scientific resources.\"",

      "Scientists have unlocked one of the solar system's many secrets from an unexpected source: a planetarium show.",
      "At the American Museum of Natural History last fall, experts were hard at work preparing \"Encounters in the Milky Way,\" a deep dive into our home galaxy shaped by the movements of stars and other celestial objects.",
      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker - including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" -- narrated by actor Pedro Pascal -- is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",

I've been traveling, thanks to the gods, all my life, this was like the cherry on top of a cake. I mean, to go up in space and see how huge it is,  you can only begin to imagine how much more there is still to discover.\"",

    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",
      "When the researchers modeled its orbit, they found it did not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. This could pose a problem for the Planet Nine theory, but Cheng emphasized more data is needed.",
      "Samantha Lawler of Canada's University of Regina told AFP that this \"great discovery\" and others like it mean that \"the original argument for Planet Nine is getting weaker and weaker.\"",
      "The Vera Rubin Observatory, which is scheduled to go online in Chile this year, is expected to shed light on this mystery, one way or another.",
      "Deen said it was discouraging that no sign of Planet Nine has been found so far, but with Vera Rubin \"on the horizon I don't think we'll have to wonder about its existence for much longer.\"",
      "For Cheng, he still hopes that this huge planet is out there somewhere.",
      "\"We're in an era when big telescopes can see almost to the edge of the universe,\" he said.",
      "But what is in our \"backyard\" still largely remains unknown, he added.",
      "Cheng made the discovery alongside colleagues Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, and Li said the newly found object demonstrates the power of open science.",
      "\"All the data we used to identify and characterize this object are archival data that are available to anyone, not only professional astronomers,\" Li said in a statement. \"This means that groundbreaking discoveries aren't limited to those with access to the world's largest telescopes. Any researcher, student, or even citizen scientist with the right tools and knowledge could have made this discovery, highlighting the value of sharing scientific resources.\"",

    "summary": "The 50% steel and aluminum tariffs could lead to higher prices on everything from cars to home and office supplies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50% today, a move experts say could increase costs on everything from homes and cars to household and office supplies.",
      "While the U.S. has carved out its own niche in domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports from abroad to fill in the gaps: America imported 26.2 million metric tons of steel and 5.4 million metric tons of aluminum\u00a0from abroad last year, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada serves as the biggest foreign source for both metals.",
      "The White House has been aggressively trying to pare back on America's reliance on foreign nations,\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum\u00a0in February, citing\u00a0national security concerns. President Trump, during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill in Pittsburgh on May 30, announced he was\u00a0doubling down on that rate, raising the 25% levies to 50%. The higher tariffs went into effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EST.",
      "While the new tariffs have won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, who saw huge gains in share prices following Mr. Trump's May 30 announcement, experts say the levies will raise cost of manufacturing on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy. That's because businesses typically pass on most or all of tariff-related costs to consumers\u00a0through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"That will hurt the people working in those industries and put their jobs under stress,\" said Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"And it also is going to put pressure on consumers, because those prices are going to increase.\"",
      "While some businesses may ultimately choose to absorb some of those increased costs, experts say others are likely to pass some of them along to customers \u2014 as was the case\u00a0in 2018 when tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs were introduced by the first Trump administration .",
      "Here are some of the consumer products that may get pricier with the new 50% steel and aluminum tariffs now in effect.",
      "Cars",
      "Automobile manufacturers are likely to feel the burn of higher tariffs, as they rely heavily on steel and aluminum for car production. The materials are found throughout the body and structure of a car, in everything from the car's frame to engine parts to the hub caps, pipes and bumpers. According to Jay Cushing, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit, steel accounts for 60% of the weight of the average vehicle.",
      "Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch there is about $800 worth of steel in each vehicle. With that figure in mind, he projected a 50% tariff would drive up the cost of a car by around $400.",
      "Cushing, however, projects an even steeper price hike. \"A doubling of tariffs from 25% to 50% could raise the cost of a car from $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "A 25% tariff on imported cars remains in place, although the Trump administration has\u00a0softened industry tariffs\u00a0to ensure automakers aren't hit twice with the additional import duty on imported steel and aluminum. \"The metal tariffs should apply only once per vehicle,\" Cushing said.",
      "Sports equipment",
      "Athletes may also notice a slight uptick in prices when shopping for new equipment such as baseball bats, tennis rackets and lacrosse sticks which sometimes contain aluminum. Industry experts say they're already seeing price increases on aluminum bats, which are fairly expensive to begin with: upwards of $100 in many cases, with higher-end models running as high as $400.",
      "Those higher price tags could end up creating negative repercussions for sports participation. The Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which tracks industry data, has consistently found that the lowest household income brackets are most negatively impacted in terms of sports participation.",
      "\"If we're going to continue to increase costs on equipment, then those lower income level households are going to continue to be left on the sideline in terms of literally and figuratively,\" said Todd Smith, president and CEO of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.",
      "Beer and soda cans",
      "Whether it be beer, soda or seltzer, any beverages that come in a can will likely cost Americans more after the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect.",
      "This could lead major name-brand businesses to shift their strategy. Back in February, the CEO of Coca-Cola James Quincey said if aluminum cans become more expensive, the company would put more emphasis on plastic bottles. The soda giant sources aluminum for its cans from Canada, Quincey said on a February company earnings call.",
      "Canned goods and packaged grocery items",
      "Another place where Americans might feel a slight pinch is at the grocery store. Nonperishables that come in aluminum or steel cans \u2014 think beans, chickpeas, and soups \u2014 are typically thought of as a way for shoppers to economize. But the steel and aluminum tariffs could ratchet up the price of canned goods.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute,\u00a0told the Associated Press that manufacturers have become increasingly reliant on imported materials in recent years and that it's American families who will most likely bear the increased tariff costs.",
      "Baker, the economist from The Center For Economic and Policy Research, didn't have an exact estimate but said the increase to the cost of canned goods would be fairly low. \"If you get $2 can of soup, maybe it would go up a cent or two,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Dana Chandler, 65, was sentenced to life in prison for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband Mike Sisco and his girlfriend Karen Harkness on June 3, 2025.",
      "Judge Cheryl Rios handed down two consecutive life terms and Chandler will not be eligible for parole for 50 years, with credit for about 13 years of time she has already served.",
      "Hailey Seel, Chandler and Sisco's daughter, gave a victim impact statement at sentencing. According to The Kansas Reflector, Seel said about her mother in court, \"I truly see her now as the evil killer. I hate it. I don't want to call you evil killer, but I can't live in a fairy tale.\"",
      "Seel reportedly recommended the judge to show mercy on Chandler if she confessed to the crime and expressed remorse. But if Chandler continued to deny her involvement, Seel recommended the judge should impose the maximum sentence.",
      "The Kansas Reflector reported Chandler continued to deny involvement in the crimes, stating, \"I have always maintained my innocence. I continue to maintain my innocence. I was not in Topeka, Kansas, on July 7. I never owned or possessed a 9-millimeter firearm. What is happening in this courtroom is a grave injustice. I was not the one who killed them.\"",
      "Sisco, 47, and Harkness, 53, were each shot multiple times with a 9mm gun on July 7, 2002, in Harkness' Topeka, Kansas, home. Police quickly suspected Chandler after members of the Harkness and Sisco families said she harassed Sisco with bizarre visits and frequent phone calls following their bitter divorce and custody battle. She was questioned by police but was not charged. Chandler has always maintained her innocence.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has been covering the case since 2008, and most recently in \"My Mother's Murder Trials\" reported by contributor Jim Axelrod.",
      "For years, the couple's families met with law enforcement and even conducted their own investigation looking for additional evidence, such as the murder weapon, which was never found. At that time, Shawnee County District Attorney Robert Hecht reportedly said there was not enough evidence to charge Chandler. In 2011, a new DA, Chad Taylor, was in office and made the decision to move the case forward.",
      "Dana Chandler was arrested in 2011 and entered not guilty pleas to two counts of first-degree murder. A jury convicted Chandler in 2012, and she was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Six years later, Chandler's convictions were overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled that statements made at Chandler's trial by prosecutor Jacqie Spradling was, in at least one instance, \"made-up\" and \"misleading.\" Spradling was later disbarred for what the court called \"intolerable acts of deception\" aimed at the jury and the courts. \"48 Hours\" reached out to Spradling, but did not receive a response.",
      "But the Kansas Supreme Court did not dismiss Chandler's case. It ruled that there was still sufficient evidence for a jury to find Chandler guilty. The decision whether to retry Chandler was up to the new Shawnee County DA Mike Kagay, and he chose to proceed with another trial.",
      "Chandler's second trial began in July 2022. Defense attorney Tom Bath argued there was no DNA, fingerprint or hair evidence that placed Chandler inside the Harkness residence, or even in the state of Kansas.",
      "Shawnee County Deputy DA Charles Kitt acknowledged the lack of physical evidence and told the jury the case was instead based on jealousy, rage and obsession.",
      "The jury in this trial was unable to reach a unanimous decision. After six days of deliberation, the judge announced a hung jury, reportedly with seven votes to convict and five to acquit.",
      "Following the hung jury, the judge reduced Chandler's bond, and after being incarcerated for more than a decade, she was released from jail with GPS monitoring. The defense also requested a change of venue for the upcoming trial, which the judge granted.",
      "Chandler's third trial got underway in February 2025, in Pottawatomie County, 60 miles from Topeka. On the morning of opening statements, Chandler dismissed her attorneys and announced she would represent herself.",
      "At trial, Chandler's children, Hailey Seel and Dustin Sisco \u2014 who were teenagers at the time of the murders \u2014 testified for the prosecution, as they had done previously. They both believe their mother, Dana Chandler, is responsible for murdering their father, Mike Sisco, and Karen Harkness. They were also questioned by their mother.",
      "When it was time to present her case, Chandler testified for approximately 20 hours, spread over seven days. She argued that no one could place her at the scene of the murders, or even in the state of Kansas at the time of the killings, and that she had never owned or possessed a .9mm firearm.",
      "Deputy DA Kitt focused on Chandler's obsessive behavior and told the jury she killed Sisco and Harkness because she had lost control of her ex-husband.",
      "The jury deliberated nearly four hours before finding Chandler guilty.",
      "Hailey Seel says she was relieved by the verdict but hopes that the lives lost are not forgotten.",
      "\"I do feel like the focus of this case has gone almost completely to Dana Chandler and that the \u2014 the victims and the families of the victims has really been lost in this case, which is really sad. And I hope that from here out the \u2014 the victims and the families can be remembered more,\" Seel told \"48 Hours.\"",

      "Police in Palm Springs said the bomber backed his Ford Fusion into a parking spot outside the clinic before the powerful explosion left a crater on the morning of May 17. The explosion could be felt more than a mile away from the blast zone, the FBI said.",
      "The vehicle exploded outside American Reproductive Centers, a fertility clinic with a full-service IVF lab that dd not perform abortions. The blast caused significant damage to the building. The facility also lost power, but it was restored in time so no embryos were lost in the attack. The clinic reopened about two weeks later at a new location.",
      "The FBI believed that the bombing was premeditated and called the attack an \"intentional act of terrorism.\"",
      "Detectives said they believed Bartkus acted alone at the site of the attack, but said they were scouring his online chats to learn whether anyone helped him buy parts or refine the design of the bomb.",
      "Investigators said the blast pattern shows that the device was far more damaging than a low-grade explosive such as fireworks.",
      "The FBI said Bartkus had access to a large quantity of commercially available chemical products that could be combined to create a homemade explosive device.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda would increase annual budget deficits by a total of $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to a new estimate prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",

McCook, 23, of Georgetown, Texas, was a member of the 22nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium), 341st Bombardment Group (Medium), 10th Air Force during World War II, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Before joining the military, McCook had graduated from Southwestern University and came from a family of pilots, according to local newspaper clippings gathered by the DPAA.",
      "McCook, nicknamed \"Woody,\" served in China and Burma, according to newspaper clippings. He was one of 20 officers and enlisted men credited for a mission that air-dropped supplies to Allied forces battling Japanese troops in northern Burma. During his service, McCook received the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "On August 3, 1943, McCook was the armor-gunner on the B-25C \"Mitchell,\" conducting a low-altitude bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, the DPAA said. The raid was meant to target the Meiktila dam and nearby Japanese barracks, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "The aircraft crashed during the mission. McCook and three others aboard the plane died, but two men survived. One of the survivors, identified in newspaper clippings as Sgt. John Boyd, said the plane had been hit by an explosive gas shell while flying at a low altitude. McCook, who Boyd recalled \"as the best in the business,\" was able to bring the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed Boyd and the other surviving soldier to parachute from the craft before it crashed.",
      "Boyd said this action allowed him to survive. He and the other soldier were taken captive by Japanese forces, the DPAA said. Boyd spent two years as a prisoner in Rangoon before he was freed, according to newspaper clippings.",

      "Locals said the four sets of remains, designated X-282A-D, were from an \"American crash,\" the DPAA said. But the remains were not identified at the time. They were interred as \"Unknowns\" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, or the Punchbowl, in Honolulu, Hawaii. McCook's name was listed on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In January 2022, the DPAA disinterred all four sets of remains and taken to the agency's laboratory. Dental, anthropological and isotope analyses were conducted. Other military agencies used mitochondrial DNA analysis and genome sequencing data to help identify the remains. The processes allowed the DPAA to identify one of the sets of remains as belonging to McCook.",

      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "The official investigation, though, seemed stalled, so authorities asked Vernon Geberth, a homicide and forensic consultant and former New York City Police Department detective, to review case files. In 2007, nearly five years after the murders, he issued a report concluding \"\u2026 Dana Chandler is the one and only person who had the motive, means and opportunity to commit these murders.\"",

      "But to authorities, there was the question about exactly where Chandler was during that time. Volle says she told him she was home Saturday, the night of the murders and then drove through the mountains the next day. But Chandler's business acquaintance Jeff Bailey, testified Chandler told him something different \u2014 that she slept in her car in the mountains the Saturday night of the murders.",
      "JEFF BAILEY (in court): She told me that the story she was giving me was the truth. And the story that she'd given to the law enforcements was not the truth.",
      "And prosecutors told the jury Chandler did not use her cellphone for 27 hours the weekend of the murders. Remember, Hailey Seel accused her mother of trying to avoid being tracked. Volle found another instance when Chandler didn't use her phone a month before the murders.",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): There were no calls registered. There were some calls came to the phone, but none were picked up.   And prosecutors say that's important, because during that time \u2014 a month before the murders \u2014 was Chandler's dry run for the killings. They called her friend Ann Carrender to the stand. Carrender says Dana told her she had driven to Topeka.",
      "ANN CARRENDER (in court): She had\u2014 gone to Mike's house\u2014 through the window. Um, nobody was home. \u2026",

      "ANN CARRENDER: That she had gone \u2014 and sat outside Karen's house.",
      "Spradling says Chandler was obsessed with Mike Sisco and presented evidence that in the six months leading up to the murders, she called Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness more than 600 times. The defense argued Chandler was calling to talk to her kids, but Hailey Seel remembered her mother's calls differently.",
      "JACQIE SPRADLING (in court): What was the thing that she talked to you the most about?",
      "HAILEY SEEL: \u00a0She talked about my dad a lot. And \u2013 I \u2014 I re \u2014 I really feel like she was \u2014 was really just obsessed \u2014 with him.",

      "HAILEY SEEL: I think that she \u2014 was \u2014 was thinking there was \u2014 a lady in there with my dad.",
      "Hailey also testified about those recordings she made talking with her mother. During one of them, Chandler, who attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, gave an explanation as to why she bought those gas cans.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (audio recording): I ran into a girl that had run out of gas at an AA meeting and so I went and got gas for her. She asked me for money and we don't give people money at AA \u2026",
      "Prosecutor Spradling told the jury that she believed Chandler used those two five-gallon gas cans to have enough gas so she would not have to stop and potentially be seen near the crime scene. But Chandler's attorney argued there was no proof she was ever in Topeka during the time of the murders.",
      "MARK BENNETT (in court): Did you or \u2026 any other members of the Topeka Police Department \u2026 ever find an eyewitness that put \u2014 the defendant, Dana Chandler, in Topeka, Kansas on either July 6 or July 7, 2002?",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE: No.",
      "The closest law enforcement was able to come was at a gas station in WaKeeney, Kansas, nearly halfway between Denver and Topeka. Clerk Patty Williams wasn't sure, but she thought she might have seen Chandler the night of the murders.",
      "Jacqie Spradling: Patty was shown a picture of the defendant \u2026 Patty indicated that she was 70% sure that that was the woman who had been there.",
      "But by the time Chandler went on trial, Patty Williams had died. A different worker from the gas station testified about seeing a black car that looked similar to the one Chandler drove that day. But she said it might have had license plates from Virginia. When it was the defense's turn, Bennett pointed out there was no proof Chandler was ever there.",
      "MARK BENNETT (in court): Wasn't any receipt from WaKeeney, was there?",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE: No.",
      "And Bennett questioned whether Volle investigated other suspects, like two men with criminal records who had stolen checks from Mike Sisco and cashed one after the murders.",
      "MARK BENNETT (in court): That didn't make 'em a suspect?",

      "Hailey Seel: I'm scared to death that she's going to hurt me, or she's going to affect my kids in some way.",
      "Hailey's fear only grew when Chandler made a post to her Facebook page. Chandler complained about her treatment at trial, calling it a kangaroo court. And in the background, she showed images of Hailey's children. Hailey says Chandler somehow learned which church she attended and downloaded a livestream of a service to create the photos.",
      "Hailey Seel: It was chilling and it was disturbing. \u2026 I feel like it was a direct message to me.",

      "Hailey Seel: She's my mom but \u2026 if you're my mom, why would you do that to my dad? \u2026 For your kids' sake, maybe that would be a reason not to do it. \u2026 Being a mother now, I have a new perspective. \u2026 It becomes even more unreal now.",

      "Hailey Seel: This time, I am not as confident.",
      "For trial number three, jurors would be from Pottawatomie County, Kansas. The defense requested a change of venue, and the judge agreed, citing excessive media coverage. It would take place in Westmoreland, a smaller, more rural area, 60 miles away from the last setting in Topeka.",

      "One thing that was the same as in the previous trials: Hailey Seel testifying.",
      "Hailey was asked again by the prosecution about her mother's inappropriate behavior.",
      "DAN DUNBAR (in court): What sort of things would she say about Karen?",

      "Chandler challenged Hailey about her description of that drop-off at Harkness' home. Chandler said it was Hailey's father, Mike Sisco, who was behaving badly, not her.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): When your dad and Karen drove up, your dad stormed over to the car.",
      "HAILEY SEEL: Oh, no. No, he did not.",
      "DANA CHANDLER: And he started banging on the window.",
      "HAILEY SEEL: Wha? No. No, he did not. I was inside that car and my dad absolutely did not bang on the windows.",

      "HAILEY SEEL: You were the first one out of the car.",
      "Hailey Seel: I was just in disbelief because I knew she just made that up because it never happened, and he never did that. \u2026 But \u2026 I didn't get concerned. I just said \"no, you know. I'm glad you asked so I can straighten this out. That never happened.\" And then it comes down to who's believable. And I wasn't worried about that.",
      "As another way to seemingly explain some of her past behaviors, Chandler brought up that she used to have a drinking problem.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): And I did tell you that I was \u2014 I realized that I had a problem with alcohol.",
      "HAILEY SEEL: You did tell me you had a problem with alcohol.",

      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I feel like that I need to kind of tell my story to kind of put things in perspective.",
      "She testified over seven days, speaking for about 20 hours.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): You have not seen evidence that I was in Topeka, Kansas, on July 7th, 2002.",
      "Darryl Burton: There was times when she would take so long to try to get her point across.",
      "Dana Chandler's supporter, Darryl Burton, was concerned when she put herself on the stand.",
      "Darry Burton: Sometimes it seemed as though she was just rambling, you know, and that was just unfortunate. \u2026 She may have known \u2014 probably knew where she was trying to go, but she'd get lost.",
      "She again addressed issues such as her drinking and inappropriate conversations with Hailey.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I was writing emails, drinking to blackout. I'd get up the next morning and not even aware of those emails. I had a serious problem. \u2026 And horrible things I said about Karen spreading her legs. I mean, seriously, Hailey was 14 years old. (cries) I'm just so ashamed and embarrassed about that and I hated that Hailey \u2014 that I put Hailey through that.",
      "And Chandler, in her own testimony, addressed again that incident when she waited outside Karen Harkness' house to drop off Hailey and Dustin with the couple. She said it was done out of necessity.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I yelled through the window, I could not afford to feed Hailey and Dustin. And that I needed to leave them with him.",
      "Chandler contrasted those times to when she stopped drinking, showing videos of her spending time outdoors with Hailey and Dustin.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): This video was taken about 9 months into my recovery.",

      "DANA CHANDLER: I was \u2026 calling to speak with my children, Hailey, and Dustin.",
      "As to her having disagreements with Karen Harkness, she testified there were none.",
      "DANA CHANDLER: I never, ever, had any confrontations with Karen Harkness, at all.",
      "Chandler also pointed out what she said was sloppiness in the police investigation. When Chandler questioned lead detective Richard Volle, she asked about whether police were too focused on her and should have been looking more thoroughly at other possible suspects.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (In court, questioning Volle): Did you or did you not receive any leads for other suspects besides me?",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE: Uh, early on in the investigation, there were several other people that were looked at as possible leads. \u2026 So it's a matter of checking people off, to dismissing people that couldn't have done it. \u2026 Uh, when we can't dismiss them, we keep focusing on them, like we did with you.",
      "Chandler, though, said there was an area she felt law enforcement thoroughly investigated \u2014 whether she bought a .9 mm gun, like the one used in the murders and they came up empty handed.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I've never owned, purchased, or possessed a .9mm firearm.",
      "And throughout her defense, Chandler was adamant that at the time of the murders, she was in Colorado, and no one could place her in Harkness' house, or even in Kansas.",
      "It seemed like a simple question Chandler was asking Detective Volle.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court, questioning Volle): Did you ever develop any information that I was in Topeka, Kansas, on July 6th or 7th of 2002?",
      "In answering that question, Volle said there was a woman named Patty Williams who may have spotted Chandler in the state of Kansas around the time of the murders.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court, questioning Volle): What do you know about Patty?",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE: She was a clerk at a convenience store in WaKeeney, Kansas.",
      "The gas station/convenience store in WaKeeney, where Williams worked, was nearly halfway between Denver and Topeka. It had been visited by an investigator, searching for locations where someone may have spotted Chandler around the time of the murders. There, the investigator showed Williams the photo of Chandler seen below.",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): She was seven out of 10 that it was you.",
      "According to Volle, the clerk was 70% \u00a0sure she had seen Dana Chandler and described some distinguishing features.",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): She had, or said that she had gray near the hairline \u2026",
      "Chandler though, told the jury, she did not have gray hair back then. By the time of the trials, Williams had died and could not be questioned again. Chandler also expressed concern that the investigator only showed a single photo of her initially, instead of an array of photos, including different people\u2014something Volle did do when he went to the gas station about two weeks later.",
      "DET. RICHARD VOLLE (in court): We later \u2014 later went out with a \u2014 what we call a six-pack photo, it's uh six photographs of people that looked very similar and amongst those photos was Ms. Chandler.",
      "Volle said Williams immediately picked out Chandler, and again was 70 percent sure she saw her there. But Volle acknowledged using an array initially would have been better.",
      "There was still, for law enforcement, the issue regarding Dana Chandler's alibi. Remember, Volle said Chandler told him she was home in her Denver apartment the night of the murders. But she told others, including an acquaintance, Jeff Bailey, she slept in her car in the Colorado mountains that night.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I was confused \u2026",
      "Chandler told the jury she had been confused when she spoke with Volle, but Prosecutor Kitt was not accepting that explanation.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): So what you told Detective Volle is not consistent with what you told Jeff Bailey, is it?",
      "DANA CHANDLER: Uh, as far as my trip to \u2013",
      "CHARLES KITT: Ms. Chandler, it's not consistent \u2013",
      "DANA CHANDLER: Oh, that part. OK. Yeah. I would agree with that. Um, I would \u2014 that's true \u2026",
      "Once again, those secret recordings Hailey made with her mother were played in court:",
      "DANA CHANDLER: \u2026 you ever think about killin' him?",
      "HAILEY SEEL:\u00a0 No, but \u2014",
      "DANA CHANDLER: I did.",
      "This time, Kitt questioned Chandler herself about its authenticity.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): Was that your voice saying, \"Did you ever think about killing him?\" \"I did\"?",
      "DANA CHANDLER: It sounds like it yes.",
      "When it was time for the final witness, Chandler decided it should be Dana Chandler. She knew the jury heard witnesses testify about her parenting and past behavior. Chandler explained if she was a less than an attentive mother, it was because of her drinking and a lack of money, not a lack of love.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): \u00a0I absolutely did want to have a relationship with my children. You know I think the financial, substance abuse combination, um it just wasn't feasible. So, that's all I have, thank you. Oh, cross.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): Ms. Chandler, during this time that you couldn't afford to feed your children, you were buying booze, correct?",
      "DANA CHANDLER: I was.",
      "CHARLES KITT: Buying enough alcohol to get blackout drunk?",
      "DANA CHANDLER: I was.",
      "CHARLES KITT: OK, thank you. I have no further questions.",
      "And with that, after 18 days of testimony, Kitt and Chandler presented their closing arguments.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): Why are Mike and Karen dead? And the evidence shows one simple answer, control.",
      "Hailey Seel: I think Kitt nailed it when he said it was about control.",
      "The state described Chandler losing control of Mike Sisco, as he planned his future with Karen Harkness, and the rage that followed.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): And that's what led to the defendant traveling to Topeka, Kansas, on July 6th and murdering them on July 7th.",
      "Kitt spoke about Chandler's depiction of events not lining up with the testimony of others.",
      "CHARLES KITT (in court): It's the defendant versus everyone. \u2026 You can believe the defendant's testimony, or you can believe everybody else that you heard from in this case.",
      "In Chandler's closing, she used a scale to make her point that prosecutors, whom she called her accusers, did not have enough evidence to tip it in their favor.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): The, uh, accusers must, uh, tip the scale. Here. I'm innocent. (pointing to scale)",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): I had my infirmities, and I have my shortcomings, but I do stand here before you all today and proclaim that I am an innocent woman.",
      "She acknowledged the life she led was not perfect but said that doesn't make her a murderer.",
      "DANA CHANDLER (in court): The state has woefully failed to meet its burden, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that I killed Mike Sisco or Karen Harkness.",
      "THE VERDICT",
      "About four hours later, the jury delivered its verdict: guilty of the murders of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness.",
      "After hearing the verdict, Chandler turned away.",
      "And while it was the verdict Seel hoped for, the end result is nothing she ever wanted.",
      "Hailey Seel: It is so much worse that my mom is the one behind these murders because we lost my dad and Karen, but then through all this, now we've lost our mom. \u2026 I really wish it was someone else.",
      "Darryl Burton: I don't believe that they have proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "Chandler's supporter, Darryl Burton, remains undeterred. He still believes she is innocent.",
      "Darryl Burton: The evidence just doesn't, you know, prove that she's guilty of anything",
      "Chandler is filing motions for an appeal. \"48 Hours\" reached out to Chandler again for this episode, but did not receive a response.",
      "Mike Kagay: I am very confident in this verdict.",
      "District Attorney Mike Kagay is certain the jury convicted the right person.",
      "Mike Kagay: I have every confidence in my prosecutors and how they handled this case.",
      "Hailey Seel: The focus of this case has gone almost completely to Dana Chandler and that the victims \u2026 has really been lost \u2026 which is really sad.",
      "More than 20 years have passed since Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness were murdered \u2014-and Hailey wants to make sure the lives lost are not forgotten.",
      "Hailey Seel: I was trying to tell my daughter about who my dad is. (cries) \u2026 and I said \u2026 he was a really fun, supportive, encouraging guy who believed in me and my brother. \u2026And Karen \u2026 was so kind, so accepting. \u2026 I miss them a lot.",

      "\"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role,\" Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos wrote in an email to the COVID-19 vaccines work group in the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).",

      "\"You know, usually a parent tries to mold her child. Sarah molded us. She was a stronger person than I ever was,\" her father, Robert Milgrim, said of the 26-year-old, who grew up in Johnson County, Kansas. \"I'm a different person now than before this happened\u2026 from learning so much about what Sarah did and her courage\u2026 and her striving for peace.\"",
      "Sarah Milgrim made several trips to Israel, first for her bat mitzvah in Jerusalem and again in college. Then she joined Tech2Peace, a work-study program for Israelis and Palestinians. She started working for the Israeli Embassy in November 2023 after graduating with a master's degree in International Affairs\u00a0from American University, where she fell in love with Yaron.",
      "\"We saw their love blossom for each other. And we knew how strong it was,\" her father said.",
      "It wasn't until after their deaths that the Milgrims learned the couple had even bigger life plans. Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., revealed that Lischinsky, 30, was\u00a0planning to propose\u00a0to Milgrim on their upcoming trip to Israel. In the days after the shooting, Sarah's mom also learned from a friend that Sarah went ring shopping to give Yaron some tips.",
      "\"We didn't know that he was going to propose then,\" Mr. Milgrim previously\u00a0told CBS News. \"And the ambassador told us that he knew that he'd bought the ring and was going to present it to her in Jerusalem.\"",
      "\"What does it accomplish?\"",
      "Antisemitism and safety fears among Jewish-Americans rose\u00a0in the U.S. following Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, taking 250 hostage and igniting a deadly war in the Gaza Strip.\u00a0Protests over the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0emerged in cities and college campuses across the country \u2014 with some ending in violence.",
      "On Sunday, at least 12 people were injured in an\u00a0attack\u00a0on a march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado. Witnesses said the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails and was allegedly heard shouting \"Free Palestine.\" Sarah Milgrim's alleged killer also shouted \"Free, free Palestine\" before he was taken into custody,\u00a0according to law enforcement officials, who called it a targeted attack.",
      "Her older brother, Jacob, called the violence senseless.",
      "\"There is nothing more important in Judaism than life and the sanctity of life \u2014 and to what end is this fighting and sacrifice? What does it accomplish?\" he said. \"Taking my sister ... it's not going to accomplish anything.\"",
      "Now Sarah Milgrim's family is left with a hole in their hearts.",
      "\"Right now, I'm hurt. I'm too hurt to say it's anger or frustration. I don't know what I'm going to feel later on, to be honest with you,\" Mr. Milgrim said.",
      "The Milgrims are planning a trip to Israel in the fall to meet with Lischinsky's family and visit his grave.",

      "McDonald's Snack Wrap, a gone-but-not-forgotten customer favorite, is returning to the fast-food chain's restaurants in the U.S. after a nine-year hiatus.",
      "The popular sandwich will reappear on menus starting July 10, according to an announcement by the company on Tuesday in which Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA,\u00a0stated\u00a0simply, \"It's back.\"",
      "Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago. However, the item was removed from McDonald's menus in 2016 because it was too complicated for its kitchens to prepare. Customers have been calling for the Snack Wrap's return ever since.",
      "In announcing the Snack Wrap's return, the company included a link to a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, which it describes as a \"content hub for the most anticipated menu item of the decade.\" Featuring Snack Wrap wallpaper as its background, the promotional webpage includes various large folders users can click into. A folder entitled \"Fandom,\" for example, houses screenshots of social media posts from Snack Wrap fans expressing their love for the food and asking when it would be returned to McDonald's menus.",
      "In one email, entitled \"Snack Wraps for this Pregnant Lady,\" a McDonald's customer named Carli writes \"my biggest craving is something I can't have. I am due July 14th, 2025. Will snack wraps be back before then? Please just give me a hint.\"",
      "\"I've waited years and I'm getting mildly impatient\" wrote another fan called \"loyal snack wrap lover.\"",
      "Another, more proactive display of loyalty included a Change.org petition to bring back the Snack Wrap. The petition garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. Bringing back the wrap was a \"years-long process,\" Erlinger told The Associated Press.",
      "In its revived form, the Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy. This is a departure from the original version, which included a choice of grilled or fried chicken and sauce options like honey mustard and sweet chili. The simplified recipe is to ensure faster service, according to the company. The company has not revealed how much the Snack Wrap will cost, only that prices will vary depending on location.",
      "McDonald's also posted on the Snack Wrap's on its X account, thanking ardent fans for resurrecting the long-lost menu item. Breaking the fourth wall, the social media manager behind the McDonald's account\u00a0addressed\u00a0followers directly, reminding them that \"social media managers don't control the menu,\" but rather its the fans who are to thank for the Snack Wrap's revival. Stated the post, \"you created a movement. a movement so powerful that you finally won.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 05:00:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Republican tax bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number to qualify for the Child Tax Credit, a policy shift that would make millions of kids ineligible.",
    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "TSA's surveillance efforts have long attracted criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that land an individual on a list \u2014 or what gets them removed \u2014 have been mostly concealed from the public.",

      "A spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen told CBS News on Tuesday that she contacted TSA after her husband was subjected to several extensive, invasive and degrading searches at airport checkpoints \u2013 and was seeking to understand the nature and cause.",
      "Sources told CBS News that in July 2023, William Shaheen was pulled aside for extra screening at the Boston airport ahead of two flights. Officials said at the time that the security agency randomly selected travelers for additional screening, and William Shaheen had been randomly chosen.",
      "Three months later, William Shaheen was flagged by the transportation security agency because his travel companion on two flight reservations was a person listed by the FBI as a \"known or suspected terrorist,\" or KST, a broad designation that covers a wide-ranging risk profile. A federal air marshal was sent to covertly travel near them on a flight on Oct. 18, 2023, one source said.",
      "Sen. Shaheen spoke with Pekoske to ask about the situation regarding her husband. On Oct. 20, 2023, her husband was added to the \"secure flight exclusion list,\" a VIP list that exempts a traveler from the security agency's vetting and surveillance programs, including random screenings.",
      "An order from TSA headquarters was sent to ensure the safeguarded status for William Shaheen was signaled when his future boarding passes were presented at airports.",
      "The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen said she wasn't aware that her husband had been monitored under the Quiet Skies program, or that he had later been given preferential treatment by being specifically excluded from enhanced screening.",
      "The person William Shaheen traveled with, whose identity could not be confirmed by CBS News, was removed from the FBI terrorism watchlist later in 2023, sources familiar with the matter said. It was not clear why the person was placed on the list, though a host of factors including visits to hostile countries, certain suspicious travel patterns, or contacts with designated terror suspects can all contribute to the listing.",
      "The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen declined to identify her husband's travel companion other than to say the person was an Arab-American attorney. The senator was not given any indication the person was designated as a known or suspected terrorist, the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Navy plans to rename the\u00a0USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler\u00a0named after\u00a0the slain gay rights leader and Navy veteran, and is considering renaming multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders and prominent American voices, CBS News has learned.",
      "U.S. Navy documents obtained by CBS News and used to brief the secretary of the Navy and his chief of staff show proposed timelines for rolling out the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk to the public. While the documents do not say what the ship's new name would be, the proposal comes during Pride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969. WorldPride celebrations are being held in Washington, D.C., this year.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News also show other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming \"recommended list.\"",
      "Among them are the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Dolores Huerta, USNS Lucy Stone, USNS Cesar Chavez and USNS Medgar Evers.",
      "CBS News found that a December 2024 web article from Naval Sea Systems Command about the laying of the keel for the future USNS Thurgood Marshall has been deleted.",
      "\"The reported decision by the Trump Administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream,\" Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi told CBS News in a statement.",
      "She added, \"Our military is the most powerful in the world \u2013 but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News the move was \"an utter abomination in terms of the extreme MAGA Republican effort to continue to erase American history, and we're not going to allow it to happen.\" And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X that Hegseth \"should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.\"",
      "Following his confirmation in January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a\u00a0directive instructing the Pentagon and U.S. military services to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, citing concerns that such programs could undermine unity within the ranks. The \"Identity Months Dead at DoD\" guidance banned official manpower and resources from being used on such events \u2014 among them, Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month.",
      "The documents obtained by CBS News were not marked with the traditional classification markers typically seen on Defense Department memos. The documents were not marked as \"For Official Use Only\" or \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" they were also not marked to indicate they were drafts. There was a \"CAUTION\" note, however, referring to the information as publicly sensitive.",
      "The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of \"reestablishing the warrior culture.\"",
      "The documents call for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, with the notice of the name change going out to other senior U.S. Navy officials later in the week after undergoing legal review.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.\" Parnell added that any potential renaming decisions would be announced once the internal reviews are complete. Military.com first reported the name change for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, but the news of other naval vessels being considered for a name change has not yet been reported.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk is a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, designed to support carrier strike groups at sea. The class of ships is named after civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, who died in 2020.",
      "Harvey Milk, the political trailblazer, emerged in the 1970s as one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After years of activism, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, where he quickly became a national symbol of LGBTQ+ political empowerment. His life was cut short in 1978 when he was assassinated in City Hall, alongside Mayor George Moscone.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces.",
      "Before he emerged as one of the most visible advocates for gay rights in American history, Milk served in the U.S. Navy. From 1952 to 1954, he held posts as an operations and dive officer aboard two submarine rescue ships \u2014 the USS Chanticleer and the USS Kittiwake \u2014 both active during the Korean War, according to the U.S. National Archives.",
      "But his sexual orientation carried profound consequences as Milk came under scrutiny. In December 1954, Milk, who was then a lieutenant junior grade, was facing a court martial for participating in a \"homosexual act\" a year earlier.",
      "Instead of facing trial, Milk was drummed out of the U.S. military, like so many other gay service members of his era. In January 1954, he resigned his commission and accepted an \"Other Than Honorable\" discharge. In 2021, the Navy approached Milk's nephew, Stuart Milk, to see if he wanted his uncle's discharge upgraded, according to NPR. Stuart decided against it as a reminder that not everyone was treated with honor.",
      "The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy. In February, he directed Fort Liberty in North Carolina return to Fort Bragg, saying it would now be named after a non-Confederate Bragg, and then directed Fort Moore change to Fort Benning, after another Benning.",
      "The naming commission also suggested the Navy rename the guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville, which honors a Confederate battle victory, to the USS Robert Smalls, to recognize a slave who stole a Confederate ship and surrendered it to the Union. The Navy also renamed the USNS Maury to the USNS Marie Tharp, removing the name of a Confederate sailor and replacing it with the name of a pioneering female oceanographer.",
      "Although the Navy has renamed ships for various reasons, name changes are still an exceptionally rare occurrence, especially after the ships have entered service.",

McCook, 23, of Georgetown, Texas, was a member of the 22nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium), 341st Bombardment Group (Medium), 10th Air Force during World War II, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Before joining the military, McCook had graduated from Southwestern University and came from a family of pilots, according to local newspaper clippings gathered by the DPAA.",
      "McCook, nicknamed \"Woody,\" served in China and Burma, according to newspaper clippings. He was one of 20 officers and enlisted men credited for a mission that air-dropped supplies to Allied forces battling Japanese troops in northern Burma. During his service, McCook received the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "On August 3, 1943, McCook was the armor-gunner on the B-25C \"Mitchell,\" conducting a low-altitude bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, the DPAA said. The raid was meant to target the Meiktila dam and nearby Japanese barracks, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "The aircraft crashed during the mission. McCook and three others aboard the plane died, but two men survived. One of the survivors, identified in newspaper clippings as Sgt. John Boyd, said the plane had been hit by an explosive gas shell while flying at a low altitude. McCook, who Boyd recalled \"as the best in the business,\" was able to bring the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed Boyd and the other surviving soldier to parachute from the craft before it crashed.",
      "Boyd said this action allowed him to survive. He and the other soldier were taken captive by Japanese forces, the DPAA said. Boyd spent two years as a prisoner in Rangoon before he was freed, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "McCook's remains were not recovered. He was eventually listed as missing in action. In 1947, after World War II ended, the American Grave Registration Service recovered four sets of remains from a common grave near a village in Burma, the DPAA said.",
      "Locals said the four sets of remains, designated X-282A-D, were from an \"American crash,\" the DPAA said. But the remains were not identified at the time. They were interred as \"Unknowns\" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, or the Punchbowl, in Honolulu, Hawaii. McCook's name was listed on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In January 2022, the DPAA disinterred all four sets of remains and taken to the agency's laboratory. Dental, anthropological and isotope analyses were conducted. Other military agencies used mitochondrial DNA analysis and genome sequencing data to help identify the remains. The processes allowed the DPAA to identify one of the sets of remains as belonging to McCook.",
      "Now that McCook has been accounted for, a rosette has been placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing. He will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, the DPAA said.",

      "The controversial U.S.-backed humanitarian aid operation in Gaza, which has been mired by reports of dozens of Palestinians being killed trying to reach its distribution hubs in the war-torn enclave since it started work just over a week ago, said it was pausing its operations for Wednesday. The\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0said in a statement posted on social media that the pause was \"for update, organization, and efficiency improvement work,\" but a spokesperson for the group said it was working to address security concerns.",
      "GHF said in its brief statement that operations would resume on Thursday.",
      "The United Nations and other aid agencies have refused to work with the group, calling it a distraction and accusing it of weaponizing access to desperately needed food. More than 50 people have been killed by Israeli forces near the sites, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which has called the GHF effort a trap for hungry Palestinians.",
      "The Israeli military has denied the accusations and accused Hamas of shooting at people seeking aid.",
      "The funding, operational details and origins of the GHF have remained murky since its inception, and it has been plagued not only by grave questions about security for civilians accessing its hubs, but by potentially existential issues regarding its internal operations.",
      "The move comes just days after GHF said it would shutter its Switzerland-based office after officials there told CBS News the foundation was violating Swiss rules for non-governmental organizations. It also comes just a day after\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported that U.S.-based consulting firm Boston Global had severed its ties with the group and launched an internal review over its involvement with GHF.",
      "GHF said it began work in Gaza on May 27, but it remains unclear where it is based and who is funding its operations. Its official\u00a0website\u00a0consists only of a homepage bearing its name and the message: \"More information coming soon.\"",
      "A GHF spokesperson told CBS News in a statement sent Wednesday that the group was \"actively engaged in discussions with\" Israel's military aimed at enhancing security \"beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites.\"",
      "The organization said it had asked the Israel Defense Forces to \"guide foot traffic in a way that minimizes confusion or escalation risks\" around its ongoing military operations in Gaza, to offer clearer guidance for civilians seeking to reach its distribution hubs, and to \"enhance IDF force training and refine internal IDF procedures to support safety.\"",
      "\"Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,\" the spokesperson said in the statement, which was also shared with other news outlets.",
      "Health officials in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip said 27 Palestinians were killed trying to reach a GHF hub in southern Gaza on Tuesday alone. The Israeli military denied the claim of mass shooting at civilians, saying troops about a third of a mile away from the site had fired at several people who were deemed to present a threat after they strayed beyond the defined boundaries of the access route. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties.",
      "In a\u00a0message posted\u00a0Wednesday on social media in Arabic, IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee warned Gazans against using the roads leading to GHF distribution centers, saying they would be considered \"combat zones\" for the day and stressing that access to them was \"prohibited and dangerous.\"",
      "The IDF has repeatedly accused Hamas of sabotaging the GHF effort, accusing it of sending gunmen specifically to shoot at civilians at the aid hubs.",
      "\"We are not preventing Gaza residents from accessing aid distribution sites,\" IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said in a video statement posted online Tuesday, before the one-day pause was reported. \"Food packages are being distributed daily by a U.S.-based civilian company. This initiative is proving effective. Gazan residents are coming to the distribution centers to receive the aid. The civilian population of Gaza understands that Hamas is not taking care of them \u2014 on the contrary, Hamas is actively trying to prevent them from receiving the aid.\"",
      "Defrin said IDF forces \"operate nearby and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas.\"",
      "He also accused the United Nations' aid agencies of failing to collect and distribute more than 450 trucks carrying humanitarian aid that Israel says were allowed into Gaza in recent days but left waiting on the other side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel. The U.N. has rejected similar previous Israeli claims, noting that Israeli forces maintain control over virtually all of Gaza and that there are huge logistics challenges to operating in a densely populated active warzone.",
      "And the IDF's assault, which Israel has vowed to continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining 58 Israeli hostages are brought back home from Gaza, has continued to ramp up despite the U.S.-backed aid effort.",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza was there as Palestinians rushed to rescue survivors of an Israeli strike that destroyed a bank in Gaza City where families had taken shelter. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to first responders who spoke with CBS News at the scene. They were among 97 Palestinians killed over the preceding 24 hours alone, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which put the overall death toll from the war at 54,607 as of Wednesday.",

      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung was elected president of South Korea in a snap election sparked by the impeachment of the country's former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol. As of early Wednesday, Lee had a lead over his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo that was mathematically impossible to surpass.",
      "Kim conceded the race, telling reporters he \"humbly accepts the people's choice\" and gave Lee his congratulations.",
      "Lee didn't formally claim victory when he appeared earlier before supporters in the nation's capital, repeating his goals to reinvigorate the economy and unite the country.",
      "\"Let us move forward with hope and make a fresh start from this moment on,\" he said. \"Though we may have clashed for some time, even those who did not support us are still our fellow citizens of the Republic of Korea.\"",
      "An impressive 77.8% of the country's eligible voters turned up at polling stations Tuesday to cast their ballots. It was the highest turnout ever seen in a Korean election, and the country's media had said exit polls made a victory by Lee all but certain after the voting ended.",
      "Kim had recently served as the employment and labor minister in the Cabinet of former President Yoon, who was\u00a0impeached\u00a0over his brief but shocking imposition of martial law late last year.",
      "Lee's Democratic Party has been the primary opposition party for several years, but with the win of the South Korean presidency, the Democrats find themselves back in control of both the executive branch and the parliament, where they already have a majority of seats, for the first time since 2022.",
      "There has not been an elected president in office since Yoon was impeached late last year, so there will be no formal transition period. The inauguration ceremony for the 21st president of South Korea is set to be held Wednesday, just hours after the final votes were cast.",
      "South Koreans filled the streets around central government buildings in Seoul in December after Yoon suddenly declared martial law. He said the draconian measure was necessary given the level of political division in South Korea, and claiming communist forces were threatening the public peace and safety.",
      "But Yoon's definition of an enemy within changed, as he first said the communists infiltrating South Korean politics were North Koreans, but then said it was Chinese influence that warranted his martial law declaration.",
      "Many younger South Koreans bristled, and they came out in force in front of the parliament, urging lawmakers to impeach Yoon, who did maintain significant support, particularly among older and right-wing voters.",
      "His huge political gamble with the martial law declaration, and his subsequent refusal to leave office following his impeachment, is widely seen as having shifted many voters to Lee and the Democratic Party.",
      "Yoon beat Lee in the last presidential election in 2022, but by a razor-thin margin of only 247,077 votes.",
      "Who is Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's new leader?",
      "Lee is a veteran politician with 20 years of experience as an elected official.",
      "He will rely on that experience to help him navigate the power struggle between South Korea's longtime closest ally, the United States, and its neighbor China, as Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping engage in a trade war that has affected global markets.",
      "Lee vowed before the election that he would work to further develop the U.S.-South Korea relationship \"into a future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance.\"",
      "Lee also promised \"stable management of Korea-China relations, promotion of Korea-Russia diplomacy,\" and to prioritize South Korea's national interests.",
      "He has vowed to invest up to 100 trillion won (about $73 billion) to fund artificial intelligence work in the country, aiming to make South Korea one of the top three global AI powerhouses.",
      "But Lee has offered little in the way of firm, specific commitments, and many South Koreans remained unclear about what kind of diplomatic policies he might adopt when he takes the country's highest office.",
      "Before South Korea descended into internal political chaos in late 2024, the former conservative government had taken a hard line on North Korea and Kim Jong Un's isolated regime, fueling higher tension across the two countries' heavily militarized border.",

    "summary": "Madeleine McCann vanished from her family's vacation home in Portugal almost two decades ago. A new search is underway near a cottage previously used by the sole suspect.",
    "story": [
      "A fresh search effort has been launched for Madeleine McCann, a British toddler who disappeared from her family's vacation rental in Portugal more than 18 years ago.",
      "Police haven't disclosed any evidence to explain why they decided to carry out a new search almost two decades later, but they were focusing Tuesday on land around a cottage previously used by the only suspect in the girl's disappearance, a German man currently jailed in his home country for unrelated rape and sexual assault charges.",
      "Dozens of agents from Germany's leading domestic law enforcement agency were poring over the ground Tuesday in the Algarve, a southern Portugal region hugely popular with tourists, where Madeleine was last seen.",
      "Search teams on Tuesday scoured undergrowth and an abandoned building, with police hoping to find evidence that could implicate the convicted German sex offender in her disappearance.",
      "Madeleine was just 3 years old when she vanished from an apartment on the Algarve coast where she was on holiday with her family, sparking unprecedented media coverage and a global campaign to find her.",
      "A previous search of a lake near the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in 2023 yielded no results, but on Tuesday, investigators were back in a part of nearby Lagos to hunt for clues.",
      "Several police vehicles with Portuguese and German number plates as well as fire trucks were seen down a cordoned-off dirt road toward the search site, AFP journalists at the scene saw. Portuguese police said about 25 German investigators were present, with the investigation looking at an abandoned building in an overgrown wooded area.",
      "The new searches \u2014 carried out at the request of German authorities investigating Christian Brueckner, a convicted rapist who is suspected of having killed Madeleine \u2014 are expected to last until Friday.",
      "According to the British tabloid The Sun, investigators are equipped with ground radar technology that can scan the ground down to a depth of 15 feet. The area includes a cottage where Brueckner was living and is dotted with wells and ditches, The Sun reported.",
      "Christian Brueckner, the German suspect",
      "A mobile phone registered in Brueckner's name was traced close to the family's accommodation on the night Madeleine went missing. He has always denied any role in her disappearance.",
      "The 48-year-old is currently serving a 7-year prison sentence in Germany for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. He is due to complete his sentence in September.",
      "He was acquitted in October 2024 in Germany in a separate trial for two sexual assaults and three rapes committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.",
      "German authorities in 2020 said they were convinced Brueckner was involved in Madeleine's disappearance, which has seen several false leads.",
      "He has not been charged in connection with Madeleine's case.",
      "Brueckner, who according to German media had a string of previous convictions, including for sexual offenses, assault and theft before he was convicted of rape, worked as an odd-job man during his 10 years in the Algarve. He also reportedly burgled hotel rooms and holiday apartments.",
      "At the time of Madeleine's disappearance, he was living in a camper van.",
      "On Tuesday, a journalist from Germany's RTL television recounted his correspondence with Brueckner and how he had met him in prison.",
      "Brueckner, the journalist said, complained that \"half the world\" considered him to be a \"cruel rapist.\" He said he wanted to eat steak and drink beer when he is released from prison.",
      "A former neighbor in Portugal had told Britain's Sky News in 2020 that Brueckner was \"always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane, and then one day, around 2006, he just disappeared without a word.\"",
      "He returned to Germany in 2007 \u2014 the year Madeleine disappeared \u2014 settling in Hanover, but still spent time in Portugal.",
      "On May 3, 18 years since their daughter's disappearance, Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann said they were still determined to find out what happened.",
      "\"The years appear to be passing even more quickly and whilst we have no significant news to share, our determination to 'leave no stone unturned' is unwavering,\" they wrote on the findmadeleine.com website. \"We will do our utmost to achieve this.\"",

Indonesia's highest court upheld the death sentence for Sandiford in 2013.",

      "More than 200 inmates escaped from a prison and at least one was killed in a shootout in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi after they were temporarily moved out of their cells due to earthquake tremors, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Kashif Abbasi, a senior police official, said 216 inmates fled the prison in the capital of Sindh province. Of those, 78 had been recaptured. No one convicted or facing trial as a militant was among those who fled, he said.",
      "One prisoner was killed and three security officials wounded in the ensuing shootout, but the situation has been brought under control, Abbasi said, adding that police were conducting raids to capture the remaining escapees.",
      "Zia-ul-Hasan Lanjar, the provincial law minister, told reporters at the scene the inmates were allowed into the courtyard and there was \"panic\" because of the tremors, the Reuters news agency reports. The breakout began just before midnight on Monday and was continuing in the early hours of Tuesday, he said.",
      "The inmates were still outside the cells when a group suddenly attacked guards, seized their weapons, opened fire and fled, officials said.",
      "The superintendent of Malir prison, Arshad Shah, said the inmates fled toward a nearby residential area. According to residents, police later used mosque loudspeakers to alert them to the jailbreak and seek help in arresting the escapees.",
      "Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, who isn't related to the prison official, asked the escapees in televised comments to voluntarily return, saying they'd only been involved in minor crimes until that point. But he said they could face terror charges if they're arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.",
      "Though prisoners have escaped while being transported to court for trial, prison breaks aren't common in Pakistan, where authorities have enhanced security since 2013, when the Pakistani Taliban freed more than 200 inmates in an attack on a prison in the northwestern district of Dera Ismail Khan.

    "story": [
      "U.S. economic growth is likely to hit the brakes this year, with GDP dramatically slowing due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and uncertainty around its economic policies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, said Tuesday.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, according to the OECD, an international organization of 38 member countries that focuses on promoting economic growth.",
      "While the OECD's U.S. forecast didn't mention President Trump by name, the report cited new tariffs as one of the primary causes of the economic slowdown. The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart, those costs are largely passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs \u2014 prompting the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will \"spike in mid-2025\" and reach 3.9% by the end of 2025.",
      "The Consumer Price Index rose by\u00a02.3% in April, as the tariffs largely hadn't yet impacted prices at that point.",
      "Without mentioning Mr. Trump, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary that accompanied the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.''",
      "The report added that the U.S. is facing risks \"skewed to the downside, including a more substantial slowing of economic activity in the face of policy uncertainty, greater-than-expected upward pressure on prices from tariff increases, and large financial market corrections.\"",
      "World economic growth is also forecast to slow to 2.9% this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD's forecast. That would mark a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3% global growth last year and 3.4% in 2023.",

      "Lawler has said that he'll make a decision on whether to run for governor or for re-election this month.",
      "But Trump last month endorsed Lawler for re-election, a likely sign that the president would rather have the congressman seek re-election as the House GOP fights to protect its razor-thin majority in the chamber rather than seek the governor's office.",
      "Another Trump supporter, Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman, has also mulled a run for governor.",
      "Asked about a potential GOP primary for governor, Stefanik said, \"I think Republicans will work it out. We know how important it is to unify again.\"",

      "The DGA praised Hochul in a statement after Delgado's announcement.",
      "\"Governor Kathy Hochul is a proven leader with a strong record of delivering for New Yorkers: The Democratic Governors Association is 100 percent behind Governor Hochul as she continues to deliver for New York, take on Donald Trump, and build the operation it will take to beat Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026,\" DGA executive director Meghan Meehan-Draper wrote.",
      "But Stefanik said the news of the primary challenge backed up her arguments.",
      "\"I dubbed Kathy Hochul the worst governor in America because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s not just Republicans. It\u2019s independent and Democrat voters as well across this state who understand that she has failed, she has delivered catastrophic failed policies in New York,\" Stefanik said.",

      "The federal government has struggled for decades with staffing issues in key roles like cybersecurity, tech and other high-skill areas, an issue flagged\u00a0as far back as 2001, according to the Government Accountability Office. Vianello discussed how SkillStorm is attempting to solve those issues.",
      "\"If we look at the procurement process and the way it's been structured, there's significant delays,\" Vianello told Fox News Digital. \"So, it can take years to actually get to a point where a solicitation is actually awarded. And then, ironically or paradoxically, post that award, the agency will expect \u2026 the particular company to be able to deliver a team in 10 days.

      "Vianello says the company has spent millions of dollars in recent years building a Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence that is essentially a learning management training system with a customized curriculum and content along with a \"stable of trainers\" in a position to \"rapidly upskill and deploy people.\"",
      "\"How do we leverage that infrastructure to build out a solution for the federal government?\" Vianello said. \"Well, what we do is we leverage that infrastructure to accelerate and train teams. And the way the model works is we both bring people into our program. We train them for anywhere between 10 and 16 weeks. We pay them while we're training them. We help them achieve their certification, and then we deploy them. And we recover the investment that we make by billing them hourly.\"",

      "\"Now this is the perfect solution to being able to custom-build tech teams, create net new talent for the ecosystem and being able deploy these people over time. But the government is gonna have to change the procurement system to not require people to be deployed within 10 days but allow companies to build these teams over two, three, four months.\"",
      "Another issue, Vianello told Fox News Digital, is the current hiring process can get tied up with security clearances and become a national security risk.",
      "\"That's absolutely part of it, but I think there's a bigger issue here if you look more generally at our model and some of the issues that are facing the market,\" Vianello said. \"Well, if you look at SkillStorm's model, SkillStorm has an innovative cost-effective solution to custom-build U.S.-based tech teams for rapid deployment.",

      "Adidas confirms vendor breach: Here\u2019s what we know",
      "Adidas has officially acknowledged that a third-party vendor suffered a breach, resulting in unauthorized access to consumer data. In a\u00a0public notice titled \"Data Security Information,\" the company revealed that a \"third-party customer service provider\" had been compromised. While the brand was initially silent on the scope, it had already been reported earlier this month that customers in Turkey and Korea had received breach notifications.",

Instead, it involved contact details submitted by users to Adidas\u2019 help desk in the past.",

      "What information was involved",
      "The affected data does not contain passwords, credit card or any other payment-related information. Nor have any Social Security numbers been impacted.",
      "It mainly consists of contact information relating to customers who had contacted our customer service help desk in the past. This may have included one or more of the following: name, email address, telephone number, gender and/or birth date.",
      "What we are doing",
      "Privacy and the security of your data is our priority. Upon becoming aware of this incident, adidas took proactive and immediate steps to investigate and contain the incident. This includes further enhancing security measures and resetting passwords for customer service accounts.",
      "What you can do",
      "We are currently unaware of any harm (such as identity theft or fraud) being caused to our customers as a result of this incident. There are no immediate steps that you need to take. Although, as always, please remain vigilant and look out for any suspicious messages. As a reminder, adidas will never directly contact you to ask that you provide us with financial information, such as your credit card details, bank account information or passwords.",
      "Who you can contact",

      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "What Adidas hasn\u2019t said about the vendor hack",
      "Despite the official acknowledgment, several questions remain unanswered. Adidas has yet to clarify whether this is a single breach affecting multiple regions or several separate incidents. The lack of transparency around the name of the third-party vendor and the absence of concrete numbers or locations for affected users has created frustration among observers and possibly among customers themselves.",
      "The earlier regional reports from Turkey and Korea might suggest that this incident was either global in scale or that similar third-party vendors were independently targeted. In either case, the company's current handling of the situation has left room for speculation. Adidas claims it is in the process of informing potentially affected customers, but it has not detailed the method or timeline for this outreach.",
      "We reached out to adidas for a comment, and a representative referred us to this statement on their\u00a0website.

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Adidas data breach:",
      "1. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Adidas breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email and phone number, Adidas attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Adidas breach. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.",

      "The process starts in the data center, where large AI models are trained on Nvidia supercomputers. Hospitals then use digital twins to test and train robots in virtual settings before deploying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring that these systems are both safe and effective.",

      "Nurabot is already making a difference in daily hospital operations. The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",
      "Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients.",

      "The story of\u00a0AirCar begins in Slovakia, where designer \u0160tefan Klein and his team have been working on flying cars since the late 1980s. After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year. Customer deliveries are planned for early 2026, and the company even has plans for an amphibious version that could land on water.",

      "RADICAL NEW TECH BRINGS FLYING CARS CLOSER TO REALITY",
      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

      "ORLANDO'S PLAN FOR FLYING CARS TAKES OFF",
      "Performance that impresses",
      "Under the hood, the production AirCar will offer three engine options, all 3.2-liter V6s from South African company Adept Airmotive. The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot.",

      "THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES",
      "What licenses do you need to drive and fly the AirCar?",
      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it. This means owners will need both driving and flying licenses, along with access to a runway, to fully experience everything the AirCar can do.",

      "Pricing and who the AirCar is for",
      "The AirCar is expected to cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million, which puts it in the same category as high-end supercars and small private planes. It is geared toward mega-rich business travelers, air taxi operators and anyone who wants to skip traffic and simply fly over it instead.",
      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does it compare to other flying cars?",
      "Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production. It is also one of the few with four wheels, making it truly road-legal in most places. While other companies have spent hundreds of millions on similar ideas, Klein Vision has achieved this on a much smaller budget.",

This is a vehicle you could actually see on the road and in the air pretty soon. Sure, you'll need a pilot's license and a pretty big budget, but the fact that something like this is even possible is pretty amazing. Honestly, the idea that we might spot a car rolling up to a runway and then lifting off in just a year or two is kind of crazy.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities.

      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

I first reported on Lumma in February 2024, when it was\u00a0used by hackers to access Google accounts using expired cookies that contained login information.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself from infostealer malware",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Lumma had become a go-to tool for cybercriminals, targeting everything from browser credentials to crypto wallets across Windows and Mac systems. I\u2019ve been tracking this malware since early 2024, and its ability to impersonate human verification pages and abuse expired cookies made it especially dangerous.",

Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",

Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent.

    "story": [
      "ALS patient communicates with the world using only his thoughts.",
      "Imagine losing your ability to speak or move, yet still having so much to say.",
      "For Brad G. Smith, this became his reality after being diagnosed with ALS, a rare and progressive disease that attacks the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement.",
      "But thanks to a groundbreaking Neuralink brain implant, Smith is now able to communicate with the world using only his thoughts.",

      "ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family. (Bradford G. Smith/X)",
      "Life before Neuralink",
      "Before receiving the\u00a0Neuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations.\u00a0\"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"\u00a0Smith shared in a\u00a0recent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible. Now, Smith says,\u00a0\"Neuralink lets me go outside and ignore lighting changes.\"",

      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "How the Neuralink brain implant works",
      "Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement.",
      "Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone.",
      "As Smith explains, \"The Neuralink implant embedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\"",

      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "Training the brain-computer connection",
      "Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

      "Everyday life: Communication, play, and problem-solving",
      "The Neuralink implant has given Smith new ways to interact with his family and the world. He can now play games like Mario Kart with his children and communicate more quickly than before. The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

      "AI assistance: Keeping up with conversation",
      "To speed up communication even more, Smith uses Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. Grok helps him write responses and even suggests witty replies. \"We have created a chat app that uses AI to listen to the conversation and gives me options to say in response. It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared. One example? When a friend needed a gift idea for his girlfriend who loves horses, the AI suggested a bouquet of carrots.",
      "ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family. (Bradford G. Smith/X)",
      "The human side: Family, faith and perspective",
      "Smith's journey has been shaped by more than just technology. He credits his wife, Tiffany, as his\u00a0\"best caregiver I could ever imagine,\" and recognizes the support of his kids, friends and family. Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",
      "ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family. (Bradford G. Smith/X)",
      "Looking ahead: What does this mean for others?",
      "Neuralink's technology is still in its early stages, but Smith's experience is already making waves. The company recently received a \"breakthrough\" designation from the Food and Drug Administration for its brain implant device, which hopes to help people with severe speech impairments caused by ALS, stroke, spinal cord injury and other neurological conditions.",

      "Smith's story is about resilience, creativity and the power of technology to restore something as fundamental as the ability to communicate. As Smith puts it, \"Neuralink is giving me freedom, hope and faster communication. Overall, the whole Neuralink experience has been fantastic. It has improved my life so much. I'm so happy to be involved in something big that will help many people.\"\u00a0While ALS \"really sucks,\" as Smith says, his journey shows how innovation and determination can bring light to even the darkest rooms. And perhaps most importantly, it reminds us that behind every breakthrough, there are real people, real families and real stories of hope.",

    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",
      "A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot. (MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

      "Final Thought",

    "summary": "Discover how Defendnot bypasses Microsoft Defender by registering a fake antivirus, exposing vulnerabilities in Windows&apos; antivirus management system.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",
      "Windows software on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

      "A 2.45-kWh lithium-ion battery powers the Hydroflyer Sport, giving you anywhere from one and a half to three hours of ride time, depending on how hard you push it. The top speed is an impressive 28 mph, and you can travel up to 25 miles on a single charge. The Hydroflyer Sport's modular design lets you swap out parts or customize your setup.

However, attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the law doesn't apply to regulatory matters like cannabis, an industry that is regulated in California.",

      "James, a grandmother who suffers from arthritis and a degenerative disc disorder, makes her own medicinal cream with the cannabis she cultivates to ease the daily pain due to her disorder, the lawsuit said.

      "EXCLUSIVE: U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee stressed the importance of acknowledging the Jewish people's historic connection to the Land of Israel, describing global efforts to deny this link as \"absurd.\"",

      "Huckabee pointed to archaeological evidence as strong support for the biblical account. \"The excavations at the City of David alone are a validation of the biblical record of what really did happen here. Sometimes people on the far-left love to say 'follow the science, follow the science,' and I would say to them, as it relates to the land and the connections to the Jewish people, follow the science of archaeology.\"",

      "The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\"",
      "\"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer said.",

Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\"",
      "\"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\"",

      "The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\"",
      "\"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s overnight volley of social media posts revealed his frustrations with decision makers whose cooperation he needs to secure some of his top economic objectives.",
      "Early Wednesday morning, Trump pointed to fresh data from private payroll processor ADP showing the weakest monthly jobs total since March 2023 as further evidence that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to make borrowing easier for consumers and businesses.",
      "\u201cADP NUMBER OUT!!! \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (The European Central Bank has in fact cut interest rates seven times since last June.)",
      "The remarks extend the president\u2019s long-running, unprecedented pressure campaign on the Fed chief, whom he invited to the White House last week and renewed that demand in person. The meeting prompted a terse statement from the central bank emphasizing its independence from political influence.",
      "Trump\u2019s post early Wednesday came after a separate one he posted overnight complaining about his efforts to reach a new trade agreement with China and its president, Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cI like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d Trump wrote at 2:17 a.m.",
      "After campaigning on immediate economic relief for U.S. households, Trump has spent his first several months back in the White House attempting to rewrite the rules of global trade in America\u2019s favor. In the process, he and his top officials have sought to check voters\u2019 expectations as the U.S. presses dozens of countries for new trade deals that many have proved less eager to strike as swiftly as the administration has hoped.",
      "Meanwhile, court rulings have gummed up some of the president\u2019s unprecedented tariff agenda, which economists increasingly say could trigger \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 higher inflation alongside lower growth and higher unemployment.",
      "Trump is also grappling with pushback on his massive agenda bill from Elon Musk \u2014 previously his highest-profile and most-well-resourced ally \u2014 after the tech titan called the bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d Tuesday. NBC News reported Wednesday that House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump is \u201cnot happy\u201d about Musk\u2019s \u201c180\u201d on his agenda. Trump has not directly commented on Musk\u2019s comments.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office now projects the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.",
      "Trump has brushed aside the concerns, using the presidential bully pulpit to assign blame to those he perceives as obstacles to his economic agenda \u2014 messages that senior administration officials are amplifying.",
      "\u201cThe President did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week about his meeting with Powell. \u201cThe President\u2019s been very vocal about that, both publicly and now I can reveal privately as well.\u201d",
      "Forthcoming economic data may fan the president\u2019s frustrations anew. Analysts expect fresh federal jobs data later this week to show 125,000 U.S. job gains last month, fewer than the 177,000 added in April. That report is due for release Friday morning, a day after the European Central Bank is widely expected to lower rates again when it updates its monetary policy on Thursday.",
      "But Europe\u2019s economic outlook is far more uncertain than that of the United States. Inflation in the Euro area now hovers below the ECB\u2019s target of 2% as the bloc has grown just 0.3% in the first quarter. Typically the economic engine of the region, Germany has contracted for two years in a row and trade tension could make matters worse. In general, E.U. growth has been hit by weaker energy prices, slower wage growth, and a strengthening currency that have all put pressure on business activity.",
      "By contrast, Goldman Sachs expects U.S. GDP to expand by more than 3% in the second quarter.",
      "If Trump has been frustrated so far, he may still hold some cards that allows him to see his agenda through \u2014 though it may involve relenting on some key issues. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller \u2014 a Trump appointee \u2014 gave an updated view of the current economic landscape.",
      "\u201cAs of today, I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025,\u201d Waller said Monday at a conference in South Korea, \u201cbut how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, frustrated over what he saw as numbers of arrests and deportations of unauthorized immigrants that were too low, berated and threatened to fire senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials if they did not begin detaining 3,000 migrants a day, according to two sources who spoke to attendees.",
      "Miller also threatened to fire leaders of field offices posting the bottom 10% of arrest numbers monthly, the two sources said.",
      "Weeks later, ICE is launching the Trump administration\u2019s largest immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cOperation At Large,\u201d a nationwide, ICE-led plan already underway to ramp up arrests of unauthorized immigrants, includes more than 5,000 personnel from across federal law enforcement agencies and up to 21,000 National Guard troops, according to an operation plan described to NBC News by three sources with knowledge of the personnel allocations who detailed the previously unreported plans.",
      "Drawing those numbers from other law enforcement agencies, though, has been a source of tension among some officials, who feel they have been taken off other core national security missions, according to three additional law enforcement and military officials.\u00a0Like others interviewed for this article, they requested anonymity in order to share sensitive information.",
      "It is the latest example of how President Donald Trump\u2019s push for mass deportations is reshaping federal law enforcement as officials shift resources toward immigration-related cases \u2014 including nonviolent administrative offenses \u2014 leaving less time and attention for other types of criminal investigations.",
      "The plan calls for using 3,000 ICE agents, including 1,800 from Homeland Security Investigations, which generally investigates transnational crimes and is not typically involved in arresting noncriminal immigrants; 2,000 Justice Department employees from the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration; and 500 employees from Customs and Border Protection. It also includes 250 IRS agents, some of whom may be used to provide information on the whereabouts of immigrants using tax information, while others would have the authority to make arrests, according to the operation plan.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has also requested the use of 21,000 National Guard members to provide support in ICE operations, according to two additional sources familiar with the request, though that number has yet to be approved by the Defense Department or by governors who would be deploying their state\u2019s units, multiple sources cautioned.Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, responding to the Miller meeting, said,\u00a0\u201cKeeping President Trump\u2019s promise to deport illegal aliens is something the Administration takes seriously. We are committed to aggressively and efficiently removing illegal aliens from the United States, and ensuring our law enforcement officers have the resources necessary to do so. The safety of the American people depends upon it.\u201d",
      "Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, \u201cUnder Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump\u2019s and the American people\u2019s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.\u201d",
      "More than a dozen current and former law enforcement sources described other changes inside federal law enforcement driven by the Trump administration\u2019s focus on immigration.",
      "At the FBI, where it was once unusual for special agents to go on immigration-related law enforcement operations, according to multiple current and former law enforcement officials, field offices around the country have been ordered to assign significantly more agents to assist with ICE operations to arrest people on administrative immigration warrants.",
      "Misdemeanor cases for border crossings are regularly appearing in federal court, a rarity in recent years. Justice Department teams focused on other issues are being disbanded, with members being dispersed to teams focused on immigration and other administration priorities.",
      "And prosecutors say cases without immigration components have stalled or are moving more slowly, according to documents seen by NBC News and conversations with six current and former prosecutors and a senior FBI official, who described how immigration is now a central part of discussions around whether to pursue cases.",
      "\u201cImmigration status is now question No. 1 in terms of charging decisions,\u201d an assistant U.S. attorney said. \u201cIs this person a documented immigrant? Is this person an undocumented immigrant? Is this person a citizen? Are they somehow deportable? What is their immigration status? And the answer to that question is now largely driving our charging decisions.\u201d",
      "At least one U.S. attorney\u2019s office abandoned a potential federal prosecution of someone who prosecutors felt was dangerous because the case against the person lacked an immigration component, an email obtained by NBC News showed. The office instead left the case to state prosecutors.",
      "Reorganizing federal law enforcement to prioritize immigration could have sweeping long-term effects on the U.S. justice system. The Trump administration set early quotas for immigration arrests and has marshaled resources to go far beyond early statements about focusing only on deporting violent criminals, as well as invoking laws that have not previously been used for immigration enforcement, like the Alien Enemies Act.Prioritizing immigration also means shifting finite resources in ways that de-prioritize other cases. Last month, FBI field offices around the country shifted agents from other beats to immigration enforcement, according to current and former FBI officials and memos obtained by NBC News. A senior FBI official wrote in a memo to bureau managers that the Justice Department \u201cexpects a significant increase in the number of agents participating in immigration enforcement operations.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that \u201cimmigration security is national security,\u201d pointing to the Egyptian national accused of launching an antisemitic attack in Colorado on Sunday. The man entered the United States on a valid visa before he filed for asylum, after which the visa expired. Jackson argued the administration\u2019s moves to prioritize immigration enforcement will not carry an opportunity cost.",
      "\u201cEnforcing our immigration laws and removing illegal aliens is one big way President Trump is \u2018Making America Safe Again.\u2019 But the president can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Jackson continued. \u201cWe\u2019re holding all criminals accountable, whether they\u2019re illegal aliens or American citizens. That\u2019s why nationwide murder rates have plummeted, fugitives from the FBI\u2019s most wanted list have been captured, and police officers are empowered to do their jobs, unlike under the Biden Administration\u2019s soft-on-crime regime.\u201d",
      "(Falling murder rates predate the second Trump administration, with rates rising during and immediately after the Covid pandemic before dropping in each of 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024, according to FBI data.)",
      "How immigration is affecting other law enforcement operations",
      "Still, federal law enforcement officials who spoke to NBC News said the increased focus on cases with an immigration angle is pulling resources from other law enforcement priorities.",
      "\u201cThere is such a priority on making immigration arrests that it takes longer to get answers on anything else. Something that used to be resolved in a matter of days now takes weeks,\u201d a law enforcement official said.",
      "The shift in resources affects not only the type of cases taken but also the type of personnel involved in immigration raids. The FBI is almost always the agency leading the charge in joint investigations, but it has traditionally avoided getting involved in enforcement operations that involve only immigration enforcement, current and former officials confirmed.",
      "Those operations, which are led by ICE, involve noncriminal administrative removal warrants for immigration offenses, not the type of criminal warrants the FBI typically serves, three officials said.",
      "Since Trump took office, the FBI has routinely joined ICE operations. Some FBI employees have received guidance to minimize the actions they take during immigration-related raids and, particularly, to avoid entering into homes when they join ICE operations, four current and former law enforcement officials said.",
      "The Trump administration is also deliberating over creating a task force led by a senior leader from the Department of Homeland Security and a senior leader from the Justice Department, according to an undated draft implementation guide reviewed by NBC News and a person familiar with the deliberations. It is unclear whether that version is the most current draft under consideration.",
      "The Homeland Security Task Force would work in the FBI and ICE field offices across the country to \u201cidentify and target for prosecution transnational criminal organizations engaged in diverse criminal schemes,\u201d the draft said. It continues: \u201cIn addition to the prosecution of the above criminal violations, the mission of the HSTF is further to facilitate the removal of criminal aliens from the United States.\u201d",
      "The draft plan raises questions about which additional federal resources could be pulled in solely to focus on immigration. It says the new task force would work with the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon to \u201cassist with targeting and investigations.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, it is unclear whether or when the shifting resources and reorganization will result in the Trump administration\u2019s hitting its desired deportation numbers, like the 3,000-person daily quota Miller demanded in the mid-May meeting. ICE no longer posts comprehensive daily arrest statistics, but on social media, it has posted details of at least 350 arrests since May 26."

    "summary": "Anti-vaccine activists seized on a measles outbreak in Seminole, Texas, and turned the small Mennonite city into a battleground between fringe doctors and mainstream medicine.",
    "story": [
      "SEMINOLE, Texas \u2014 On a Saturday in mid-March, Dr. Ben Edwards put on his scrubs and drove to a sheet metal building in this tiny West Texas city to treat children with measles. Red spots mottled his face; Edwards was sick with measles, too.",
      "An outbreak of the disease was swelling in Gaines County, a rural community with one of the lowest childhood vaccination rates in the country. For two weeks, lines of families had snaked around the building\u2019s dusty parking lot, almost all belonging to the area\u2019s Mennonite community, a religious group known to speak Low German and keep to themselves, mostly sending their children to church-run schools. The parents were concerned by the illness that had speckled their children\u2019s bodies and weakened their breathing, but their distrust of vaccines and hospitals ran deeper. Edwards\u2019 alternatives seemed a safer bet.",
      "Hastily repurposed from general store to clinic, the space Edwards worked in held little besides folding tables, plastic chairs and boxes of vitamins and supplements flown in by private plane. Feverish children coughed and whimpered. A flushed baby lay in his mother\u2019s arms. Another child curled under a blanket on her mother\u2019s lap. A crew from the anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense documented it all.",
      "Edwards handed out cod liver oil \u2014 pungent liquids and pills rich in vitamins A and D \u2014 and prescribed steroid inhalers. Neither treatment can prevent or cure measles, and medical associations have warned against them; Edwards said he had seen the therapies \u201cwork beautifully.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had nowhere else to turn,\u201d Edwards said later on his podcast, defending his decision to run the children\u2019s clinic while he was contagious.",
      "But down the road at Seminole\u2019s only hospital, a waiting room made for measles patients often sat empty. And even as infections soared, there was little demand for the only proven way of preventing them: On a recent weekday, just four people had come by the county\u2019s free vaccine clinic.",
      "For more on this story, watch \"Hallie Jackson NOW\" on NBC News NOW at 5 p.m. ET",
      "So two responses were in motion to deal with an extremely contagious disease that threatens small children the most. One was grounded in science and evidence, led by overwhelmed public health officials. The other was driven by distrust and propaganda \u2014 spread by anti-vaccine activists and alternative practitioners like Edwards, and, for the first time in memory, backed by the federal government itself under Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "As founder, chairman and chief counsel of the nonprofit Children\u2019s Health Defense, Kennedy had spent two decades building the modern anti-vaccine movement. Now, as health secretary, he was downplaying the dangers of measles, spreading falsehoods about the risk of vaccines and urging parents to \u201cdo your own research.\u201d"

      "A possible new dwarf planet has been discovered at the edge of our solar system, so far-flung that it takes around 25,000 years to complete one orbit around the sun.",
      "The object, known as 2017 OF201, was found by researchers at the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University who were searching for \u201cPlanet Nine,\u201d a hypothetical planet larger than Earth that is thought to orbit beyond Neptune. Some astronomers theorize that a mysterious ninth planet, which so far remains undetected, could explain an unusual clustering of objects and other anomalies observed in the outer solar system.",
      "In searching for the elusive Planet Nine, researchers instead turned up a different resident in our cosmic backyard.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very different from how Pluto was discovered,\u201d said Sihao Cheng, a member at the Institute for Advanced Study who led the research team. \u201cThis project was really an adventure.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, the newfound dwarf planet would be what Cheng calls an \u201cextreme cousin\u201d of Pluto. The findings were published on the preprint website arXiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.",
      "Cheng and his colleagues estimate that 2017 OF201 measures about 435 miles across \u2014 significantly smaller than Pluto, which measures nearly 1,500 miles across.",
      "A dwarf planet is classified as a celestial body that orbits the sun that has enough mass and gravity to be mostly round, but unlike other planets, has not cleared its orbital path of asteroids and other objects.",
      "Eritas Yang, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and a graduate student at Princeton University, said that one of 2017 OF201\u2019s most interesting features is its extremely elongated orbit. At its farthest point from the sun, the object is more than 1,600 times more distant than the Earth is to the sun.",
      "The researchers found the dwarf planet candidate by meticulously sifting through a huge data set from a telescope in Chile that was scanning the universe for evidence of dark energy. By cobbling together observations over time, the researchers identified a moving object with migrations that followed a clear pattern.",
      "2017 OF201 is likely one of the most distant visible objects in the solar system, but its discovery suggests there could be other dwarf planets populating that region of space.",
      "\u201cWe were using public data that has been there for a long time,\u201d said Jiaxuan Li, a study co-author and a graduate student at Princeton University. \u201cIt was just hidden there.\u201d",
      "Li said the object is close to the sun at the moment, which means the researchers need to wait about a month before they can conduct follow-up observations using ground-based telescopes. The scientists are also hopeful that they can eventually secure some time to study the object with the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.",
      "In the meantime, Cheng said he hasn\u2019t given up searching for Planet Nine. The new discovery, however, may throw a wrench into some long-standing theories of the planet\u2019s existence.",
      "The hypothesis behind Planet Nine is that a planet several times the size of Earth in the outer solar system could explain why a group of icy objects seem to have unusually clustered orbits.",
      "\u201cUnder the influence of Planet Nine, all objects that do not have this specific orbital geometry will eventually become unstable and get kicked out of the solar system,\u201d Yang said.",
      "2017 OF201\u2019s elongated orbit makes it an outlier from the clustered objects, but Yang\u2019s calculations suggest that the orbit of 2017 OF201 should remain stable over roughly the next billion years.",
      "In other words, 2017 OF201 likely would not be able to remain if Planet Nine does exist. But Yang said more research is needed, and the discovery of the new dwarf planet candidate is not necessarily a death knell for Planet Nine.",
      "For one, the simulations only used one specific location for Planet Nine, but scientists don't all agree on where the hypothetical planet lurks \u2014 if it's there at all.",
      "Konstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology, proposed the existence of Planet Nine in a study published with his Caltech colleague Mike Brown in 2016.",
      "He said the discovery of 2017 OF201 doesn\u2019t prove or disprove the theory. The objects in the outer solar system that are likely to show a footprint of Planet Nine\u2019s gravity, Batygin said, are the ones where the closest points on their orbits around the sun are still distant enough that they don\u2019t strongly interact with Neptune.",
      "\u201cThis one, unfortunately, does not fall into that category,\u201d Batygin told NBC News. \u201cThis object is on a chaotic orbit, and so when it comes to the question of \u2018What does it really mean for Planet Nine?\u2019 The answer is not very much, because it\u2019s chaotic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s overnight volley of social media posts revealed his frustrations with decision makers whose cooperation he needs to secure some of his top economic objectives.",
      "Early Wednesday morning, Trump pointed to fresh data from private payroll processor ADP showing the weakest monthly jobs total since March 2023 as further evidence that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to make borrowing easier for consumers and businesses.",
      "\u201cADP NUMBER OUT!!! \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!! Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (The European Central Bank has in fact cut interest rates seven times since last June.)",
      "The remarks extend the president\u2019s long-running, unprecedented pressure campaign on the Fed chief, whom he invited to the White House last week and renewed that demand in person. The meeting prompted a terse statement from the central bank emphasizing its independence from political influence.",
      "Trump\u2019s post early Wednesday came after a separate one he posted overnight complaining about his efforts to reach a new trade agreement with China and its president, Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cI like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d Trump wrote at 2:17 a.m.",
      "After campaigning on immediate economic relief for U.S. households, Trump has spent his first several months back in the White House attempting to rewrite the rules of global trade in America\u2019s favor. In the process, he and his top officials have sought to check voters\u2019 expectations as the U.S. presses dozens of countries for new trade deals that many have proved less eager to strike as swiftly as the administration has hoped.",
      "Meanwhile, court rulings have gummed up some of the president\u2019s unprecedented tariff agenda, which economists increasingly say could trigger \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 higher inflation alongside lower growth and higher unemployment.",
      "Trump is also grappling with pushback on his massive agenda bill from Elon Musk \u2014 previously his highest-profile and most-well-resourced ally \u2014 after the tech titan called the bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d Tuesday. NBC News reported Wednesday that House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump is \u201cnot happy\u201d about Musk\u2019s \u201c180\u201d on his agenda. Trump has not directly commented on Musk\u2019s comments.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office now projects the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.",
      "Trump has brushed aside the concerns, using the presidential bully pulpit to assign blame to those he perceives as obstacles to his economic agenda \u2014 messages that senior administration officials are amplifying.",
      "\u201cThe President did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, which is putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week about his meeting with Powell. \u201cThe President\u2019s been very vocal about that, both publicly and now I can reveal privately as well.\u201d",
      "Forthcoming economic data may fan the president\u2019s frustrations anew. Analysts expect fresh federal jobs data later this week to show 125,000 U.S. job gains last month, fewer than the 177,000 added in April. That report is due for release Friday morning, a day after the European Central Bank is widely expected to lower rates again when it updates its monetary policy on Thursday.",
      "But Europe\u2019s economic outlook is far more uncertain than that of the United States. Inflation in the Euro area now hovers below the ECB\u2019s target of 2% as the bloc has grown just 0.3% in the first quarter. Typically the economic engine of the region, Germany has contracted for two years in a row and trade tension could make matters worse. In general, E.U. growth has been hit by weaker energy prices, slower wage growth, and a strengthening currency that have all put pressure on business activity.",
      "By contrast, Goldman Sachs expects U.S. GDP to expand by more than 3% in the second quarter.",
      "If Trump has been frustrated so far, he may still hold some cards that allows him to see his agenda through \u2014 though it may involve relenting on some key issues. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller \u2014 a Trump appointee \u2014 gave an updated view of the current economic landscape.",
      "\u201cAs of today, I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025,\u201d Waller said Monday at a conference in South Korea, \u201cbut how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves.\u201d"

      "PARIS \u2014 Coco Gauff overcame 10 double-faults and the first set she's dropped in the tournament to beat Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 at the French Open on Wednesday, reaching the semifinals for the third time.",
      "It was a contest filled with plenty of mistakes by both Americans, who each has claimed one major championship. They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.",
      "Nearly half of the games \u2014 14 of 29 \u2014 featured breaks of serve. But from 4-all in the second set, Gauff held four times in a row while reeling off eight of the match's last nine games. She made two unforced errors in the last set, including just one double-fault.",
      "The No. 2-seeded Gauff won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open. She'll play Thursday for a berth in another Grand Slam final, facing either No. 6 Mirra Andreeva or 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Lo\u00efs Boisson.",
      "The other women's semifinal is quite a matchup: three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek vs. No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka. They advanced with quarterfinal victories Tuesday.",
      "It was Swiatek who stopped Gauff at Roland-Garros in the semifinals last year and in the final three years ago.",
      "\"I have a lot more work left to do,\" said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, \"but I'm going to savor this one today.\"",
      "Gauff began particularly poorly, trailing 4-1 and twice standing just one point from a 5-1 deficit. Gauff bowed her head or sighed after some miscues. Then, suddenly, she got going, using her speed and instincts to stretch points until Keys \u2014 the Australian Open champion in January \u2014 missed.",
      "That helped Gauff get within a point of taking that set. But the 21-year-old based in Florida double-faulted three times in the tiebreaker, and soon was headed to the locker room to regroup.",
      "That set was sloppy. Gauff had seven winners to 21 unforced errors. Keys has 12 winners to 28 unforced errors, 19 of which arrived from her powerful forehand.",
      "\"Her forehand is probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 on tour. I was just trying my best to get it on the other side of the court,\" Gauff said. \"I knew that I just had to be able to run today and as soon as the ball came short, just punish her for it.\"",
      "Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys that against plenty of other players would end the point. And often enough, it worked well, leading to a miss by Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.",
      "\"With her ability to cover the court,\" Keys said, \"you're going to have to win the point multiple times before it's actually over.\"",
      "The crowd offered more support to Gauff. There were chants in English of \"Let's go, Coco! Let's go!\" and in French of \"Allez, Coco!\"",
      "She ended Keys' 11-match Grand Slam winning streak and now can continue her own pursuit of a second major trophy."

    "summary": "Edmund White, the groundbreaking man of letters who documented and imagined the gay revolution through journalism, essays, plays and novels has died. He was 85.",
    "story": [
      "Edmund White, the groundbreaking man of letters who documented and imagined the gay revolution through journalism, essays, plays and such novels as \"A Boy's Own Story\" and \"The Beautiful Room is Empty,\" has died. He was 85.",
      "White's death was confirmed Wednesday by his agent, Bill Clegg, who did not immediately provide additional details.",
      "Along with Larry Kramer, Armistead Maupin and others, White was among a generation of gay writers who in the 1970s became bards for a community no longer afraid to declare its existence. He was present at the Stonewall raids of 1969, when arrests at a club in Greenwich Village led to the birth of the modern gay movement, and for decades was a participant and observer through the tragedy of AIDS, the advance of gay rights and culture and the backlash of recent years.",
      "A resident of New York and Paris for much of his adult life, he was a novelist, journalist, biographer, playwright, activist, teacher and memoirist. \"A Boy's Own Story\" was a bestseller and classic coming-of-age novel that demonstrated gay literature's commercial appeal. He wrote a prizewinning biography of playwright Jean Genet and books on Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud. He was a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, where colleagues included Toni Morrison and his close friend, Joyce Carol Oates. He was an encyclopedic reader who absorbed literature worldwide while returning yearly to such favorites as Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" and Henry Green's \"Nothing.\"",
      "\"Among gay writers of his generation, Edmund White has emerged as the most versatile man of letters,\" cultural critic Morris Dickstein wrote in The New York Times in 1995. \"A cosmopolitan writer with a deep sense of tradition, he has bridged the gap between gay subcultures and a broader literary audience.\"",
      "The age of AIDS, and beyond",
      "In early 1982, just as the public was learning about AIDS, White was among the founders of Gay Men's Health Crisis, which advocated AIDS prevention and education. The author himself would learn that he was HIV-positive in 1985, and would remember friends afraid to be kissed by him, even on the cheek, and parents who didn't want him to touch their babies.",
      "White survived, but watched countless peers and loved ones suffer agonizing deaths. Out of the seven gay men, including White, who formed the influential writing group the Violet Quill, four died of complications from AIDS. As White wrote in his elegiac novel \"The Farewell Symphony,\" the story followed a shocking arc: \"Oppressed in the fifties, freed in the sixties, exalted in the seventies and wiped out in the eighties.\"",
      "But in the 1990s and after he lived to see gay people granted the right to marry and serve in the military, to see gay-themed books taught in schools and to see gay writers so widely published that they no longer needed to write about gay lives.",
      "\"We're in this post-gay period where you can announce to everybody that you yourself are gay, and you can write books in which there are gay characters, but you don't need to write exclusively about that,\" he said in a Salon interview in 2009. \"Your characters don't need to inhabit a ghetto any more than you do. A straight writer can write a gay novel and not worry about it, and a gay novelist can write about straight people.\"",
      "In 2019, White received a National Book Award medal for lifetime achievement, an honor previously given to Morrison and Philip Roth among others.",
      "\"To go from the most maligned to a highly lauded writer in a half-century is astonishing,\" White said during his acceptance speech.",
      "Childhood yearnings",
      "White was born in Cincinnati in 1940, but age at 7 moved with his mother to the Chicago area after his parents divorced. His father was a civil engineer \"who reigned in silence over dinner as he studied his paper.\" His mother a psychologist \"given to rages or fits of weeping.\" Trapped in \"the closed, sniveling, resentful world of childhood,\" at times suicidal, White was at the same time a \"fierce little autodidact\" who sought escape through the stories of others, whether Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice\" or a biography of the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.",
      "\"As a young teenager I looked desperately for things to read that might excite me or assure me I wasn't the only one, that might confirm my identity I was unhappily piecing together,\" he wrote in the essay \"Out of the Closet, On to the Bookshelf,\" published in 1991.",
      "As he wrote in \"A Boy's Own Story,\" he knew as a child that he was attracted to boys, but for years was convinced he must change \u2014 out of a desire to please his father (whom he otherwise despised) and a wish to be \"normal.\" Even as he secretly wrote a \"coming out\" novel while a teenager, he insisted on seeing a therapist and begged to be sent to boarding school. One of the funniest and saddest episodes from \"A Boy's Own Story\" told of a brief crush he had on a teenage girl, ended by a polite and devastating note of rejection.",
      "\"For the next few months I grieved,\" White writes. \"I would stay up all night crying and playing records and writing sonnets to Helen. What was I crying for?\"",
      "He had a whirling, airborne imagination and New York and Paris had been in his dreams well before he lived in either place. After graduating from the University of Michigan, where he majored in Chinese, he moved to New York in the early 1960s and worked for years as a writer for Time-Life Books and an editor for The Saturday Review. He would interview Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote among others, and, for some assignments, was joined by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.",
      "Socially, he met Burroughs, Jasper Johns, Christopher Isherwood and John Ashbery. He remembered drinking espresso with an ambitious singer named Naomi Cohen, whom the world would soon know as \"Mama Cass\" of the Mamas and Papas. He feuded with Kramer, Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag, an early supporter who withdrew a blurb for \"A Boy's Own Story\" after he caricatured her in the novel \"Caracole.\"",
      "\"In all my years of therapy I never got to the bottom of my impulse toward treachery, especially toward people who'd helped me and befriended me,\" he later wrote.",
      "Early struggles, changing times",
      "Through much of the 1960s, he was writing novels that were rejected or never finished. Late at night, he would \"dress as a hippie, and head out for the bars.\" A favorite stop was the Stonewall, where he would down vodka tonics and try to find the nerve to ask a man he had crush on to dance. He was in the neighborhood on the night of June 28, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall and \"all hell broke loose.\"",
      "\"Up until that moment we had all thought homosexuality was a medical term,\" wrote White, who soon joined the protests. \"Suddenly we saw that we could be a minority group \u2014 with rights, a culture, an agenda.\"",
      "Before the 1970s, few novels about openly gay characters existed beyond Vidal's \"The City and the Pillar\" and James Baldwin's \"Giovanni's Room.\" Classics such as William Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\" had \"rendered gay life as exotic, marginal, even monstrous,\" according to White. But the world was changing, and publishing was catching up, releasing fiction by White, Kramer, Andrew Holleran and others.",
      "White's debut novel, the surreal and suggestive \"Forgetting Elena,\" was published in 1973. He collaborated with Charles Silverstein on \"The Joy of Gay Sex,\" a follow-up to the bestselling \"The Joy of Sex\" that was updated after the emergence of AIDS. In 1978, his first openly gay novel, \"Nocturnes for the King of Naples,\" was released and he followed with the nonfiction \"States of Desire,\" his attempt to show \"the varieties of gay experience and also to suggest the enormous range of gay life to straight and gay people \u2014 to show that gays aren't just hairdressers, they're also petroleum engineers and ranchers and short-order cooks.\"",
      "With \"A Boy's Own Story,\" published in 1982, he began an autobiographical trilogy that continued with \"The Beautiful Room is Empty\" and \"The Farewell Symphony,\" some of the most sexually direct and explicit fiction to land on literary shelves. Heterosexuals, he wrote in \"The Farewell Symphony,\" could \"afford elusiveness.\" But gays, \"easily spooked,\" could not \"risk feigning rejection.\"",
      "His other works included \"Skinned Alive: Stories\" and the novel \"A Previous Life,\" in which he turns himself into a fictional character and imagines himself long forgotten after his death. In 2009, he published \"City Boy,\" a memoir of New York in the 1960s and '70s in which he told of his friendships and rivalries and gave the real names of fictional characters from his earlier novels. Other recent books included the novels \"Jack Holmes & His Friend\" and \"Our Young Man\" and the memoir \"Inside a Pearl: My Years in Paris.\"",
      "\"From an early age I had the idea that writing was truth-telling,\" he told The Guardian around the time \"Jack Holmes\" was released. \"It's on the record. Everybody can see it. Maybe it goes back to the sacred origins of literature \u2014 the holy book. There's nothing holy about it for me, but it should be serious and it should be totally transparent.\""

      "MIAMI \u2014 The woeful Colorado Rockies have ended their ignominious, record-setting MLB streak of 22 consecutive series losses, which dated to last season.",
      "A nervy 3-2 victory at Miami on Tuesday night, highlighted by Hunter Goodman's third home run in two games, gave Colorado two straight victories over the Marlins to ensure the Rockies would leave town with their first series victory since taking two of three games from Arizona in Denver in mid-September.",
      "\"That was big-time for the boys, to get that first series win,\" Rockies interim manager Warren Schaeffer said. \"Who would've known it wouldn't come until June. But the time is now. I'm happy for them.\"",
      "Colorado, a major league-worst 11-50, won consecutive games for just the second time this year after beating Atlanta on April 30 and San Francisco the next day. They go for a series sweep against the Marlins on Wednesday.",
      "Goodman called the Rockies' recent form \"more encouraging than discouraging.\"",
      "\"We had some rough games in the first part of the year, and being able to just be in ballgames and have a chance to win is always better than just not being in it,\" he said.",
      "Goodman's teammates seemed unsurprised by his pivotal role in securing the Rockies' first series win of the season.",
      "\"He's just raking, and when he's hot, he's one of the best hitters in the game,\" centerfielder Brenton Doyle told Rockies.tv. \"I hope he keeps it up. He's one of my good buddies and that was awesome.\"",
      "Rockies reliever Seth Halvorsen earned his third save, but only after Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez drove his 1-1 pitch about 400 feet to left center, where Doyle made a game-ending, running catch at the wall.",
      "\"I'm not going to lie; off the bat, I thought that was a homer,\" Schaeffer said. \"But it wasn't, so it's all good. It's the best having (Doyle) in center field.\"",
      "Excluding one-game series, the Rockies are the fourth team since MLB expansion in 1961 to go 18 series before recording their first series win in a season. The 1987 Padres, 1969 Montreal Expos and 1962 Washington Senators all won their first series of those seasons in their 19th series.",
      "Before the Rockies arrived in Miami, they'd gone 3-28 on the road \u2014 the worst road mark at that point of season in more than a century \u2014 and had not won back-to-back road games since last Sept. 5-6.",
      "\"It's nice to get a couple wins. It's good to get that first series win,\" Schaeffer said. \"Now we just move forward.\""

    "summary": "A federal judge on Tuesday ruled the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ruled the U.S. Bureau of Prisons must keep providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office to halt funding for such care.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., allowed a group of more than 2,000 transgender inmates in federal prisons to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action. He ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide them with hormone therapy and accommodations such as clothing and hair-removal devices while the lawsuit plays out.",
      "The ruling does not require the bureau to provide surgical care related to gender transitions.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said the Trump administration expects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute.",
      "\u201cThe District Court\u2019s decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women\u2019s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders,\u201d Fields said in an email.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the inmates, said the ruling was \u201ca critical reminder to the Trump administration that trans people, like all people, have constitutional rights that don\u2019t simply disappear because the president has decided to wage an ideological battle.\u201d",
      "About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. About two-thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men\u2019s prisons.",
      "The named plaintiffs, two transgender men and one transgender woman, sued the Trump administration in March to challenge Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order aimed at combating what the administration called \u201cgender ideology extremism.\u201d",
      "The executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; and house transgender women in men\u2019s prisons. It also ordered the bureau to stop spending any money on \u201cany medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said in Tuesday\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment that its own medical staff had previously deemed to be medically appropriate for the inmates.",
      "Even if it had extensively studied the issue before deciding to stop gender-affirming care, the decision might still violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment\u2019s protections against \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment, Lamberth wrote.",
      "The Department of Justice had argued that the judge should defer to the policy decision of a democratically elected president, but Lamberth said a functioning democracy requires respect for \u201call duly enacted laws,\u201d including those that blocked the executive branch from acting in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner.",
      "Democratic self-governance \u201cdoes not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election-victor,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The executive order said it was meant to promote the \u201cdignity, safety, and wellbeing of women, and to stop the spread of \u201cgender ideology\u201d which denies \u201cthe immutable biological reality of sex.\u201d But the inmates receiving hormone treatments had little interest in promoting any ideology, and were instead taking \u201cmeasures to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria,\u201d Lamberth wrote."

    "summary": "\u201cState of Firsts,\u201d a documentary about Sarah McBride\u2019s election as the first openly transgender member of Congress, will be premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.",
    "story": [
      "When Rep. Sarah McBride, the nation\u2019s first openly transgender member of Congress, said in November that she would comply with a policy from House Republicans that banned her from using public women\u2019s restrooms in the House, many in the transgender community were disappointed \u2014 and some even furious.",
      "Some people expected McBride, as the only trans member of Congress, to fight more, especially given efforts by state Republicans and the Trump administration to roll back trans rights.",
      "In \u201cState of Firsts,\u201d a documentary about McBride\u2019s election that will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on Saturday, McBride says the criticism from some in her own community hurt but that she felt she would be giving in to Republicans by responding in a way that made her less effective at her job.",
      "\u201cI also think people misunderstand the difference between activists and elected officials and the roles that those respective jobs play in social change and social movement,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you disagree with that, there would be a bounty on my head if I said that I would not comply.\u201d",
      "The documentary explores the unique pressures McBride faced entering Congress. It provides some of the first glimpses at how the bathroom resolution and the criticism from her own community has affected her, and it addresses questions about the limits and challenges of representation and of being a historic \u201cfirst\u201d in federal office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to tell a simple story about a first or about a person\u2019s experience, but you don\u2019t get many lessons learned from simple stories,\u201d McBride told NBC News ahead of the documentary\u2019s premiere. \u201cMy motivation in agreeing to this was to hopefully help chronicle what it was truly like \u2026 so that others who come after me can maybe pull from some of the lessons and some of the experiences, so that their experience is maybe a little bit easier or they can do it a little bit better.\u201d",
      "Being first isn\u2019t necessarily new for McBride. She became the first out trans woman to work in the White House when she interned with the Obama administration, according to her 2018 memoir, \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.\u201d Then, in 2016, she became the first trans person to speak at a major political convention when she gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention. In 2020, she became the country\u2019s first openly trans state senator.",
      "Though McBride had an idea of what it was like to be a \u201cfirst,\u201d she entered Congress at an unprecedented time for trans people, as dozens of states have enacted restrictions on the bathrooms trans people can use in schools and government buildings and their access to transition-related care and school sports.",
      "The documentary also shows how the Democratic Party has been fractured both by the conservative campaign to restrict trans rights and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "The documentary shows McBride knocking on constituents\u2019 doors before the Democratic primary election in Delaware in September. McBride asks a constituent whether she can count on their support, and the constituent says, \u201cThe only thing that would dissuade us from voting for you is can we count on you to call for a ceasefire?\u201d McBride responds that she has called for a ceasefire, and the constituent asks, \u201cHow much can we count on you to be vocal about it?\u201d before becoming emotional and saying it\u2019s hard to see images of kids who \u201clook like our kid.\u201d (The film also shows the reporter of this article asking McBride about the interaction in an interview.)",
      "Chase Joynt, the documentary\u2019s director, said it was important for him to show that moment not only because it revealed an important issue for one of McBride\u2019s constituents, but also because it spoke to a larger theme of the film: that much of the public expected McBride to be an activist, even though that isn\u2019t who she has been for most of her political career as a progressive Democrat largely in line with the party\u2019s platform.",
      "\u201cOne of the central tensions in the film and of this political moment are the frictions between activist and electoral strategies of social change and the pressures put on politicians, in particular, to make statements and make claims and to be constantly negotiating what\u2019s at stake in all of those moves,\u201d Joynt said.",
      "The documentary delves into the LGBTQ community\u2019s complex response to McBride\u2019s becoming a \u201cfirst.\u201d It includes audio from Slate\u2019s \u201cOutward\u201d podcast, in which writer Jules Gill-Peterson says, \u201cThis first elected representative is really not one that it seems like many trans people are going to get excited about, given some of her policy positions and the way that she\u2019s sort of aligned with the party establishment.\u201d",
      "Co-host Christina Cauterucci, a Slate editor, responds: \u201cI think she\u2019s had to be like that. I think a trans person who was more radical in any sense just simply would not have achieved what she\u2019s achieved.\u201d",
      "Joynt said he hopes the documentary encourages people to think about the potentials and limitations of representation in political office.",
      "\u201cWe can expand that conversation to think about a politics of representation that requires trans people to be good, that requires trans people to be palatable, to be on the right side, whatever that might mean, of certain issues,\u201d Joynt said.",
      "Joynt said one of the \u201cperils\u201d of coverage of political figures, particularly those who are \u201cfirsts,\u201d is that \u201cwe put a lot of pressure on individual people to represent all of the various issues and needs,\u201d when, in reality, no one person of any identity can represent all relevant views.",
      "McBride said that with this film, she wants people to see more than just headlines and short video clips. She wants them to get a glimpse of the tradeoffs and challenges \u2014 as well as the joy and humor \u2014 that come with being a first in Congress.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to forget the fullness of who people are and the complexities that every single person is navigating and often the impossible choices that people have to make,\u201d she said.",
      "She added that, since the bathroom resolution, she has become \u201cmore confident now than I have ever been that the approach that I am taking since getting to Congress is working.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of my colleagues realized that I\u2019m just not fun,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give them the response that they want, because I always knew that this was not about their actual, genuine distaste for trans people, it\u2019s because they wanted attention, and because I refuse to let them use me as a pawn, the reality show has moved on to other free gimmicks.\u201d"

      "Kern de Gonzalez, who lived in his husband's childhood home since March 2024, said that he and Joss were regularly at odds with their neighbors, including Ceja, in recent years.",
      "He claims that many neighbors would hurl anti-gay slurs at them and complain about them being \"loud,\" making them feel unwanted in the neighborhood.",
      "Police were called to respond to incidents at their home more than four dozen times, according to call logs obtained by NBC News, with most of the calls labeled as \"disturbances.\"",
      "One of the pair's neighbors, who asked that their name not be shared due to fear of retaliation, said Joss was difficult to live by.",
      "\"He's been a nightmare,\" the neighbor said.",
      "Kern de Gonzales acknowledged that his husband had a tendency to be \"loud.\"",
      "\"Me and Jonathan would be out there late at night playing the drums, singing, being a nuisance,\" Kern de Gonzales said. \"If you're going to make it hard for us to live here, you ain't going to get no sleep.\"",
      "The couple's relationship with Ceja was particularly contentious.",
      "A spokesperson for SAPD confirmed with NBC News that the police department's \"SAFFE\" unit, which works to prevent crimes, had been mediating a dispute between Ceja and Joss for over a year.",
      "In June 2024, Ceja told police that Joss approached his house with a crossbow and hurled racial slurs at him, according to a separate police report. Joss confirmed to police that he walked over to Ceja's house to \"talk about their dogs fighting with each other,\" according to the report.",
      "The report adds that Joss \"got very defensive and stated that he does not bother\" Ceja \"at all.\"",
      "Authorities later searched Joss' home and retrieved a crossbow from his living room, police records say.",
      "And in January, Joss accused Ceja of burning their house down, according to police records.",
      "Joss told police that on the morning of the fire, he was using a barbecue in his living room because he did not have heat or electricity, according to the report. However, he said he turned the barbecue off before leaving the house to get lunch.",
      "He told police that an unnamed individual saw Ceja on his property the day before and suggested Ceja was responsible, according to the report.",
      "\"I have classified this fire to be undetermined in nature at this time but cannot rule out human involvement intentional or unintentional,\" the officer filling out the report wrote.",
      "The fire caused the pair to be homeless, Kern de Gonzales said. But that did not stop them from getting married. They wed on Valentine's Day in Houston.",
      "\"It was a very nice, simple ceremony, you know, just me and him and it, it really suited us,\" he said. \"We were really and really proud to be married.\u201d",
      "Kern de Gonzales said that he and his husband returned to their property on Sunday to retrieve mail. When they arrived, he said they found the skull of a dog on their property. The pair thought the skull belonged to their dog that perished in a fire and was placed there by a neighbor as a way to taunt them.",
      "The incident prompted Joss to march up and down their street with a pitchfork and begin yelling, Kern de Gonzales said.",
      "Several minutes later, he said, Ceja allegedly pulled up to their property and shot Joss.  According to a police report from the Sunday shooting, Ceja told officers, \"I shot him\" upon his arrest on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI could give two f----s less if me or my husband had 50 pitchforks in every orifice of our body rolling up and down that street like tumbleweed,\" he said. \"It don\u2019t matter.\""

      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s largest immigration crackdown yet is underway, but the reallocation of personnel from other federal law enforcement agencies in order to carry out \u201cOperation At Large\u201d is causing tension among some officials who feel they\u2019ve been taken off core national security missions.",
      "The new ICE-led initiative is a response to frustration from White House chief of staff Stephen Miller over what he saw as numbers of arrests and deportations of unauthorized immigrants that were too low. Miller is so frustrated, two sources said, that he has berated and threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin detaining 3,000 migrants a day. He also threatened to fire leaders of field offices posting the bottom 10% of arrest numbers monthly.",
      "This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",

      "\u2192 2,000 Justice Department employees from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and the DEA;",
      "\u2192 500 employees from Customs and Border Protection; and",
      "\u2192 250 IRS agents, some of whom may be used to provide tax information on the whereabouts of immigrants using tax information, and others who would have the authority to make arrests.",
      "The operation is the latest example of how President Donald Trump\u2019s push for mass deportations is reshaping federal law enforcement, leaving less time and attention for other types of criminal investigations.",
      "Now, FBI agents are joining in on immigration-related law enforcement operations, which at one time would have been unusual. DOJ teams focused on other issues are being disbanded so members can dedicate their time to immigration and other administration priorities. Federal courts are regularly seeing misdemeanor cases for border crossings, a rarity in recent years. And federal cases without immigration components have stalled or are moving more slowly.",

And it\u2019s so far-flung that it takes around 25,000 years to complete one orbit around the sun.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just my career kind of started picking up and my brand started growing, and I am in the city at least four times a week, so it\u2019s a lot of back and forth from Jersey.\u201d",
      "Shuffling between the two locations, she said, has been \u201csuper exhausting.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "When Prince Royce released his first hit song, \u201cStand By Me,\u201d in 2010, the singer wasn\u2019t very excited about the moment.",
      "\u201cI was actually bummed out when I recorded 'Stand By Me' because originally I had released a song called \u2018Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara\u2019 that was this song about inner beauty. It was this beautiful song that I had written and I thought was definitely a hit,\u201d Royce, 36, tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd I put that song out, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "His record label suggested three songs to cover, including Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand By Me.\u201d He reluctantly recorded the song but with a Spanglish bachata twist and without any expectations.",
      "The song became a hit, peaking at No. 8 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.",
      "The success of \u201cStand By Me,\u201d Royce says, really opened up a \u201clot of doors for me, and I realized what the power of a cover could do.\u201d",
      "Now, 15 years later, Royce is having a full-circle moment with his latest album, \u201cEterno,\u201d which translates to \"Eternal\" and is a 13-track record of cover songs.",
      "The singer brings his signature sultry bachata sound with the arrangements of classic hits from the Backstreet Boys, Bee Gees, the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Wonder and more \u2014 and yes, they include that Spanglish twist.",
      "\u201cBeing able to bring certain people that remember the song back into their time, and reintroducing the song to a different generation,\u201d he says, \u201cI think that that\u2019s what the concept of this album was, bringing that nostalgia back from the eras of the \u201870s, \u201880s, \u201890s, and reintroducing it to Latin America and to today.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year during Premio Lo Nuestro, Royce teased his album, out now, with a performance medley of the Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\u201d \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love\u201d by Bee Gees and King Harvest\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Moonlight.\u201d",
      "Most recently, Royce and Richard Marx came together to sing the Spanglish version of \u201cRight Here Waiting,\u201d which is included in \u201cEterno.\u201d The moment was captured on Instagram and shows the two artists switching in Spanish and English as they sing a verse and the chorus.",
      "\u201cI love that you\u2019re going to turn a whole other generation on to this song,\u201d Marx says in the video.",
      "\"I'm 100% Latino, Dominican, and also 100% American,\" Royce tells TODAY.com, adding, \u201cThis is so much more than just a covers album. It\u2019s bringing all these cultures together.\u201d",
      "Below, Royce shares his insight into the creation of \u201cEterno,\u201d touring and the growth of bachata in recent decades.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.",
      "What are some of the biggest challenges when selecting the covers for the album?",
      "For me, it was getting educated on, getting very in depth with each song. Who wrote it, what genre was it, when did it come out? What did they do? I like respecting the record.",
      "For the translations, I really wanted to be the closest to the original song, as far as the meaning of what they were trying to say \u2014 and then try to bring in my essence to it. You know, keep some things that I thought were key moments, but bring things that I felt could be different in my style or change it up. That's kind of how I went about each song.",
      "You wrote all the new renditions. Talk to me about the process of putting your personal spin on the songs.",
      "I think it was actually more difficult than doing my own albums because when I'm recording my own song, if I don't like something, I'll just change it. If I don't like a chord, if I don't like a melody, if I don't like a change that they presented to me, I would just change it and then that's it.",
      "Here, I was more forced to stay in the box of what the original song was, because I didn't want to change it too much. I didn't want to be, like, crazy change and people be like, \"Whoa, that wasn't what the song was.\" That'd be maybe an interpolation instead of a cover. That was really more the challenge, which, I like the challenge. I think the challenge was fun to do things with my voice that I normally wouldn't do.",
      "The Backstreet Boys cover of \"I Want It That Way\" is a fun one and more modern. Tell me why you chose that song.",
      "Everything was from back in the day and I said, \"I don't know if this album is about just songs from the '70s or just the '80s. What about something from the '90s?\" It was actually my producer who was like, \"Yo, what about Backstreet?\" And I thought, is that song old enough or is that too recent? But then I Googled it and it's 25 years old.",
      "I think it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s (old) enough to say it\u2019s a classic. And I think that\u2019s been one of the favorites, for real. I feel like a lot of people genuinely have been drawn to that song, and I\u2019m happy I included it because I was reluctant, thinking, \u201cMan, is it too recent in comparison to the other songs?\u201d",
      "Were there any songs that you wanted to cover but weren't able to?",
      "One of the songs was \u201cHuman Nature\u201d by Michael Jackson. I had recorded it and I wasn\u2019t sure if it perfectly fit in there. I decided to just leave it out because I was unsure if it flowed. I keep thinking, \u201cWell, maybe I should have tried something else or tried harder.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s so many artists that were left out. I mean, there\u2019s just thousands of songs. There\u2019s so many ways you can go.",
      "You're planning on going on tour. What can fans expect and what will the songs from this album look like onstage?",
      "There's no tour dates yet, but there should be a tour hopefully by the end of the year.",
      "With every tour and every album, I always bring in hits from all the albums. I am going a little more theatrical with this album. I have 13 music videos and they all kind of connect. It goes a different way than the traditional music video, so I may go a little bit that route for the tour.",
      "In your opinion, what is the state of bachata at the moment and how has it evolved since you released \"Stand By Me\"?",
      "I think it\u2019s always been good. In music and in fashion, anything, there\u2019s always ups and downs. There\u2019s always new trends, new sounds and new artists emerging in the art world, in acting and everything. As for me, as a bachata singer, and not just a singer of the genre but as a person who\u2019s representing it as well, I feel like it\u2019s almost my responsibility to still put that on people\u2019s faces, help (the genre) grow and do collaborations.",
      "In comparison to when I first started, a couple years ago now, I\u2019ve seen it grow to a point where Colombian artists like Manuel Turizo are recording bachata. Shakira, she recorded her first bachata with me, she did another one with Ozuna. Rosal\u00eda sang bachata with The Weeknd. So many artists that aren\u2019t just Dominican \u2014 because at first it was only maybe, like, Dominicans recording bachata. So I think it\u2019s definitely grown into another space where people have been experimenting with it a little more in other countries.",
      "Looking back on the last 15 years, what would you say is the biggest lesson you've learned, professionally or personally?",
      "I\u2019ve learned to have perseverance, to just keep going, to keep swimming. I\u2019ve run two marathons, I\u2019m running a third one, actually, this year. I\u2019ve kind of applied that to life \u2014 like, you got to just keep going. You got to go through the rain, through the fire, through the wind and just keep going. I think that\u2019s how music is. You got to just keep going and keep re-creating and believe in yourself and creating new ideas."

      "As Fallon attempted to start the interview, asking the actor about the last time they saw one another in 30 Rock for the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special, Johnson sat motionless due to her outfit, attempting to hold back laughter.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep my posture real good,\u201d she joked, sitting up straight and requesting a blanket to drape over herself.",
      "Fallon then went behind his desk and pulled out a tissue to give to her. Johnson then situated the tissue inside the dress so her chest was completely covered.",
      "After Fallon suggested she shouldn't \"ruin\" her outfit, Johnson removed the tissue and the interview continued \u2014 with casual dress adjustments and acknowledgements by the actor.",
      "At the end of their conversation, Fallon told Johnson that her dad, Don Johnson, gifted him a cardigan sweater, which he subsequently pulled out from behind the desk.",
      "When Fallon suggested Johnson \u201cborrow\u201d the sweater, she gave him a hard time, saying he probably just didn\u2019t like the cardigan for himself.",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson took the clothing and draped it over her chest, before sitting back into her chair and sighing, \u201cPhew!\u201d"

      "\u201cPeople ask if it ever gets old talking about the same movie for over 30 years. It doesn\u2019t. How could it?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to meet so many amazing people because of it. It\u2019s been passed down through three generations at this point. That\u2019s pretty crazy. Why else would you want to be an actor, director, or filmmaker if not to be part of something that means as much as The Sandlot does to so many people?\u201d",
      "Renna, who came out to thunderous applause from the fans, said getting to play with the Bananas was an amazing experience.",
      "\u201cThis night with the Savannah Bananas reminded me how special being part of this movie is. A night to remember. Even more special was that my 8-year-old was there to see 45,000 people cheer on his pop,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThank you everyone for doing that.\u201d",
      "Renna ended up popping out, but that didn\u2019t detract from the moment. He also told the pitcher, \u201cCome on, DeNunez, you call that the heater?\u201d in a reference to a line in \u201cThe Sandlot.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hit it out of the park,\u201d he wrote. \u201c400 feet is a lot longer than the sandlot was. But, hey, I got a piece! Was it a meatball? Yes. But it was still a 70 MPH meatball. Fine, 63. Whatever who\u2019s counting? Not the point! Is yellow slimming? No, no it\u2019s not. Also not the point!",
      "\u201cThe point is, I just wanted to say that moment meant a whole lot to me, and I just wanted to say thank you to all the people who still love this movie us 9 boys made over 3 decades ago.\u201d",
      "Renna wrapped up his post by hoping he can one day find something else that will resonate with fans the way \u201cThe Sandlot\u201d has.",
      "\u201cHopefully I can continue to entertain you with more projects that mean even a fraction of what \u2018The Sandlot\u2019 has meant,\u201d he wrote.",

      "\"I have to say that as much as the runway show was really fun ... I wasn't nervous. I was aware of my age. I was aware that I'm not a model, and there were a lot of models, and I was just like, 'Am I gonna stick this landing or make an absolute fool myself and embarrass you guys?'\" she said.",

      "She added: \"And when I say 18 years, I mean 33 because I'm still a baby. So I've never felt the burn, you know, and I think for me, like, the burn is everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jenna Bush Hager is overcome by emotion and admits she\u2019s going to cry.",
      "Standing on a stage at the W Nashville at 9 a.m., in front of navy-blue bookshelves created for this moment, Jenna reflects on six years of her book club. Or, as she puts it, \u201cRead With Jenna is in kindergarten!\u201d",
      "The book club started as a dare to prove that people still read \u2014 the festival, which unfolded over May 30 and 31 and was sponsored by Nashville Music City, is proof that she was right.",
      "Since Read With Jenna launched in 2019, Jenna has chosen 80 books and counting, with a focus on championing debut and diverse voices. Fifty books became bestsellers. And 15 of the club\u2019s authors are in the room at the Read With Jenna Book Festival.",
      "The first ever live gathering of Jenna\u2019s book community and authors is the culmination of years of work. But it\u2019s also the product of a lifetime.",
      "Jenna, onstage, talks about the two grandmothers and mother whose love of reading molded her into the woman, and literary tastemaker, she is. She says Jenna Welch, her namesake, read to explore beyond her life in central Texas. Her grandmother Barbara Bush read for connection and enjoyed reading her granddaughters\u2019 selections. Her mother, Laura Bush, a librarian, read for purpose.",
      "You could say Jenna reads for all those reasons \u2014 plus, perhaps, change-making. In addition to bringing people together around her monthly picks, Jenna is starting her own imprint and having a hand in shaping books that go out into the world. (The first book, \u201cConform,\u201d is out later this year.)",
      "At the Read With Jenna Book Festival, audience members experienced the magic of books. While reading is a solitary act, Jenna believes a shared love of books, and the conversation they inspire, can bring people together.",
      "On the morning of May 31, the room was full of about 200 readers from more than 35 states around the country \u2014 cities including Atlanta, Charleston, Chicago, Huntsville, Alabama and of course, Nashville.",
      "Many attendees were friends, like an Elin Hilderbrand-loving duo who met in high school and Amy Sixbey and Cindy Hedges, who met at a yarn store they later co-owned. (Hedges and Sixbey, who are in multiple book clubs each, give advice for running one: Meet once a month and \"read the book.\")",
      "Another woman gave an instant \u201cyes\u201d the moment her sister sent the event\u2019s registration link.",
      "Multiple sets of mothers and daughters at the festival said reading keeps them together even as their lives diverge. \"We communicate through the books we read,\" Patti Grote of Chicago said, next to her grown daughter. \"Bad on Paper\" cohost and novelist Olivia Muenter got her mom tickets for Mother's Day.",
      "Many came by themselves, like one woman who wore Read With Jenna merch she hand-bedazzled for the event \u2014 a jean jacket for the VIP event on Friday and another T-shirt for Saturday\u2019s mainstage. When a 20-year-old couldn't find a friend to join her, she drove by herself.",
      "The day began around 8 a.m. with breakfast and mingling. On the sunny terraces of the W Nashville overlooking Nashville's Gulch district, longtime friends sat side-by-side with solo travelers.",
      "Before events started, and throughout the day, attendees stopped by the many vendors, picking charms to feature on bracelets from local store Charm Bar (cowboy hats and books were popular options), decorating book-shaped cookies from Butterfly Bakehouse, creating a bouquet from Amelia's Flowers, assembling bags of children's books for local libraries and getting their tarot cards read by Sarah Jane Chapman. They also perused pop-ups \u2014 Parnassus Books, the record store Groove and Shop TODAY.",
      "The itinerary was stacked enough to impress a preteen. When Jenna called her eldest daughter Mila to describe the day, Mila responded, \u201cJenna, are you trying to make me jealous?\u201d",
      "Following breakfast came what could only be called a literary marathon. Stepping through the secret door in the bookcase were two bestselling authors, whose chats with Jenna will eventually feature on the Open Book with Jenna podcast.",
      "First, Jenna spoke to \u201cTom Lake\u201d author Ann Patchett about the nun who taught her to read, running a bookstore in Nashville and why she doesn\u2019t have a cell phone.",
      "Jenna also marveled at the full circle moment their conversation represented: At 18, Jenna and her twin Barbara Bush said Donna Tartt and Patchett were their favorite authors \u2014 and now, she was sitting on stage with Patchett. (Patchett said she and Tartt were chuffed by the Bush twins' answer at the time).",
      "From the back of the room, the next speaker, Elin Hilderbrand looked on wearing a white dress that contrasted with her perpetual Nantucket tan. Hilderbrand took the stage after Patchett to discuss whether she\u2019s really retiring, writing with her daughter and how, after 25 years, she\u2019s ushering in a new era: Adaptations.",
      "She and Jenna also shared some news: They are collaborating on a screen project \u2014 but, as Jenna said, \"We can't share much.\" Hilderbrand's fans (\u201cHilderbabes,\" as they're called), will be delighted but not surprised to know that throughout the day of the festival, the best-selling author took breaks out by the pool.",
      "From there, attendees shuffled between the day\u2019s activities. There were interactive book club sessions with Read With Jenna authors Amity Gaige (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), Emma Straub (\u201cAll Adults Here\u201d) and Christina Henriquez (\u201cThe Great Divide\u201d), asking questions about the novels and answering questions about how they were personally moved.",
      "Later came a chance to tap into their creative sides in workshops led by novelist Jessica Soffer (\u201cThis Is a Love Story\u201d) and songwriter Eric Paslay.",
      "After lunch, comedian Tiffany Haddish took the mainstage with Jenna. Haddish got deep, fast, about how her past trauma informs her comedy, and her revelations about her childhood in the foster care system inspired an attendee to share her own story.",
      "One undeniable highlight came when Haddish \u201ccursed\u201d the audience with joy \u2014 \u201cI curse you with all the joy and abundance and success you can handle. You deserve to be happy.\u201d Another unplanned moment came when she and Paslay collaborated on a moving song about her.",
      "The day rounded out with a celebration of what makes Read With Jenna so special: Its authors (who Jenna calls rock stars).",
      "Jenna moderated a panel with multiple Read With Jenna authors (Coco Mellors, Rumaan Alam, Jean Kwok, Alison Espach, and Chris Whitaker, plus a cameo from Mellors\u2019 son, Indigo). Then, lines formed for signings with all the authors in attendance, a list that included Cara Wall, Diane Marie Brown and Tara Stringfellow, too.",
      "Almost 11 hours after the Read With Jenna Book Festival started at 8 a.m., the crowd gathered to listen to singer Blessing Offor perform. (Holly Williams performed with her husband during the VIP event \u2014 it's Music City, after all).",
      "Jenna, overcome yet again, thanked attendees \u2014 and made, if not a firm promise, then the hope of one.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make this an annual pilgrimage. Until then I hope you connect with us,\" she said."

      "The Russian military will likely surpass 1 million casualties in its war on Ukraine this summer, according to one of the world\u2019s leading think tanks, reflecting the staggering human toll of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s assault on his neighbor.",
      "Around 250,000 of these Russian soldiers have died, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)  said in a report Tuesday.",
      "The Ukrainian military has also suffered heavy losses, with 400,000 casualties, including 60,000 to 100,000 soldiers killed, it said.",
      "Surpassing 1 million killed and wounded would be \u201ca stunning\" and grisly milestone for Russia and showed \u201cPutin\u2019s blatant disregard for his soldiers,\u201d according to the report. To put this figure in historical perspective, it is five times as many deaths as all Soviet and Russian wars since World War II.",
      "The figure is stark but roughly tallies with previous estimates given by Western intelligence agencies, which have said that around 1,000 Russian troops are killed or injured every day.",
      "Putin annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula and began supporting pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country in 2014. But the CSIS figures relate to the period starting with the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

    "story": [
      "More than two dozen people were killed early Tuesday after the Israeli military opened fire close to an aid distribution point in southern Gaza, local health officials said, the third time in three days that Palestinians were killed in the area.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed dead and injured being rushed to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. At one point, medical workers gathered around a young child whose head was wrapped in bandages.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Abu Sweid, an Australian emergency physician, told NBC News that patients' injuries included \"multiple gunshot wounds, thoracic injuries to the chest, mangled limbs.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the third such event in the last few days,\u201d he said, describing what he called \u201canother mass casualty event from a food aid center\u201d in Rafah.",
      "\u201cThe hospital\u2019s overwhelmed,\u201d Abu Sweid said.",
      "A 5-year-old girl was among the wounded, he added, before abruptly ending the interview to treat a patient being rushed into the room.",
      "At least 27 people were killed Tuesday and more than 160 injured as they waited for aid at a designated site in the Al-Alam roundabout in the southern city of Rafah, according to health officials in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "NBC News was not immediately able to verify the number of casualties. The World Health Organization has said it considers the Health Ministry\u2019s data reliable.",
      "The Israeli military said its troops had fired what it described as \u201cwarning fire\u201d at a number of people about a half kilometer, or 0.3 miles, away from an aid distribution site in Rafah, and that it was aware of and looking into reports of casualties.",
      "Troops identified several people moving toward them \u201cin such a way that posed a threat to them\u201d and appearing to deviate from designated aid access routes, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cAfter the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops,\u201d it said.",
      "It did not expand on what perceived threat those people posed.",
      "The group in charge of dispensing the aid, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, said that while it was distributed \u201csafely and without incident\" at the Rafah site, it understood that the IDF was investigating whether \"a number of civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area,\u201d the U.S. and Israel-backed group added. \u201cWe recognize the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when traveling to our distribution sites.\u201d",
      "The new effort run by GHF has been condemned by established humanitarian groups, including the U.N. They warn that using a few distribution centers falls drastically short of what is needed and forces many Palestinians to travel long distances to access desperately needed supplies, risking further displacement. It also threatens the independence of humanitarian work while handing Israel more control over Gaza, critics say.",
      "On Monday, Gaza health officials said at least three people were killed and dozens more injured when Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians trying to get to a food distribution site in Rafah.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d to \u201cprevent several suspects approaching them,\u201d adding that the incident took place around 1 kilometer, or 0.6 miles, from a distribution site in the Tel al-Sultan area in Rafah. It said it was aware of reports of casualties and was looking into the incident.",
      "'Dropped to the ground'",
      "On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in a similar event in Rafah, with hundreds injured, according to local health officials and aid workers. Speaking with NBC News' crew on the ground, four witnesses described coming under fire from the air and on the ground while they were waiting to collect aid near a distribution site.",
      "Several witnesses said the violence broke out just before 4 a.m. (9 p.m. Saturday ET), while another said it was around 6 a.m. (11 p.m. Saturday ET). At least three people described shelling from tanks, in addition to gunfire. Only the IDF is known to use tanks in Gaza."

Some 1,000 Palestinians have remained there despite being ordered out, and journalists, human rights activists and diplomats have visited the villages in the past.",
      "Palestinian residents in the area have reported increasing settler violence since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and kickstarted the war in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2014 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",

      "It said in a statement to AP that the structures in the village were built illegally and demolished after the residents had the chance to present their cases against demolition.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. The joint Palestinian-Israeli production was directed by Adra and Hamdan Ballal, another Palestinian activist from Masafer Yatta, along with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",

      "GHF later shared hours of CCTV video appearing to show crowds of Palestinians peacefully collecting aid from one of its distribution centers. It was not immediately clear when and where the video was taken.",
      "\u201cAs noted in our daily report earlier, aid was distributed without incident,\u201d the organization said in a statement accompanying the video. \u201cReports of injuries and fatalities are completely false and fabricated. Please do not be duped by them.\u201d",

      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the GHF initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a long-standing humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en masse to Gaza\u2019s south.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.",
      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",
      "\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said."

      "If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thought that his spectacular drone strike on Russian air bases would yield a Kremlin compromise, Russia issued its blunt response in black and white: no chance.",
      "After waiting for weeks for Moscow to present its ceasefire demands in writing, the West finally got them Monday with a memorandum issued by Russian envoys in Istanbul.",
      "Few analysts really believed that Ukraine\u2019s \u201cSpiderweb\u201d plot would gain immediate concessions from a stubborn President Vladimir Putin. And so it was.",
      "The memorandum, published in full by the Russian state news agency Tass, was less of a peace plan and more a demand for Ukraine to surrender, defang its military and become a vassal of Moscow.",
      "The conditions, which included Ukraine withdrawing from vast swaths of territory and fulfilling a list of Russian-set conditions, put down for the first time on paper what Ukraine and its allies have known since the beginning of this three-year-long war \u2014 that Putin and his forces \u201care going to have to kill their way out of this war,\u201d a Western official with knowledge of the talks told NBC News on Tuesday, predicting \u201cmore violence.\u201d",
      "The handing over by the Russian delegation of such a maximalist list of demands illustrated that \u201cRussia does not negotiate \u2014 except the terms of its opposition\u2019s surrender,\u201d said James Nixey, a London-based consultant specializing on Russia and the former Soviet republics.",
      "Putin\u2019s Kremlin is \u201cnot fighting a war in Ukraine because of some vague ambition; it\u2019s doing it because it thinks that it is God given right,\u201d he added, and \u201cas extraordinary move from the Ukrainians as this was,\u201d Russia is unlikely to yield until it is \u201ccrippled economically and humbled militarily\u201d \u2014 neither of which have happened.",
      "Under the 12-point plan, Russia would control Crimea, the southern peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014, as well as the eastern territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This is where most of the war has been fought since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Russia only controls parts of these areas and so is calling for Ukrainian forces to withdraw \u2014 another colossal loss of territory for the country that was invaded three years ago.",
      "The document calls for Ukraine to downsize its army, accept \u201cneutral\u201d status between Russia and the West, recognize Russian as an official language, and ban the \u201cglorification or promotion of Nazism.\u201d",
      "For many in the West, this is little more than a road map for Ukraine to be swallowed back up by Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, as it was during the Soviet era and then under Kremlin-compliant leaders such as Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014."

      "Coalition partners did not embrace his idea, and had said it was up to the migration minister from Wilders\u2019 own party to work on specific proposals. Wilders was not part of the government himself as its leader or a minister.",
      "He was convicted for discrimination after he insulted Moroccans at a campaign rally in 2014 and only managed to strike a coalition deal with three other conservative parties last year after he gave up his bid to become prime minister.",
      "Instead, the cabinet was led by the independent and unelected Schoof, a career bureaucrat who had led the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD and was the senior official at the ministry of justice."
