      "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy describes his time behind bars in a book released Wednesday",
      "PARIS -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy described the prison where he spent 20 days as a noisy, harsh \u201call-grey\u201d world of \u201cinhuman violence\" in a book released Wednesday that also offered political advice about how his conservative party should appeal to far-right voters.",
      "In \u201cDiary of a Prisoner,\u201d the 70-year-old says his own tough-on-crime stance has taken on a new perspective as he recounts the uncommon turn in his life after being found guilty of criminal association in financing his winning 2007 campaign with funds from Libya.",
      "The court sentenced him in September to five years in prison, a ruling he appealed. He was granted release under judicial supervision after 20 days behind bars.",
      "The book provides a rare look inside Paris\u2019 La Sant\u00e9 prison, where Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement and kept strictly away from other inmates for security reasons. His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",
      "Opening the window on his first day behind bars, he heard an inmate who \u201cwas relentlessly striking the bars of his cell with a metal object.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was threatening. Welcome to hell!\u201d",
      "Sarkozy said he declined the meals served in small plastic trays along with a \u201cmushy, soggy baguette\u201d \u2014 their smell, he wrote, made him nauseous. Instead, he ate dairy products and cereal bars. He was allowed one hour a day in a small gym room, where he mostly used a basic treadmill.",
      "Sarkozy says he was informed of several violent incidents that took place during his time behind bars, which he called \u201ca nightmare.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most inhumane violence was the daily reality of this place,\u201d he wrote, raising questions about the prison system\u2019s ability to reintegrate people once their sentences are served.",
      "Sarkozy, known for his tough rhetoric on punishing criminals, said he promised himself that \u201cupon my release, my comments would be more elaborate and nuanced than what I had previously expressed on all these topics.\u201d",
      "Beyond recounting prison life, Sarkozy used the book to offer strategic political advice for his conservative Republicans party and revealed he spoke by phone from prison with far-right leader Marine Le Pen, once a fierce rival.",

      "Le Pen\u2019s National Rally is \u201cnot a danger for the Republic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe do not share the same ideas when it comes to economic policy, we do not share the same history \u2026 and I note that there may still be some problematic figures among them. But they represent so many French people, respect the results of the elections and participate in the functioning of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Sarkozy argued that the reconstruction of his weakened Republicans party \u201ccan only be achieved through the broadest possible spirit of unity.\u201d",
      "The Republicans party has in recent years been moving away from a position held among parties for decades that any electoral strategy must be aimed at containing the far right, even if it means losing a district to another competitor.",
      "Still, political analyst Roland Cayrol said Sarkozy's comments came like \u201ca thunderclap\u201d in the decades-long position of French conservatives that the National Rally doesn't \"share the same values\u201d and \u201cno electoral alliance is possible\u201d with the far right.",
      "The former president from 2007 to 2012 has been retired from active politics for years but remains very influential, especially in conservative circles.",
      "In the wake of Sarkozy's comments, the Republicans' top officials have stopped short of calling for any actual cooperation deal with the National Rally, but instead indicated they want to focus on ways to get far-right voters to choose conservative candidates.",
      "Sarkozy also mentioned his former friendship with centrist President Emmanuel Macron. The two men met at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e presidential palace just days before Sarkozy entered prison.",
      "According to Sarkozy, Macron raised security concerns at La Sant\u00e9 prison and offered to transfer him to another facility, which he declined. Instead, two police officers were assigned to the neighboring cell to protect him around the clock.",
      "Sarkozy said he lost trust in Macron after the president did not intervene to prevent him from being stripped of the Legion of Honor, France\u2019s highest distinction, in June.",
      "Last month, Sarkozy was convicted of illegal campaign financing of his 2012 reelection bid, in a major blow to his legacy and reputation. He was sentenced to a year in prison, half of it suspended, which he now will be able to serve at home, monitored with an electronic bracelet or other requirements to be set by a judge.",
      "Last year, France's top court upheld an appeals court decision that had found Sarkozy guilty of trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about legal proceedings in which he was involved.",

      "NEW YORK -- Raul Malo, the soulful tenor and frontman of the genre-defying, Grammy-winning band The Mavericks, has died. He was 60.",
      "Malo died Monday night, his wife, Betty Malo, posted on his Facebook page. He had been battling cancer. The frontman of The Mavericks had documented his health journey on social media since he disclosed in June 2024 that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer.",
      "In September 2025, Malo said on Instagram that he was battling LMD, or leptomeningeal disease, a rare complication when cancer spreads to membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.",
      "The diagnosis forced The Mavericks to cancel dates with Dwight Yoakam in the middle of a joint tour. Malo left home in Nashville, Tennessee, to seek treatment in Houston, keeping his fans updated along his health journey.",
      "\u201cHe was called to do another gig \u2014 this time in the sky \u2014 and he\u2019s flying high like an eagle,\u201d Betty Malo wrote. \u201cNo one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music, and adventure the way our beloved Raul did. Now he will look down on us with all that heaven will allow, lighting the way and reminding us to savor every moment.\u201d",
      "Malo\u2019s band praised his deep commitment to the \u201cpreservation of the multilingual American musical repertoire\u201d and his steadfast championing of \u201cmusic education as an inspiration for every child across America and throughout the world.\u201d",
      "Born Raul Francisco Mart\u00ednez-Malo Jr. in Miami to Cuban parents, he co-founded The Mavericks in 1989 with drummer Paul Deakin and bass guitarist Robert Reynolds. Their self-titled debut album was released the following year on the independent, Miami-based label Y&T Music.",
      "Some call the band alt-country. Others describe it as Americana, roots, Latin, Tejano or swing. It\u2019s all of the above and more, driven by songs written by Malo, his expansive guitar style and his broad vocal range, from a soaring, velvety baritone to operatic high notes.",
      "His musical prowess was in the blend, also incorporating rock, traditional country and surf. In the early days in Miami, The Mavericks played punk and rock clubs to get their sound out there.",

      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is dominating the box office in its opening weekend in North America",
      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d has powered up the box office once again. The sequel opened in 3,412 theaters in the U.S. and Canada this weekend and far surpassed expectations with $63 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Seemingly immune to widely negative reviews, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d notched the biggest opening ever for the weekend after Thanksgiving, which usually is a more muted buffet of leftovers. It\u2019s also the biggest opening of the year for a PG-13 rated movie and the second biggest horror opening, behind \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites.\u201d The movies and the game are about a family restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, whose anthropomorphic robots turn murderous at night.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of doom and gloom about the industry overall, but this movie helped drive the industry to the biggest first weekend post-Thanksgiving ever,\" said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal.",
      "The first film, also a Blumhouse production, was a surprise hit two years ago. It opened to $80 million in October 2023, despite also being available to stream on Peacock. Universal decided to open the sequel exclusively in theaters. With a reported production price tag of only $36 million, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is on its way to being another smash. It\u2019s another reminder of the potential massive upside of theatrical releases as many in the industry and out wonder what Netflix\u2019s acquisition of Warner Bros. will mean for moviegoing.",
      "The sequel, written by the game\u2019s creator Scott Cawthon, saw the return of cast members like Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Lail as well as director Emma Tammi. Reviews were dismal, even worse than the first. Mark Kennedy, in his zero star review for The Associated Press, called it an \u201cincoherent mess.\u201d But horror fans have been known to turn out for opening weekends regardless of reviews. This audience had a decidedly more positive take. According to PostTrak polling data, 70% of ticket buyers said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d recommend \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to their friends.",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, the head of marketplace trends for Comscore, said that the teen video gamer audience is sometimes underestimated and this weekend proves once again that given the right film, will come out to the movie theater for that communal experience with fellow fans.",
      "It was also enough to push the more family-friendly \u201cZootopia 2\u201d into second place in its second weekend in theaters, where it added $43 million in North America. But the Disney film isn\u2019t hurting after its record Thanksgiving opening. With $219 million from 52 territories internationally, including China, the running global total is an eye-popping $915.8 million. It's officially pushed Walt Disney Studio releases over the $5 billion mark globally \u2014 the only studio to do so this year.",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d also a Universal release, landed in third place in its third weekend with $16.8 million from 3,985 theaters, brining its domestic total just shy of $297 million.",
      "Fourth place went to Gkids\u2019 anime \u201cJujutsu Kaisen: Execution\u201d which opened to an estimated $10.2 million, while Lionsgate's \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don't\u201d rounded out the top five with $3.5 million, pushing its running global total to $210 million.",
      "\u201cKill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d was close behind with $3.3 million from 1,198 theaters. Quentin Tarantino combined \u201cKill Bill: Vol. 1\" and \u201cVol. 2\u201d into a four hour and 35-minute epic (including a 15 minute intermission). The Lionsgate release got a rare A+ CinemaScore from an audience that was 72% male. According to the studio, most of the 70mm and 35mm showings were sold out. Due to the demand for the film prints, the studio is exploring an extended run. \u201cKill Bill\u201d star Lucy Liu had a big weekend at New York's AMC Lincoln Square where the independent drama \u201cRosemead\u201d made $50,243 from one screen.",
      "A filmed version of the Tony-winning revival of \u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\u201d starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and released by Sony Pictures Classics, opened just outside of the top 10 with $1.2 million from 1,084 screens.",
      "The running annual domestic box office just this weekend surpassed $8 billion. Since the pandemic, it's only surpassed $9 billion once, in 2023, when \u201cBarbie\u201d topped the year. Prior to 2020, it would regularly hit $11 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but every movie is going to have to overperform in some way if we\u2019re going to get to the $9 billion threshold,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- Hungarian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, who won the Nobel Prize in literature for his surreal and anarchic novels that combine a bleak world view with mordant humor, gave a lecture in Stockholm on Sunday in one of his rare public appearances.",
      "The lecture was part of the Nobel week that is underway in Stockholm and Oslo with laureates holding news conferences and giving speeches before they are awarded the prestigious prizes.",
      "Krasznahorkai's lecture, which he gave in Hungarian, ranged across topics such as old and new angels, human dignity, hope or the lack thereof, rebellion and his observations of a clochard \u2014 or tramp \u2014 on the Berlin subway.",
      "He introduced his lecture, according to the English translation, by saying that \u201con receiving the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, I originally wished to share my thought with you on the subject of hope, but as my stores of hope have definitely come to an end, I will now speak about angels.\u201d",
      "As opposed to \u201cthe angels of old,\u201d the new angels, Krasznahorkai said, \u201chave no wings, but they also have no message, none whatsoever. They are merely here among us in their simple street clothes, unrecognizable if they so wish.",
      "\u201cThey just stand there and look at us, they are searching for our gaze, and in this search there is a plea for us, to look into their eyes, so that we ourselves can transmit a message to them, only that unfortunately, we have no message to give,\u201d the author writes in sad, yet poetic prose.",
      "Expressing himself in his long, winding trademark sentences full of apocalypse but without full stops, he says it comes as a shock when he \u201cdetects the horrific story of these new angels that stand before me, the story that they are sacrifices, sacrifices: and not for us, but because of us, for every single one of us, because of every single one of us, angels without wings and angels without a message, and all the while knowing that there is war, war and only war, war in nature, war in society, and this war is being waged not only with weapons, not only with torture, not only with destruction: of course, this is one end of the scale, but this war proceeds at the opposite of the scale as well, because one single bad word is enough.\u201d",
      "When the Nobel judges announced the award for Krasznahorkai in October, they described the 71-year-old as \u201ca great epic writer\u201d whose work \u201cis characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess.\u201d",
      "\u201cKrasznahorkai\u2019s work can be seen as part of a Central European tradition,\" the Nobel Prize organization said. \u201dImportant features are pessimism and apocalypse, but also humor and unpredictability.\"",

Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year.

      "Paramount has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros",
      "NEW YORK -- Paramount on Monday launched a hostile takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, initiating a potentially bruising battle with rival bidder Netflix to buy the company behind HBO, CNN and a famed movie studio along with the power to reshape much of the nation's entertainment landscape.",
      "Emerging just days after top Warner managers agreed to Netflix's $72 billion purchase, the Paramount bid seeks to go over the heads of those leaders by appealing directly to Warner shareholders with more money \u2014 $74.4 billion \u2014 and a plan to buy all of Warner's business, including the cable business that Netflix does not want.",
      "Paramount said its decision to go hostile came after it made several earlier offers that Warner management \u201cnever engaged meaningfully\u201d with following the company's October announcement that it was open to selling itself.",
      "In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount noted its offer also contains more cash than Netflix's bid \u2014 $18 billion more \u2014 and argued that it's more likely to pass scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration, a big concern given his habit of injecting himself in American business decisions.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump said the Netflix-Warner combo \u201ccould be a problem\u201d because of the size of the combined market share and that he planned to review the deal personally.",
      "For its part, Netflix says it is confident Warner will reject the Paramount bid and that regulators, and Trump, will back its deal, citing multiple conversations that co-CEO Ted Sarandos has had with him about the streaming company's expansion and hiring.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s interest in this is the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said Monday at an investor conference.",
      "The fight for Warner drew strong reaction in Washington, with politicians from both major parties weighing in on the likely impact on streaming prices, movie theater employment and the diversity of entertainment choices and political views.",
      "Paramount, run by David Ellison, whose family is closely allied with Trump, said it had submitted six proposals to Warner over a 12-week period before the latest offer.",
      "\u201cWe believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood. It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theater industry,\" the Paramount CEO said in a statement. Ellison added that his deal would lead to more competition in the industry, not less, and more movies in theaters.",
      "A regulatory document released Monday suggested another possible Paramount advantage to win over Trump: An investment firm run by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would be investing in the deal, too.",
      "Also participating would be funds controlled by the governments of three unnamed Persian Gulf countries, widely reported as Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Trump's family company has struck deals this year for buildings and resorts that bear his name in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, partnering in the former with a company closely tied to the government and in the latter with the government fund itself.",
      "Also possibly in Paramount's favor are recent changes at CBS News since its October purchase of the news and commentary website The Free Press. The site's founder, Bari Weiss, who has a reputation for fighting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, was then installed as editor-in-chief in a signal Ellison intended to shake up the storied network of Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and \u201c60 Minutes,\" long viewed by many conservatives as the personification of a liberal media establishment.",
      "Still, Trump is a wild card given his tendency to make decisions based on gut and his personal mood.",

      "The drama surrounding control of Warner began Friday when Netflix made the surprise announcement that it had struck a deal with its management to buy the Hollywood giant behind \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d HBO Max and DC Studios.",
      "The cash and stock proposal was valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt that will be assumed in the deal. By contrast, the Paramount offer is for $30 per Warner share, and worth $108 billion, included assumed debt. Paramount\u2019s offer is set to expire on Jan. 8 unless it\u2019s extended.",
      "But comparing the two deals is complicated because they are not buying the same thing. The Netflix offer, if it goes through, will only close after Warner completes its previously announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal, which is unlikely to close for at least a year, are networks such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "The federal government has the authority to kill any big media deals if it has antitrust concerns, but such matters are usually left to experts at the Department of Justice. In his decision to get involved personally, Trump has decided, as he has with other government norms, to make a sharp break with precedent.",
      "That worries Usha Haley, a Wichita State University specialist in international business strategy, who noted that Ellison is the son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, the world\u2019s second-richest person.",
      "\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to be involved in the decision. We should take him at face value,\u201d Haley said of Trump. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s just greater control over the media.\"",
      "But others are uncertain how big a role Trump will play.",
      "John Mayo, an antitrust expert at Georgetown University, said the scrutiny will be serious whichever offer is approved by shareholders and goes before the DOJ, and that he thinks experts there will keep partisanship out of their decisions despite the politically charged atmosphere.",
      "\u201cThat may affect at least the rhetoric that occurs in the press,\" he said, \"though I doubt it will affect the analysis that occurs at the Department of Justice.\u201d",

      "Here\u2019s a collection of reactions to this year\u2019s Globes nominations. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cThe biggest lesson for me, and it\u2019s gonna sound cheesy, but the biggest lesson is just how much I love my job. Professionally I\u2019m married to cinema, and this movie felt like I was renewing my vows, if that makes sense.",
      "\u201cThis is the best that I\u2019ve ever seen (star Michael B. Jordan). It's crazy to say, because he\u2019s got some pretty substantial roles in pop culture. But I had this feeling that this was the best I had ever seen him in both these roles. I think this was a role that he could only play now with this level of experience at this age. And I\u2019m just so incredibly proud of him.\u201d \u2014 in an Associated Press interview. Coogler was nominated as both director and producer.",
      "I happened to wake up at 5:30. I went to check my phone and my phone was dead. So then I was trying to figure out how to get a charger and charge my phone before I could even get into contact with my family or with my team. ... I feel so lucky that I get the opportunity to to tell an incredible story like this one. I feel so lucky to be where I am at 25, and I\u2019m in the midst of living my dream. I\u2019m still processing the fact that I even get to be here.\u201d \u2014 in an AP interview. Infiniti is nominated for best female actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy.",
      "\u201cThe film is a tightrope. The character is a film, and the film is a character. So I\u2019d never done that before in a feature and it was extraordinary to have that opportunity to try. It has changed me creatively, and has stretched me in a way that I\u2019d never had the opportunity to before.\u201d \u2014 in an AP interview. Byrne is nominated for best female actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy.",
      "\u201cOn having \u201cWicked\u201d made into two feature films: This is something that all of us involved with the show have always talked about. It was a natural progression to start reconceiving how we would tell the story in cinematic terms. We just got very lucky with the people who helped us to tell that story ... particularly (director) Jon M. Chu, whose vision and guidance has been extraordinary. And I feel these two movies together are a really remarkable achievement on Jon's part that I think will be recognized over the years and stand the test of time.\u201d \u2014 in an AP interview. Schwartz is nominated in the best song category for both \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d and \u201cThe Girl in the Bubble.\u201d",
      "(On collaborating with director and co-writer Chlo\u00e9 Zhao): \"You know, the book is mine, it\u2019s my baby, but the film is Chlo\u00e9's adaptation. And the film feels not like my child, more like a kind of niece or nephew. And that\u2019s exactly as it should be.",
      "\u201cChlo\u00e9 is an amazing leaver of voice notes. I would wake up in Scotland and turn on my phone and there would be a series of pings, just ping ping ping ping ping \u2014 sometimes 12, sometimes 13 voice notes, some of which were 20 seconds long, and the longest ever, which I wrote down because I knew I wouldn\u2019t believe it, it was 58 minutes. It was a veritable podcast.\u201d \u2014 in an AP interview. O'Farrell, author of the novel \u201cHamnet,\u201d was nominated for best screenplay, along with Zhao.",

      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- In a theater where a suicide bomber detonated years ago, Hassan Barre stepped forward to offer a different hallmark of Somalia: poetry.",
      "In one of the world's most volatile nations, Somalis must be aware of their responsibility to their country and each other, he said in a recital emphasizing good citizenship.",
      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush. Somalis, after all, are often described as \"a nation of poets.\" Their work often venerates pastoral well-being and the traditional roles of men and women in the predominantly Islamic society.",
      "Some poets like Hadraawi \u2014 the \u201cShakespeare of Somalia\u201d who died in 2022 \u2014 have achieved universal recognition. \u201cHadraawi\u2019s oeuvre includes a broad repertoire, from love songs to laments of war,\u201d Harvard University's Archive of World Music noted after his death.",
      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",
      "On the morning Hassan Barre sang his poem, a group of young Somalis were practicing a folk dance that emphasized traditional values, like dutifully cultivating the land. A group of poets, including one woman, sat nearby, talking quietly.",
      "Some told The Associated Press they are trying to keep Somalia\u2019s poetic tradition alive despite security concerns and financial challenges that limit programming.",
      "Traditional poets still perform at community gatherings like weddings, and poems are recited daily on local radio stations.",

We expect them to treat us the way we used to be treated.\u201d",
      "Daud Aweis, Somalia's culture minister, said poets still play \u201ca vital role in Somali society, serving as a foundational pillar for cultural vitality, individual well-being and peaceful coexistence.\" While his ministry provides limited funding for culture and the arts at the National Theater, \"the long-term goal is to expand support,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Inaugurated in 1967, less than a decade after independence, the National Theater shut down in 1991 following Barre's ouster. It reopened in 2012 after African Union peacekeepers pushed al-Shabab fighters out of Mogadishu in a counter-terrorism campaign.",
      "Months later, however, a suicide bomber blew herself up at the theater during a speech by the prime minister, killing the head of Somalia\u2019s Olympic committee and at least seven others. The prime minister survived.",
      "Still, the poets who meet at the National Theater are not giving up. Gathering there fosters a sense of community in a sandbagged city ringed by checkpoints.",
      "Hirsi Dhuuh Mohamed, who chairs the Somali Council of Poets, said the group has 400 members, including many in the diaspora. He said things had improved from \u201cthe worst\u201d in the late 1990s, when Mogadishu was divided into zones as warlords fought for dominance.",
      "\"One thing that unites all Somali poets, whether in Eritrea, whether in Somalia, everywhere, we stand for peace,\u201d he said, adding that they never engage directly in politics. Instead, he said, the overarching message of their work is security, good governance and community integration.",
      "Another poet, Maki Haji Banaadir, a curmudgeon with gold-rimmed glasses, is among those trying to keep the National Theater operational as its deputy director.",
      "In 2003, he and six other poets traveled across Somalia to preach reconciliation. That kind of journey is impossible now. The federal government has little hold on territory outside of Mogadishu, and at least two semi-autonomous regions are seeking secession.",
      "Maki, as he is commonly known, is a popular cultural figure in Somalia. A decade ago, he composed a song about the apparent uselessness of the Somali shilling, which is no longer accepted in local markets amid the dollarization of Somalia\u2019s economy.",
      "Asked if he and his peers were grooming the next generation of Somali poets, he said he hoped so: \u201cWe are working day and night.\"",

      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

That's put both the name of New York City's incoming mayor and the famed Paris museum on a list of the most mispronounced words in 2025.",

      "The theft of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre in October had many people mispronouncing the name of the world\u2019s most-visited museum. Babbel says the correct pronunciation is LOOV-ruh, with a very soft pronunciation on the \u201cruh,\u201d which can be a challenge for English speakers.",

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "\u201cIt was not very pleasant to be vaccinated with,\u201d Shine recalled. \u201cThere were a lot of side effects, like big welts where you got vaccinated and a little bit of pain.\u201d",
      "Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",
      "\u201cIt's really wonderful. I read a couple each day,\" she said. \u201cEvery single one of them makes you want to cry.\u201d",

      "\u201cDeath cap mushrooms contain potentially deadly toxins that can lead to liver failure,\" Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement. \u201cBecause the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season.\u201d",
      "One adult has died and several patients have required intensive care, including at least one who might need a liver transplant.",
      "Wet weather fuels the growth of death cap mushrooms, and officials warn against any wild mushroom foraging to avoid confusion. Residents in central California's Monterey County became ill after eating mushrooms found in a local park, according to county health officials. Another cluster of cases were in the San Francisco Bay Area, but state health officials warned that the risk is everywhere.",

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",

      "The prime minister hailed the country's transformation in a parliamentary address in late October. The capital, Addis Ababa, has seen a development boom. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was inaugurated in July. Abiy has called it a \u201charbinger of tomorrow\u2019s dawn\u201d that will end the reliance on foreign aid for Africa's second most populous nation. The country has been one of the world's biggest aid recipients.",
      "But multiple challenges lie ahead that could badly damage the economy, which has seen some of the strongest growth on the continent.",

      "In June, Eritrea accused Ethiopia of having a \u201clong-brewing war agenda\u201d aimed at seizing its Red Sea ports. Ethiopia insists it wants to gain sea access peacefully.",

      "Magus Taylor, deputy Horn of Africa director at the International Crisis Group, described the tensions as concerning.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility of mistakes or miscalculation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the situation could deteriorate further in the coming months.\u201d",
      "Egypt relies on the Nile for nearly all its drinking water and fiercely opposed the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, asserting that it would threaten the supply. Egypt and Ethiopia have held several rounds of inconclusive talks to regulate the use of the dam, especially in times of drought.",
      "Since the dam's inauguration, Cairo has toughened its rhetoric against Ethiopia. In September, it said it reserved \u201cthe right to take all necessary measures \u2026 to defend the existential interests of its people.\u201d",
      "Ethiopia says the dam is critical for its development as it seeks to lift millions of people out of poverty.",
      "Egypt has also sought to exploit tensions between Ethiopia and its neighbors. It has bolstered security ties with Eritrea and signed a security pact with Somalia, which last year reacted furiously when Ethiopia signed a port deal with the breakaway region of Somaliland, over which Somalia claims sovereignty.",
      "The war in Ethiopia's Tigray region ended with a peace deal in late 2022, but the country's two largest regions \u2014 Amhara and Oromia \u2014 are wracked by ethnic-based insurgencies that threaten internal security.",

      "A decade ago, Brazil passed a law recognizing the crime of femicide defined as the death of a woman in the domestic sphere or as resulting from contempt for women.",
      "Last year, 1,492 women were victims of femicide, the highest number since the law was introduced in 2015, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.",

The previous night, feminist campaigners had disrupted his show with shouts of \u201cAbittan, rapist!\"",

      "Her office said in a statement that she'd been trying to calm his nerves: \u201cAs the video shows, Mrs. Macron\u2019s only intention was to reassure an artist who, in his dressing room before going on stage, had just told her, \u2018I\u2019m scared,\u2019 because his show had been disrupted the previous evening.\"",
      "\"In no way is she attacking a cause. She does, however, disapprove of the radical methods used to prevent an artist from performing on stage, as was the case on Saturday night.\u201d",
      "The feminist campaign group \u201cNous Toutes\u201d (\u201cAll of Us\u201d) said its activists disrupted Abittan\u2019s show to protest what it described as \u201cthe culture of impunity\u201d around sexual violence in France.",

      "\u201cUndoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories. We, clearly, don\u2019t want to give up anything. That\u2019s what we are fighting for,\" Zelenskyy told reporters in a WhatsApp chat late Monday.",

      "In an interview with Politico released Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump again pressed Zelenskyy to accept the U.S. proposal that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, arguing that Moscow retains the \u201cupper hand\u201d in its nearly 4-year-old invasion, and that Zelenskyy\u2019s government must \u201cplay ball.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy met with Pope Leo XIV at Castel Gandolfo, a papal residence outside Rome, and is to have talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni later in the day.

      "The Holy See has tried to stay neutral in the war while offering solidarity and assistance to what it calls the \u201cmartyred\u201d people of Ukraine.

      "A major sticking point in the plan is the suggestion that Kyiv must give up control of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine to Russia, which illegally occupies most but not all of the territory. Ukraine and its European allies have firmly resisted the idea of handing over land.",
      "\u201cYou know, a lot of people are dying,\u201d Trump told Politico on Monday, claiming that other Ukrainian officials that he identified only as Zelenskyy's \u201clieutenants, his top people\u201d agree with the U.S. administration.",
      "Other than Zelenskyy\u2019s comments Monday, Ukrainian negotiators have said very little in public about the content of the U.S. proposal or their attitude toward it.",

      "\u201cI give the people of Ukraine and the military of Ukraine tremendous credit for the, you know, bravery and for the fighting and all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, at some point, size will win, generally.\u201d",
      "Trump also repeated his call for Ukraine to hold a presidential election even though martial law doesn't allow it and Zelenskyy, elected in 2019, had his five-year term extended because of the war.

      "Archaeologists have uncovered the longest remains of an ancient wall that once encircled Jerusalem during the time of Hanukkah",
      "JERUSALEM -- Archaeologists have finished uncovering the longest continuous remains of an ancient wall that encircled Jerusalem, including possible evidence of a 2,100-year-old ceasefire between warring kingdoms.",
      "Last week, archaeologists finished excavating the most complete part ever discovered of the foundations of the walls, which surrounded Jerusalem during the time of the Hasmonean Kingdom, when the story of Hanukkah took place.",
      "In Hebrew, Hanukkah means \u201cdedication,\u201d and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C., after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces, and the Hasmonean Kingdom that followed.",
      "Jews celebrate the eight-day holiday, which this year begins on Dec. 14, with the ritual of lighting a nightly candle, in honor of the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple that lasted for eight nights instead of just one. Many also eat fried foods such as potato pancakes, called latkes, to memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil.",
      "The Hasmonean wall foundation, whose excavation was finished last week in Jerusalem, was likely built a few decades after the story of Hanukkah by the same rulers. It's almost 50 meters (164 feet) long, around half the length of a football field, and around 5 meters (16 feet) wide. It held walls, which according to estimations and some historical writings, were taller than the current walls surrounding Jerusalem\u2019s Old City.",
      "Much of the current walls surrounding Jerusalem\u2019s Old City date back hundreds of years to the Ottoman Era.",
      "The Hasmonean walls encircled an area much larger than the current Old City of Jerusalem, with 60 watchtowers along the wall that were more than 10 meters (33 feet) tall, according to ancient writings. The part recently uncovered is one of the longest sections found intact from the foundation of the Hasmonean walls.",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the foundation was that the wall above it seems to have been purposefully and uniformly dismantled to a uniform height, not chaotically destroyed by the ravages of time or war, said Dr. Amit Re\u2019em, one of the lead archaeologists for the project from the Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "Experts wondered why any leader would take apart a perfectly good security wall in an area that was constantly threatened by invasion.",
      "In 132 or 133 B.C., Hellenistic King Antiochus the Seventh, an heir to the Antiochus the Fourth from the story of Hanukkah, laid siege to Jerusalem and the Judean Kingdom, according to ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.",
      "As the Judean army struggled, Jewish king John Hyrcanus I decided to strike a deal with Antiochus. He raided King David\u2019s tomb for 3,000 talents of silver and offered 500 hostages, including his own brother, according to the writings of Josephus.",

Josephus\u2019 writings state that after Antiochus accepted Hyrcanus\u2019 deal, they \u201cpulled down the walls encircling the city.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just think that we found the archaeological proof for it, so it\u2019s pretty amazing, the archaeology and the ancient stories combining together, this is the magic of Jerusalem,\u201d Re\u2019em said.",
      "Another hypothesis Re\u2019em posits is that King Herod built his palace over the Hasmonean wall foundations, during his reign in the first-century B.C., as a clear message of his sovereignty over Jewish Jerusalem.",
      "Other archaeologists were intrigued by why this section of the Hasmonean wall seems to have been dismantled.",
      "Orit Peleg-Barkat, the head of classical archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, believes it likely had more to do with King Herod\u2019s palace than the ceasefire deal with Antiochus.",
      "Other sections of the Hasmonean wall uncovered in other parts of Jerusalem weren't dismantled, so it could have just been one section that was dismantled, possibly to provide a foundation for Herod's palace, Peleg-Barkat explained. Its unlikely that Jerusalem was left unprotected without any security walls for more than a century, she said.",
      "The current section of the wall was uncovered underneath an abandoned wing of the building known as the Kishleh, which was built in 1830 as a military base. The wing was used as a prison, including by the British up until the 1940s, and the walls were covered with graffiti carved by prisoners in English, Hebrew and Arabic.

      "Most of the building is still used by the Israeli police today, but one wing was abandoned and later transferred to the Tower of David Museum. Archaeologists first began excavating this wing of the Kishleh in 1999, but violence in Jerusalem during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, halted the excavations until two years ago.",
      "Archaeologists removed the equivalent of two Olympic swimming pools worth of dirt and debris by hand over the past two years from the hall. The excavations revealed what they believe are Middle Age-era dye pits, likely for fabric dying, and the long section of the Hasmonean wall foundation.",
      "In the coming years, the Tower of David Museum will install a floating glass floor over the ruins and use the hall as one of its new galleries in the Schulich Wing of Archaeology, Art and Innovation. The renovations of this section are expected to take at least two years, now that the archaeological dig has concluded.",

      "Rain has finally fallen in Iran's capital after months of drought",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Rain fell for the first time in months in Iran's capital Wednesday, providing a brief respite for the parched Islamic Republic as it suffers through the driest autumn in over a half century.",
      "The drought gripping Iran has seen its president warn the country it may need to move its government out of Tehran by the end of December if there's not significant rainfall to recharge dams around the capital. Meteorologists have described this fall as the driest in over 50 years across the country \u2014 from even before its 1979 Islamic Revolution \u2014 further straining a system that expends vast amounts of water inefficiently on agriculture.",
      "The water crisis has even become a political issue in the country, particularly as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly offered his country's help to Iran, a nation he launched a 12-day war against in June. Water shortages also have sparked localized protests in the past, something Iran has been trying to avoid as its economy struggles under the weight of international sanctions over its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe water crisis in Iran has, in recent years, escalated from a recurring drought issue into a profound political and security problem that has the regime leadership concerned,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center said.",
      "The drought has been a long subject of conversation across Tehran and wider Iran, from government officials openly discussing it with visiting journalists to people purchasing water tanks for their homes. In the capital, government-sponsored billboards call on the public not to use garden hoses outside to avoid waste. Water service reportedly goes out for hours in some neighborhoods of Tehran, home to 10 million people.",
      "Snowpack on the surrounding Alborz Mountains remains low as well, particularly after a summer that saw temperatures rise near 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas of the country, forcing government buildings to shut down.",
      "Ahad Vazifeh, an official in the government's Iran Meteorological Organization office, called the drought \u201cunprecedented\u201d in an interview with the Fararu news outlet last week. Precipitation now stands at about 5% of what's considered a normal autumn, he added.",
      "\u201cEven if rain in the winter and spring will be normal, we will have 20% shortage,\u201d Vazifeh warned.",
      "Social media videos show people standing in some reservoirs, the water lines clearly visible. Satellite pictures analyzed by The Associated Press also show reservoirs noticeably depleted. That includes the Latyan Dam \u2014 one of five key reservoirs \u2014 which is now under 10% full as Tehran has entered its sixth consecutive year of drought.",
      "The state-owned Tehran Times newspaper, often following the theocracy's line, was blunt about the scale of the challenge.",
      "\u201cIran is facing an unprecedented water crisis that threatens not only its agricultural sector but also regional stability and global food markets,\" the newspaper said in a story this past weekend. The faithful have also offered prayers for rain at the country's mosques.",

      "Iran, straddling the Mideast and Asia, long has been arid due to its geography. Its Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges cause a so-called \u201crain shadow\u201d across much of the nation, blocking moisture coming from the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf.",
      "But the drain on the country's water supplies has been self-inflicted. Agriculture uses an estimated 90% of the country's water supplies. That hasn't been stopped even through these recent drought years. That's in part due to policies stemming from Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who pledged water would be free for all. The intervening years of the Iran-Iraq war saw the country push for self-sufficiency above all else, irrigating arid lands to grow water-intensive crops like wheat and rice, and overdrilling wells.",
      "Experts have described Iran as facing \u201cwater bankruptcy\u201d over its decisions. In the past, Iranian officials have blamed their neighbors in part for their water shortage, with hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at one point falsely suggesting that \u201cthe enemy destroys the clouds that are headed towards our country and this is a war Iran will win.\u201d",
      "But that's changed with the severity of the crisis leading to current President Masoud Pezeshkian warning the capital may need to be moved. However, such a decision would cost billions of dollars the country likely doesn't have as it struggles through a major economic crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, climate change likely has accelerated the droughts plaguing Iraq, which has seen the driest year on record since 1933, as well as Syria and Iran, said World Weather Attribution, a group of international scientists who study global warming\u2019s role in extreme weather.",
      "With the climate warmed by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) due to fossil fuel burning, the severity of drought seen in Iran over the last year can be expected to return every 10 years, the group said. If the temperature hadn't risen by that much, it could be expected between every 50 to 100 years, it added.",
      "\u201cThe current acute crisis is part of a longer term water crisis in Iran and the wider region that results from a range of issues including, frequent droughts with increasing evaporation rates, water-intensive agriculture and unsustainable groundwater extraction,\u201d World Weather Attribution said in a recent report.",
      "\"These combined pressures contribute to chronic water stress in major urban centers including Tehran, reportedly at risk of severe water shortages and emergency rationing, while also straining agricultural productivity and heightening competition over scarce resources.\"",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other top officials have gathered to discuss preparations for the ruling party's first full congress in five years, state media reported Wednesday. The top-level meeting will set new priorities as the U.S. and South Korea seek a resumption of talks with North Korea.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim presided over a plenary meeting of the Workers Party's Central Committee on Tuesday. It said participants began discussing unspecified key issues related to the party congress and reviewing this year's state policies.",
      "KCNA gave no further details, but observers say the plenary meeting will likely last a few days and set an official agenda for the party congress, which is expected to be held in January or February.",
      "The congress, the top decision-making organ of the Workers\u2019 Party, was revived by Kim in 2016 after a 36-year hiatus. Experts say Kim aimed to increase the party\u2019s authority as part of efforts to solidify his grip on power.",
      "The focus of outside attention on the congress is whether Kim will respond to U.S. and South Korean efforts to improve ties. North Korea has steadfastly rebuffed the U.S. and South Korea's calls to resume talks since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump collapsed in 2019, but some experts say Kim could return to talk with the U.S. next year.",

      "ISTANBUL -- The close relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has brought the countries closer to resolving issues that led to Turkey being kicked off the F-35 fighter jet program, the United States ambassador to Ankara said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe positive relationship between President Trump and President Erdogan has created a new atmosphere of cooperation, which has led to the most fruitful conversations we have had on this topic in nearly a decade,\u201d Ambassador Tom Barrack wrote in a social media post.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the U.S. removed NATO ally Turkey from the next-generation fighter program after Turkey purchased an air defense system from Russia. U.S. officials worried that Turkey\u2019s use of Russia\u2019s S-400 missile system could be used to gather data on the capabilities of the F-35 and that the information could end up in Russian hands.",
      "Ankara has long sought to be readmitted to the project, which was developed by the U.S. and other NATO members. Erdogan has said Turkey invested $1.4 billion before it was suspended from the program in 2019. The U.S. also imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act the following year.",
      "Barrack, who is also Trump\u2019s special envoy for Syria, said there were \u201congoing discussions with T\u00fcrkiye regarding their desire to rejoin the F-35 program and their possession of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system.\u201d",
      "Using the Turkish government\u2019s preferred spelling for Turkey, he said the \u201cpositive relationship\u201d between Trump and Erdogan had \u201ccreated a new atmosphere of cooperation, which has led to the most fruitful conversations we have had on this topic in nearly a decade.",

      "While it has been excluded from receiving F-35s, Turkey has been looking elsewhere to bolster its air force, including Eurofighter Typhoons and U.S.-made F-16s. It is developing its own fifth-generation KAAN fighter jet, which is expected to enter service in 2028.",
      "In a meeting with Erdogan at the White House in September, Trump signaled that the U.S. might soon lift the ban on sales of F-35s to Ankara. The two leaders forged what Trump has described as a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d during his first White House term.",
      "The Obama and Biden administrations kept Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for 22 years, at arm\u2019s length. U.S. officials cited concerns about Turkey\u2019s human rights record and the country\u2019s ties with Russia. Tensions between Turkey and Israel, another important American ally, have made relations difficult with Turkey at times.",

      "A woman from Syria's Alawite minority has spoken about her harrowing experience of being kidnapped and raped by gunmen",
      "LATAKIA, Syria -- The woman, a member of Syria 's Alawite religious minority, was walking home on a sunny July day in her town on the Mediterranean coast when three gunmen stopped her and pulled her into their van. It was the start of a week of torment.",
      "They drove her to a town in northern Syria three hours away, where they locked her in a room in an abandoned building. Over the coming days she was raped twice, she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cYou Alawite women were born to be our sabaya,\u201d she said one of the rapists told her, using an Arabic term common among Sunni Muslim extremists for women taken in war as sex slaves. The woman, in her mid-30s, gave her account on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad a year ago, dozens of women from the Alawite religious sect \u2014 to which Assad belonged \u2014 have been subjected to kidnappings and sexual assault, according to rights groups. In many cases, the attacks appear to be by Sunni extremists and jihadis motivated by sectarian hate.",
      "That has raised suspicions some are allies or former allies of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist insurgent force that overthrew Assad and was led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, now Syria\u2019s interim president. Foreign jihadi fighters and Syrian extremists fought alongside HTS during Syria\u2019s yearslong civil war.",
      "Rights groups say the attacks on Alawite women appear to be the acts of individuals, not systematic. But rights workers and victims say Syria's new authorities are not doing enough to stop the attacks. In response to public outcry, the government set up a committee to look into reported kidnappings but said it largely found the reports false.",
      "Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said the kidnappings \u201ccannot be denied.\u201d",
      "The problem, she said, \u201ccannot be pushed away because it\u2019s disturbing or because it\u2019s undermining the message and the image of authorities.\"",
      "Syria's Interior Ministry spokesman did not respond to repeated questions on the assaults.",
      "The AP interviewed two rape victims and one kidnapping victim, in addition to family members of four others subjected to assaults that in three cases included rape. All spoke on condition they remain anonymous, fearing reprisals. One said she feared authorities would not protect her and later asked the AP not to cite her account.",
      "All women and relatives interviewed by the AP said they informed security forces about what happened to them and authorities took their testimonies. It was not clear if the authorities followed up further or if any arrests were made.",
      "Amnesty International said earlier this year it had received credible reports of at least 36 Alawite women and girls abducted between February and July. The kidnappings took place in the heartland of the Alawite population, in coastal Latakia and Tartous provinces and neighboring Homs and Hama.",
      "Although on a much smaller scale, the attacks recall dark memories of the Islamic State group\u2019s enslavement of thousands of Yazidi women for rape a decade ago in Iraq. Some Sunni extremists consider Alawites heretics and believe it is religiously permitted to take their women as sex slaves. Others have targeted Alawites in revenge for atrocities against Sunnis during the 54-year rule of the Assad family, when there were widespread reports of sexual violence against women in detention centers.",
      "The attacks against women have intensified since March, when clashes between Assad supporters and security forces spiraled into sectarian atrocities in which hundreds of civilians were killed, mostly Alawites at the hands of pro-government fighters.",
      "The Interior Ministry committee investigated 42 cases of alleged kidnappings, but only found one to be a real abduction, ministry spokesman Nour al-Din al-Baba said in mid-November. The committee found that the rest were false claims or instances where a woman ran off with a romantic partner or fled domestic abuse, or cases of blackmail or prostitution, he said, without providing evidence.",
      "The ministry report \"has nothing to do with reality,\u201d says Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.",
      "The woman snatched in the van said her three abductors were Syrians wearing black uniforms, though she couldn\u2019t see distinctive insignia on them. During the drive, they passed several checkpoints but were waved through without being stopped or searched, she said.",

They stopped and he bought her sweets from a store, then dropped her off at a taxi station in Idlib city, she said.",
      "Not long after returning home, a state investigator came to her family home and questioned her about what happened. She identified the Iraqi through security footage from the sweets shop. But it is not known if he was arrested, and officials did not comment when asked.",

      "The United Nations says the world needs a new way of thinking about environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet",
      "The world needs a new approach to environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet by adopting policies to jointly tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.",
      "Those issues are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's quadrennial Global Environment Outlook said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,\u201d said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. \"You can\u2019t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.\"",
      "They\u2019re \u201call undermining our economy,\" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.",
      "Almost 300 scientists from 83 countries contributed to this year's report \u2014 called the most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken \u2014 which was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.",
      "Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.",
      "Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt has to be done rapidly now because we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",
      "The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.",
      "Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases \u2014 primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil \u2014 reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.",
      "Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.",
      "Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.",
      "What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix climate change, we\u2019re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,\u201d Hayhoe said.",
      "Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded; more than 1 million plant and animal species face extinction; and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.",
      "Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.",

It noted a stronger fiscal position, higher foreign exchange reserves \u2014 now at $14.5 billion \u2014 and an uptick in growth.

      "Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at a record 12.1 million in March 2022, when the economy was roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

      "Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are meeting this week to decide whether to cut their benchmark interest rate, and the gathering is expected to be unusually contentious. Inflation remains stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, partly because importers have tried to pass along the cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs by raising prices. Normally, stubborn inflation would discourage Fed policymakers from cutting rates.

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re in the market for a new vehicle, the remaining weeks of December could be a great time to buy",
      "If you\u2019re in the market for a new vehicle, the remaining weeks of December could very well be a great time to buy. Several recurring industry trends converge at year-end, creating favorable conditions that can help you save money. The auto experts at Edmunds have come up with three key reasons why December often delivers the opportunity for better deals \u2014 and what to know to ensure you get the best one.",
      "Manufacturers and dealers operate under annual targets, and December is when they make their most concerted effort to meet them. According to Edmunds transaction data, December has historically delivered the highest average discounts off the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price for both new and used cars. The pandemic somewhat upended that, sending new car prices skyrocketing year-round as demand exceeded supply, but that blip has largely stabilized since 2022.",
      "Typically, as the calendar year draws to a close, automakers and their dealer networks shift into high gear, deploying cash-back incentives, financing specials and price cuts to help them meet sales goals and finish the year strong. As a car shopper, you can take advantage of this year-end push. By choosing to buy a vehicle in December, you are more likely to encounter a dealership willing to make a deal, even if it\u2019s less profitable.",
      "It can get even sweeter for you if you can wait until the final week of the month. Edmunds data shows that the last few days of December \u2014 when dealerships are truly up against the wall of both monthly and annual deadlines \u2014 tend to produce the deepest discounts of the year. Think of it as the auto industry\u2019s version of a clearance countdown when every sale counts a little extra.",
      "As new-model-year vehicles begin to arrive, many dealerships find themselves with previous model-year vehicles still on the lot. These outgoing models become ripe for discounts because they\u2019re taking up space and declining in value. In a handful of states, dealerships are also required to pay a tax on the value of their inventory on the lot as of January 1. This is a massive hidden motivator that drives desperation on December 31, specifically for vehicles that have been on the lot for 90 days or more.",
      "Edmunds highlights that vehicles from the outgoing model year or those undergoing minimal changes often get steeper incentives. While new models are launched year-round these days, December is when current-year models still on the lot are targeted by sales managers as \u201cmust-move\u201d inventory. Currently, that means 2025 vehicles will receive the largest discounts.",
      "Accordingly, you can also maximize your savings if you can be flexible on features, trim or color, so the deals on carry-over models can be substantial. If the vehicle you want hasn\u2019t changed dramatically from year to year, you may be able to purchase a car that\u2019s essentially the same as a new model at a lower price.",
      "Beyond price reductions, December offers an advantageous backdrop for better financing terms on new vehicles. Edmunds\u2019 research shows that automakers and their financing arms often bundle lower interest rates, longer promotional terms or enhanced lease offers at year-end in tandem with their clearance efforts. For example, an automaker might offer special 0% financing on certain vehicles for well-qualified buyers. Getting 0% financing, or even 2%, is a big savings over the standard financing rate of 6%-7% currently.",

      "For shoppers who have done their homework \u2014 secured preapproval, identified the trims they\u2019re willing to consider, and are ready to sign \u2014 this timing can offer both a lower purchase price and a lower cost of borrowing. Buyers can gain even more leverage by being strategic: a dealer may have several examples of the same model, some of which have been in inventory for an extended period. Each day a car sits unsold costs the dealership more. That creates extra motivation to discount older inventory or specific vehicles.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not just about when you buy, but which specific car you target. The right combination of timing, financing and flexibility can make December deals even more rewarding.",
      "December packs together three powerful forces for buyers seeking the best deals: dealer urgency to hit quotas, clearance of outgoing-model stock and enhanced financing leverage. Make sure to get an early start on the shopping so that you have a better selection and don\u2019t feel pressured to make a hasty decision.",

      "Southeast Asia is embracing the embattled offshore wind industry as it reels from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s rejection of renewable energy",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Southeast Asia is a bright spot for the embattled offshore wind industry as it reels from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s push against renewable energy.",
      "The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projectsinto turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, like Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.",
      "Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.",
      "Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world\u2019s most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.",
      "Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.",
      "\u201cAsia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.",
      "He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.",
      "The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects \u2014 a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.",
      "Trump\u2019s anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.",
      "That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.",
      "Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world\u2019s wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region\u2019s offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven\u2019t had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world\u2019s future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific\u2019s electricity, according to the IEA.",

      "President Donald Trump is giving farmers some $12 billion in aid to help as they struggle to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion farm aid package Monday \u2014 a boost to farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war.",
      "He unveiled the plan Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from farm states, and farmers who thanked him for the help.",
      "\u201cWith this bridge payment, we\u2019ll be able to farm another year,\u201d Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Trump during the event.",
      "Rollins put the immediate value of the program at $11 billion \u2014 money that the White House said will offer one-time payments to row-crop farmers. Another $1 billion will be put aside for specialty crops as the administration works to better understand the circumstances for those farmers, Rollins said. The aid will move by the end of February, she said.",
      "\u201cWe looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,\u201d Trump said, explaining how the administration came up with the size of the package. Trump said the money for the program will come from tariff revenue.",
      "Later this month, the USDA will use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or person, and only entities that make less than $900,000 a year will be eligible for aid. That will limit payments to large farms, which was a criticism of farm aid Trump delivered in his first term.",
      "Farmers have backed Trump politically, but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.",
      "The aid is the administration\u2019s latest effort to defend Trump\u2019s economic stewardship and answer voter angst about rising costs. Trump has been dismissive of the affordability issue at times, but on Tuesday, he is set to travel to Pennsylvania to talk about how his administration is trying to address a concern that is important for voters.",
      "Soybeans and sorghum were hit the hardest by Trump's trade dispute with China because more than half those crops are exported each year with most of the harvest going to China.",
      "In October, after Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. China is the world\u2019s largest buyer of soybeans, but in recent years it has increasingly been shifting its purchases over to Brazil and other South American nations.",
      "China has purchased more than 2.8 million metric tons of soybeans since Trump announced the agreement at the end of October. That\u2019s only about one quarter of what administration officials said China had promised, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said China is on track to meet its goal by the end of February, which is two months later than the White House originally promised.",
      "The size of the $12 billion aid package is roughly the value of total U.S. soybean exports to China in 2024 and half the total exports of U.S. farm goods to China in 2024.",
      "Farmers appreciate the aid package, but they say it\u2019s likely only a down payment on what\u2019s needed and government aid doesn\u2019t solve the fundamental problems of soaring costs and uncertain markets. During Trump\u2019s first term, he gave farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 at the start of his trade war with China and nearly $46 billion in 2020, although that year also included aid related to the COVID pandemic.",

      "BENGALURU, India -- Climate change is battering Asia\u2019s water and power systems and putting millions in harm\u2019s way, forcing countries to pour billions into shoring up basic services, according to two recent reports.",
      "Water-related disasters are rising across the region even as spending to protect communities falls short. Asian nations will need $4 trillion for water and sanitation between 2025 and 2040 \u2014 about $250 billion a year, the Asian Development Bank said in a report released Monday.",
      "Governments are under growing pressure to protect power systems people rely on every day. By 2050, extreme weather could leave listed power companies in Asia-Pacific with about $8.4 billion a year in damage and lost revenue, a third higher than now, according to recent research by the Hong Kong-based non-profit Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the New York-based MSCI Institute, a sustainability think tank.",

      "The ADB report says 2.7 billion people, about 60% of the Asia-Pacific population, have access to water for most of their basic needs but more than 4 billion still remain exposed to unsafe water, degraded ecosystems and escalating climate hazards.",
      "Much of the progress since 2013 comes from major gains in rural water access, it says. About 800 million more people in rural areas now have piped water, helping many countries move out of the lowest level of water security. India played a big part in this shift.",
      "But Asia faces a triple threat: environmental pressures, low investment and climate change, said Vivek Raman, principal urban development specialist at the ADB and a lead author of the report.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two realities,\u201d Raman said.",
      "The report says water ecosystems were rapidly deteriorating or stagnating in 30 of the 50 Asian countries that were studied, plagued by unchecked development, pollution and land being converted to other uses. Asia also accounts for 41% of global flooding and its coastal megacities and Pacific islands face mounting threats from storm surges, rising sea levels and salty water pushing inland. From 2013 to 2023, Asia and the Pacific experienced 244 major floods, 104 droughts, and 101 severe storms \u2014 events that undermined development gains and caused widespread damage.",
      "Governments currently meet only 40% of the estimated $4 trillion in investment, or roughly $250 billion annually, in funding needed for water and sanitation from 2025-2040. That leaves an annual shortfall of over $150 billion.",

So, this is an opportunity to rethink and build in a new way,\u201d he said.",

      "Asia accounts for 60% of the world\u2019s power generation capacity and remains deeply reliant on coal. The report warns that climate changes threatens both energy security and economic growth across a region where over 4 billion people need reliable electricity.",

      "Its study of 2,422 power plants across China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea found extreme heat to be the costliest hazard, responsible for over half of all losses by 2050. Heatwaves reduce power plant efficiency and strain transmission networks. India\u2019s main power utility NTPC, Indonesia\u2019s PLN, and Malaysia\u2019s Tenaga Nasional all face a high risk of disruptions caused by rising heat.",

      "At the same time, heavy rainfall and flooding also pose risks, especially in coastal and riverine regions. Malaysia\u2019s Tenaga Nasional faces some of the highest coastal flood exposure due to power plants built in low-lying areas, the report said.",
      "Despite mounting hazards, most utilities lacked detailed, funded plans for adapting to climate impacts. The report found that while nine companies of the 11 studied assessed how climate change impacts them, only seven examined risks at individual plants. Just five calculated and disclosed how future climate impacts could raise costs or hurt their earnings.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Incoming Berkshire Hathaway CEO Greg Abel is assembling his team to help him lead the conglomerate Warren Buffett built starting in January after a couple of key departures.",
      "Berkshire said Monday that one of its two investment managers besides Buffett who has also served as CEO of Geico for several years, Todd Combs, and longtime Chief Financial Officer Mac Hamburg are both departing. Combs is taking a job helping JP Morgan decide how to invest $10 billion while serving as a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon while Hamburg is retiring after 40 years.",
      "Combs' departure is the most significant news in the announcement that also included creating the jobs of general counsel and a new manager of the many retail and consumer businesses Berkshire owns, But now the question is whether insurance Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, investment manager Ted Weschler and all the CEOs of Berkshire's myriad businesses will remain.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still two elephants in the room: what\u2019s Ajit Jain going to do and what is Ted Weschler gonna do?\u201d CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said.",
      "Geico's Chief Operating Officer Nancy Pierce was promoted to CEO, but Berkshire didn't offer any details about how Abel will handle the company's stock portfolio that's worth more than $300 billion. Buffett said last year that Abel will ultimately be responsible for picking stocks as well as trying to find acquisitions and deciding where to reinvest in Berkshire's dozens of businesses while managing all of those companies. But Abel has never been a stock investor, so the plan was for Combs and Weschler to help manage the portfolio.",
      "But Dimon's move to hire Combs away from Berkshire and off of JP Morgan's board where he had served for nine years prevented that from happening. \u201cTodd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett,\u201d Dimon said.",

Buffett will remain chairman, but Shields said \u201cwe expect more turnover in coming months, since the cachet of working for Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor is not (at least yet) the same as working for Mr. Buffett himself.\u201d",
      "Most of those coming departures may not generate headlines, but Shields said he expects a number of the CEOs of Berkshire subsidiaries who have been working long past a typical retirement age will depart now that they are no longer able to work for Buffett.",
      "But CEOs who have been reporting to Abel for several years have said they have been impressed with the business acumen he has demonstrated while overseeing businesses as varied as Dairy Queen, Brooks running shoes, Iscar Metalworking, Marmon Holdings and Helzberg Diamonds. Buffett has said that Abel might be able to get more out of all Berkshire's businesses that he has because Abel is more hands on.",
      "But in an acknowledgment of the fact that he will have less time available when he becomes CEO, Abel promoted NetJets CEO Adam Johnson to a new role overseeing all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. Abel will continue to oversee all the manufacturing, utility and industrial businesses, including BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.",
      "Shields said he doesn't expect a huge change in direction or see Berkshire split up under Abel, but he's impressed that he's willing to depart from the way Buffett has always run things and implement a more typical corporate structure.",

      "Michael Jordan's attorneys are under pressure to wrap up their case in the federal antitrust trial against NASCAR",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Michael Jordan's attorneys were under pressure Tuesday to complete their presentation in the federal antitrust trial against NASCAR that is plodding so slowly the judge has repeatedly admonished both sides.",
      "An economist used almost all of Monday to explain how he landed at a figure of $364.7 million in damages owed by NASCAR to 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports in their revenue-sharing dispute with the top motorsports series in the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge had previously told Jeffrey Kessler, attorney for the two race teams, that he wants Kessler's case completed Tuesday, the seventh day of the trial in the Western District of North Carolina. He also asked the nine-person jury to serve an additional hour for the remainder of the week in an effort to avoid using a full third week to complete the case.",
      "Edward Snyder, a professor of economics who worked in the antitrust division of the Department of Justice and has testified in more than 30 cases, including \u201cDeflategate\u201d involving the NFL\u2019s New England Patriots, will continue testimony Tuesday.",
      "He's so far outlined why he found NASCAR to be in a monopoly using anticompetitive business practices, and explained the complex formula to decide 23XI is owed $215.8 million while Front Row is owed $148.9 million.",
      "Based on his calculations, Snyder determined NASCAR shorted 36 chartered teams $1.06 billion from 2021-24.",
      "NASCAR contends Snyder\u2019s estimations are wrong and its own two experts \u201ctake serious issue\u201d with the findings. Defense attorney Lawrence Buterman asked Snyder his opinion on NASCAR\u2019s upcoming expert witnesses and Snyder said they were two of the best economists in the world.",
      "Bell wants the defense to get to at least its first witness before end of day Tuesday, but Kessler has three remaining on his list once Snyder's testimony concludes. Kessler still plans to call NASCAR chairman Jim France, NASCAR commissioner Steve Phelps and Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress.",
      "The suit is about the 2025 charter agreement, which was presented to teams on a Friday in September 2024 with a same-day deadline to sign the 112-page document. The charter offer came after more than two years of bitter negotiations between NASCAR and its teams, who have called the agreement \u201ca take-it-or-leave-it\u201d ultimatum that they signed with \u201ca gun to their head.\u201d",
      "A charter is similar to the franchise model in other sports, but in NASCAR it guarantees 36 teams spots in the 40-car field, as well as specific revenue.",
      "Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin for 23XI, along with Front Row Motorsports and owner Bob Jenkins, were the only two teams out of 15 to refuse the new charter agreement.",
      "The Florida-based France family founded NASCAR in 1948 and, along with Speedway Motorsports, owns almost all the tracks on the top Cup Series schedule. Snyder noted NASCAR had $2.2 billion in assets, an equity value of $5 billion and an investment-grade credit rating.",
      "Snyder also testified NASCAR had $250 million in annual earnings from 2021-24 and the France family took $400 million in distributions during that period.",

      "Jordan's involvement has put a spotlight on NASCAR that it doesn't want as the global icon tries to prove NASCAR is run by a family of dictators enriching themselves at the expense of the teams and drivers.",
      "NASCAR publicly admitted it wants to settle the case in comments made ahead of the November season finale by Phelps. Jordan has previously said he\u2019s open to a settlement; several mediation sessions failed to find a solution.",
      "Every twist in the yearlong court battle has been a setback for NASCAR, which maintains it did give teams an improved revenue model from the original 2016 charter agreement and everything it has done is for the benefit of growing the sport on the France family dime.",
      "However, Jenkins has claimed he\u2019s never turned a profit in more than two decades of racing and has stated losses between $70 million and $100 million. Jordan and Hamlin have admitted 23XI Racing has been profitable in its five years of existence, but largely based on Jordan\u2019s ability to draw high-dollar sponsors.",
      "NASCAR said Monday it has 16 witnesses on its list, and Hall of Fame team owners Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske, two of the most powerful figures in motorsports, are expected to be called.",
      "Penske, as owner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and IndyCar, which recently adopted its charter system, can testify to race sanctioning agreements, the revenue models and financial health of race teams.",
      "Hendrick, a close friend of the France family for decades, is a car salesman and Charlotte local who can use his communication skills to support the theory everyone in racing understands the financials and willingly enters into NASCAR and the France\u2019s business model.",

      "A private company is offering South Carolina's state-owned utility $2.7 billion to complete two abandoned nuclear plants",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina\u2019s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.",
      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",
      "The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.",
      "Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",
      "If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.",

The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "Also, the type of reactors proposed have seen massive cost overruns even when successfully built. Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building them.",

      "Riley\u2019s family lives 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Wudinna, a community of just over 1,000 in South Australia state. But some of his school friends live as far as 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.",

The platforms face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts.",

      "Riley holds accounts with most of the age-restricted platforms and had been asked by some to verify that he is at least 16. But by Monday, he had not been ousted by any.",
      "Riley\u2019s schoolteacher mother, Sonia Allen, said she wouldn\u2019t help her son get around the ban, but suspects other parents will.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I do know there are other people that would. If the rule is there, the rule is there. But I know what kids are like, and I\u2019ve been a kid before, and they\u2019re going to get around it if they can,\u201d she said.",
      "While the law allows parents no discretion to allow their children to hold social media accounts, Allen said there was a role for parents in regulating their children\u2019s social media use.",
      "A year ago, she banned Riley from social media for several weeks.",
      "\u201cIn the past with Riley, we\u2019ve had to take measures to limit his usage because we found him on social media at midnight and he wasn\u2019t getting his homework done and things like that. We ended up taking it off him for a couple of months,\u201d Allen said. \u201cFrom that, he\u2019s learned to use it a more responsibly.\u201d",
      "Riley, who turns 16 in April, said he understood the ban\u2019s objectives, but there are other ways to achieve them. He suggested a 10 p.m. enforced social media curfew for young children to prevent them losing sleep.",
      "Riley has an ally in Australia\u2019s largest city, Sydney: schoolboy Noah Jones, who turns 16 in August.",
      "Noah is one of two 15-year-old plaintiffs in a constitutional challenge to the law in the High Court. The other in the case brought by the Sydney-based rights group Digital Freedom Project is schoolgirl Macy Neyland.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",
      "The problem is also spreading into areas such as private education, cosmetics and illegal gambling services, leaving the Korea Consumer Agency and other watchdogs struggling to keep pace, the Government Policy Coordination Office said.",
      "Beyond deceptive ads and misinformation, South Korea is also grappling with sexual abuse enabled by AI and other digital technologies. A Seoul court last month sentenced a 33-year-old man to life in prison for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused more than 200 victims, including many minors who were threatened with deepfakes and other manipulated sexual images and videos.",

      "Officials will also strengthen monitoring and faster takedown procedures, including enabling reviews within 24 hours and introducing an emergency process to block harmful ads even before deliberation is complete. They also plan to bolster the monitoring capabilities of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry and the Korea Consumer Agency \u2014 using AI, of course.",
      "Prime Minister Kim, Seoul\u2019s No. 2 official behind President Lee Jae Myung, said during the policy meeting that it\u2019s crucial to \u201cminimize the side effects of new technologies\u201d as the country embraces the \u201cAI era.\u201d",
      "The plans to label AI-generated ads were announced as Lee, in a separate meeting with business leaders, reiterated his government\u2019s ambitions for AI, pledging national efforts to strengthen South Korea\u2019s capabilities in advanced computer chips that power the global AI race.",
      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",
      "The science and telecommunications ministry also said Wednesday it will require the country\u2019s wireless carriers to transition to 5G standalone networks, which are seen as optimal for advanced AI applications because of their higher bandwidth and lower latency, as a condition for renewing their 3G and LTE licenses.",

      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

But also for the global community, who are looking at Australia and saying: well, if Australia can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Albanese later told a gathering of reform supporters at his official Sydney residence, including parents who blame social media for a child\u2019s suicide.",
      "Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) from Wednesday if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "The ban will be enforced by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. She said the platforms already had the technology and personal data about their users to enforce the age restriction with precision.",
      "She would send the 10 targeted platforms on Thursday notices demanding information on how the age restriction was being implemented and how many accounts had been closed.",

She said more than 200,000 TikTok accounts in Australia had already been deactivated by Wednesday.",
      "Wells also warned young children who had so far evaded detection that they would eventually be caught. A child who used a virtual private network to appear to be in Norway would be caught out if they were routinely posting images of Australian beaches, Wells said.",
      "\u201cJust because they might have avoided it (detection) today doesn\u2019t mean they will be able to avoid it in a week\u2019s time or a month\u2019s time because social media platforms have to go back and routinely check under-16 accounts,\u201d Wells said.",
      "\u201cThese social media platforms have so much data on us because we choose to give it to them because we like social media and because you\u2019ve had your older brother scan their face for you today, which has bought you a bit of time, doesn\u2019t mean that these accounts aren\u2019t going to see you talking to other 14-year-olds tonight about the under-16 soccer carnival on weekend, about your upcoming school holidays and what your Year 10 teacher is next year,\u201d she added.",
      "Albanese said the implementation would be difficult and \u201cwon\u2019t be perfect.\u201d",

      "Aaron said the other part of the lawsuit \u201cis to basically have them stop threatening myself and my family.\u201d",

      "TORO TORO, Bolivia -- Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters \u2014 capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California\u2019s Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\u201d said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \u201cWe have all these world records at this particular site.\u201d",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThe preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\u201d said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\u201cThis is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn\u2019t think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia\u2019s Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks \u2014 and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer \u2014 suggest that dinosaurs didn\u2019t settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a \"high risk\" watch list",
      "Police body cameras equipped with artificial intelligence have been trained to detect the faces of about 7,000 people on a \u201chigh risk\u201d watch list in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a live test of whether facial recognition technology shunned as too intrusive could have a place in policing throughout North America.",
      "But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project \u2014 switched on last week\u2014 is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent\u2019s northernmost city of more than 1 million people.",
      "A former chair of Axon\u2019s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he\u2019s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there\u2019s some clear indication of the benefits,\u201d said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University.",
      "Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but \u201cearly-stage field research\u201d that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly.",
      "\u201cBy testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post.",
      "The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a \u201cflag or caution\u201d for categories such as \u201cviolent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,\u201d said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to make sure that it\u2019s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,\" said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon\u2019s director of responsible AI.",
      "If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
      "Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has \u201cintentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.\" It didn't rule out using it in the future.",
      "The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints.",
      "While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police.",
      "Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn't match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots.",
      "Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump's administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI.",
      "The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.",
      "But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country.",
      "Many details about Edmonton's pilot haven't been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn't make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses.",

      "Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won't know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there's a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said.",
      "That's only supposed to happen if officers have started an investigation or are responding to a call, not simply while strolling through a crowd. Martin said officers responding to a call can switch their cameras from a passive to an active recording mode with higher-resolution imaging.",
      "\u201cWe really want to respect individuals\u2019 rights and their privacy interests,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The office of Alberta\u2019s information and privacy commissioner Diane McLeod said she received a privacy impact assessment from Edmonton police on Dec. 2, the same day Axon and police officials announced the program. The office said Friday it\u2019s now working to review the assessment, a requirement for projects that collect \u201chigh sensitivity\u201d personal data.",
      "University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he's not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments.",
      "\u201cEdmonton is a laboratory for this tool,\u201d Oriola said. \u201cIt may well turn out to be an improvement, but we do not know that for sure.\u201d",
      "Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public.",

      "LONDON -- Millions of Ukrainians have been plunged into frequent darkness and cold as Russian drones and missiles wage a systematic long-range campaign against the country's energy grid for the fourth consecutive winter.",
      "Even at the offices of Ukraine's mammoth state-owned Naftogaz oil and gas conglomerate in Kyiv, emergency generators have been keeping the lights on.",
      "\"What I can see from my window -- there is an absolutely dark city with only some lights,\" CEO Sergii Koretskyi told ABC News during a video interview. \"I'm sure people recognize this winter as the most difficult since the full-scale invasion started. We can see power cuts from four up to 10 hours a day.\"",
      "Russia's nightly bombardments have increasingly targeted energy infrastructure in recent months, Ukrainian officials say,\u00a0often involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles.",
      "Ukrainian President Voloydmyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly appealed for more Western military aid to help blunt such strikes. \"The Russians' goal is to hurt millions of Ukrainians,\" the president said in a social media post on Saturday.",
      "Between October and December so far, Naftogaz recorded 11 \"massive attacks on gas infrastructure across Ukraine,\" Koretskyi said. \"Our gas production infrastructure has suffered significant damage and destruction,\" he added.",
      "Naftogaz estimates the combined cost of covering its gas shortfall and repairing its production and storage infrastructure at more than $3 billion, Koretskyi said.",
      "\"We can see that the scale and intensity of strikes have changed dramatically,\" Koretskyi added. This year's bombardments have been even more punishing than those in the back end of last winter, he added, when Ukraine had 42% of its domestic gas production knocked out.",
      "Throughout its full-scale invasion -- which began in February 2022 following eight years of lower-intensity cross-border Russian aggression -- Moscow has denied intentionally targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry says it attacks Ukrainian fuel and energy targets that support the Ukrainian armed forces and Ukraine's military-industrial enterprises.",
      "Ukraine is also waging its own long-range strike campaign against Russian energy targets, particularly oil storage and refining facilities. Kyiv says the lucrative proceeds from Russian oil exports help fund Moscow's ongoing invasion.",
      "Koretskyi declined to say what proportion of the country's gas production and storage capacities had been taken offline during this winter's attacks, citing operational security and Moscow's use of public statements and statistics to guide its strike campaign.",
      "But virtually all of Ukraine's regions now routinely face rolling blackouts, imposed to help protect the country's grid while repairs are carried out, leaving millions with only hours of power.",
      "Naftogaz says it supplies gas to 12.5 million households across Ukraine. Around 80% of the population using gas to heat their homes. Each night of Russian attacks threatens new blackouts for tens of thousands\u00a0and sometimes hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "\"Their goal is clear -- this is pure terrorism,\" he said, \"to put us into the darkness without heat during this winter season.\"",
      "Analysts have suggested that Western support could prove vital in helping Ukraine through this winter.",
      "\"Without substantial Western support -- particularly air defense systems, transformers, and financial assistance for emergency repairs -- blackouts are likely to be more regular, people will suffer in the cold, and economic activity may slow,\" political consultant Kateryna Odarchenk wrote for the Center for European Policy Analysis this month.",

      "Yuriy Boyechko, the CEO of the Hope For Ukraine charity, told ABC News that the current energy crisis is a result of inadequate air defenses in the face of \"the relentless deluge of Russian missiles and drones.\" He added, \"The only viable solution is immediate, comprehensive air defense support from Western allies.\"",
      "The bombing has wrought holes in Ukraine's energy network. As of December, Naftogaz estimated that Ukraine needed to import 4.4 billion cubic meters of gas through to the end of this heating season -- which Ukraine's government estimates will end by around March 31.",
      "This is expected to cost some \u20ac1.9 billion -- around $2.2 billion -- Koretskyi said. Zelenskyy and his government have mobilized to secure the funding from foreign partners and financial institutions, but Naftogaz's chief said a hole of around \u20ac600 million remains.",
      "Kyiv is turning to private companies in gas-rich nations like the U.S. to help fill the gap. Companies require two permits to export natural gas -- one from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and one from the Department of Energy.",
      "This year already, more than 500 million cubic meters of American liquid natural gas (LNG) have been imported, with another 300 million cubic meters agreed for import earlier next year.",
      "Through 2026, Koretskyi said, Ukraine would like to bring in another 1 billion cubic meters of American LNG. \"We would like to build long-term relationships with U.S. LNG suppliers,\" he said.",
      "A recent agreement to import U.S. LNG through the Soviet-era Trans-Balkan pipeline running from Greece is also part of this drive, Ukrainian officials have said.",
      "But as Russia's attacks grow larger and more sophisticated, the cost and complexity of recovery grows. Naftogaz's list of equipment needed for repairs is now 190 items strong, Koretskyi said. The estimated cost of this badly needed equipment is more than $900 million, he added.",
      "\"There are two lists of equipment -- the first one for repairing or replacing those damaged or even destroyed, and the second is for a strategic reserve for upcoming potential attacks,\" he explained. U.S. and European suppliers, Koretskyi said, could prove pivotal in filling the gaps.",
      "\"The lead time -- of production time, delivery and installation -- will take between eight and 18 months,\" Koretskyi said. \"So, we should be ready not just for this winter season, but for the next heating season.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the strikes and blackouts continue.",
      "On Dec. 4, for example, the Kherson central heating plant in the southern frontline city was knocked offline after days of attacks by various Russian weapons systems. Kherson military administration head Oleksandr Prokudin said that disruption left more than 40,000 without heat.",
      "\"It's like a nightmare,\" Koretskyi said of life under rolling blackouts for many Ukrainians. \"I do believe Ukrainians recognize the risk, the challenge, that Russia will continue bombing us.\"",
      "\"Nobody can imagine what will happen in the coming months or weeks,\" he added, suggesting that Ukrainians may have to summon reserves of resilience already tapped by almost four years of full-scale war.",
      "\"This is not a sprint, it's a marathon,\" Koretskyi said. \"The war changes, upgrades and becomes different every day. The measures for survival, for protection, should be changed as well ... That's how we live.\"",

      "Top officials at the Federal Reserve have displayed a rare degree of public disagreement over a possible interest rate cut. Inflation has picked up in recent months alongside the hiring slowdown, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "The Fed is stuck in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. To address pressure on both of its goals, the Fed primarily holds a single tool: interest rates.",
      "If the Fed holds interest rates steady as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks a deeper slowdown of the labor market. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.",

      "A quarter-point interest rate cut would reduce the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a level between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "That figure would mark a significant pullback from a peak in 2023. At the outset of the pandemic, interest rates stood at 0%.",

      "A federal judge is set to hear arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by lawyers for Stacey Humphreys, who is scheduled to die on Dec. 17. Humphreys, 52, was convicted of malice murder in the 2003 killings of 33-year-old Cyndi Williams and 21-year-old Lori Brown at the real estate office where they worked in a suburb of Atlanta.",
      "After Georgia put executions on hold during the pandemic, the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume. The state Supreme Court has affirmed that the agreement is a binding contract.",
      "The text of the agreement says it applies only to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while a pandemic-related judicial emergency was in place. The judicial emergency was lifted in June 2021 and the appeals court rejected Humphreys' request in October 2024. Lawyers for the state argue that Humphreys is, therefore, not covered by the agreement and his execution should be allowed to proceed.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that must be met before executions could be scheduled for the covered prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d",
      "Additionally, state lawyers agreed that once those conditions were met, they would provide three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months\u2019 notice for the rest.",
      "Although the judicial emergency was lifted more than four years ago, defense attorneys say the other two conditions have not been met because visitation is \u201cseverely restricted\u201d compared with its pre-pandemic levels and infants under 6 months old are not eligible for the vaccine.",

      "MIAMI -- Hundreds of Nicaraguans sang in praise of the Virgin Mary at flower-and-light-filled altars set up in church parking lots as well as in the back of vehicles on the streets of Miami to mark the Dec. 8 feast of the Immaculate Conception.",
      "The exuberant celebration called \u201cgriter\u00eda\u201d is especially poignant this year during the ongoing crackdowns on religion in Nicaragua as well as on immigrant communities in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it no matter what,\u201d said Neri Flores, who traveled from Chicago to set up an altar with his parents for the vigil Sunday night. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition, family, giving back to the community, keeping up the faith and positive vibes.\u201d",
      "In the back of a large rental SUV parked near a Catholic church, the family put a painting of the Immaculate Conception at the center of their altar. Flores\u2019 mother carried the painting across the U.S.-Mexican border when she was pregnant with him in the early 1980s.",
      "Next to them, another family set up a larger altar with half a dozen statues of the Virgin Mary \u2014 and had four generations helping out.",

      "A mid-19th century Vatican proclamation of the dogma that Mary was conceived free from original sin, which the Catholic faith teaches all humans carry, gave new popularity to the feast day worldwide. In Nicaragua, there's a special tradition for families to create home altars and then go visit others, singing, from house to house.",
      "But those celebrations have been either stifled or co-opted by the Nicaraguan government in an intensifying persecution of religion that human rights advocates, exiled priests and the U.S. government say is one of the most severe in the world.",
      "Like several Latin American governments tracing their roots back to socialist revolutions, Nicaragua\u2019s copresidents Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, have had an uneven relationship with faith leaders for decades.",
      "But since violently repressing civic protests in 2018 and the unfolding human rights crisis, the government has gone after Catholic priests and nuns, whom they accuse of supporting unrest. Clergy and lay observers say the church has become the only voice resisting state violence and aiding its victims.",
      "Hundreds of Christian clergy and lay people have been imprisoned and exiled, many religious festivities have been barred, and many of the remaining faithful say they\u2019re under strict surveillance.",
      "In the United States, the Trump administration has sought to end expanded and temporary legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Nicaragua, as well as from Venezuela, Cuba and Haiti. It\u2019s part of an ongoing crackdown on migrants across the country that has spread fear in many communities.",
      "But at Miami\u2019s St. John Bosco Catholic Parish \u2014 where most of the 3,000 member families are from Nicaragua and Honduras, and many are undocumented \u2014 more than a thousand people lined up Sunday evening to sing and pray by altars set up in the parking lot and the major thoroughfare in front of the church.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s event is all about a gesture of trust,\u201d said the Rev. Yader Centeno, the pastor, who\u2019s also from Nicaragua. \u201cFor the people who are here, it\u2019s a moment to strengthen their faith. And to share a message with those back in Nicaragua that here, we are free.\u201d",
      "Some altars had elaborate balloon arches, twinkling strings of lights and massive sound systems, while others had just a small statue of the Virgin framed by fresh palm fronds in the cars\u2019 hatchbacks.",
      "As visitors reached each altar, they erupted in the traditional \u201cgrito\u201d or cry that many also had emblazoned on T-shirts \u2014 with Spanish for \u201cWho causes so much joy? Mary\u2019s conception!\u201d",

      "Influenced by social media videos of skiers chasing fresh powder tracks in the backcountry, people are increasingly skiing out of bounds, finding themselves lost in the woods and in need of rescue.",
      "On Nov. 29, Stowe Mountain Rescue responded to a 911 call from a skier and snowboarder lost in the woods on Mount Mansfield. The two 19-year-olds had decided to drive up from New York to ski in the backcountry outside Stowe Mountain Resort after seeing videos of others doing so on social media, according to the rescue team.",

      "Stowe Mountain Rescue now sees around eight missions to help groups of lost skiers per season, up from around three such calls only five years ago, and that doesn\u2019t include rescues by Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol in bounds at the resort.",

      "Many of those detained had requested asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in the last two years.

      "The AP couldn\u2019t independently determine each of the Afghans' immigration statuses or the reasons put forward by authorities for their arrests. In one case, the man had been arrested twice on suspicion of domestic violence, according to the government.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland, said in an email that the agency \"has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden\u2019s fraudulent parole programs and working to get the criminals and public safety threats OUT of our country.\u201d",
      "Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the 29-year-old Afghan suspect in the shooting, was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.",
      "Since the shooting, the U.S. government introduced sweeping immigration changes, including pausing asylum applications and requiring increased vetting for immigrants from certain countries. The administration also took steps specifically targeted at Afghans, including pausing all their immigration-related applications and visas for Afghans who closely helped the war effort.",
      "Those who work with Afghans say the stepped-up enforcement amounts to the collective punishment of a population, many of whom risked their lives to protect U.S. troops.",
      "\u201cNot to discount the horrific killing that happened, but that was one bad actor who should be prosecuted by the full extent of the law,\u201d Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, whose California district includes Sacramento, said of Lakanwal. \u201cA lot of these people kept our troops safe and served side by side with our soldiers for two decades in Afghanistan.\"",
      "In Sacramento, Afghan men arrived one by one to the ICE office Dec. 1 after being asked to immediately report there, drawing the attention of volunteers who have been at the federal building for more than six months to monitor ICE activities and alert immigrants.",

      "HOUSTON -- The U.S. Justice Department has withdrawn from an agreement with the city of Houston to curb illegal dumping in Black and Latino neighborhoods, part of the Trump administration\u2019s broad dismantling of environmental justice initiatives.",
      "Federal authorities quietly ended the monitoring this year as they pulled the plug on a similar settlement over wastewater problems in rural Alabama, according to three former law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the move wasn't made public.",
      "Without federal monitoring, advocates in Houston said city officials have become less responsive to residents afflicted by persistent dumping in the historically Black neighborhood of Trinity/Houston Gardens.",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to fight with anymore,\" resident Huey German-Wilson, who has spent years drawing attention to the problem, told The Associated Press during a tour of illegal dumping hotspots. \"We\u2019ve got a watered-down EPA. We\u2019ve got no assistance from the DOJ. The city has no reason to respond to us, and we\u2019re finding that they are truly ignoring us.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department and Houston officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "A DOJ investigation found in 2023 that the Houston neighborhood in question had been inundated by illegal dumping of trash, medical waste, mattresses and even dead bodies and \u201crotting carcasses\u201d \u2014 a description local officials insisted was exaggerated.",
      "Its settlement with the city called for three years of federal monitoring, public data reporting requirements and community outreach to impacted neighborhoods.",
      "Former Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat who died this year after winning a U.S. House seat, had called the DOJ investigation \u201cabsurd, baseless and without merit,\u201d though his administration later agreed to the federal monitoring. The city previously has pointed to its efforts to combat illegal dumping through One Clean Houston, a multimillion-dollar cleanup and enforcement initiative.",
      "The nixing of the settlement, which was set to expire in June 2026, came as the Trump administration directed federal agencies to eliminate jobs and programs dedicated to environmental justice. It followed President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government.",

      "Lowndes County is a high-poverty area between Selma and Montgomery where a type of soil makes it difficult for traditional septic tanks to work.

      "In Houston, illegal dumping has been a hot-button issue for years. It drew the DOJ's attention after Lone Star Legal Aid, a nonprofit law firm that advocates for low-income populations, filed a complaint about city response times lagging considerably for pickups in Black and Latino neighborhoods compared with white communities.",
      "During the first year of federal monitoring, the city picked up illegal dumping much faster, rolled out new vehicles and added workers, said German-Wilson, president of the Trinity/Houston Gardens Super Neighborhood, a community group.",

      "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years",
      "NEW YORK -- The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \u201cThis dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\u201d",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos..",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\u201d Gasman said, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in 2023 looked at the impact of Scott's giving and found few of the recipients have struggled to manage the funds or have seen other funders pullback.",
      "Kim Mazzuca, the CEO of the California-based nonprofit, 10,000 Degrees, said her organization was notified of its first gift from Scott of $42 million earlier this year.",

      "10,000 Degrees provides scholarships, mentoring and other support to low-income students and aims to help them graduate college without taking on loans. Mazzuca said that usually nonprofits grow only gradually, but that this gift will allow them to reach more students, to test some technology tools and to start an endowment.",
      "Mazzuca credited Scott for investing in proven solutions that already exist.",
      "\u201cShe comes from a very deep, reflective space, very heartfelt,\u201d Mazzuca said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s only providing these financial means as a tool for people to recognize they are who they\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d",
      "That idea references a prophecy from the Hopi Tribe that ends with the line, \u201cWe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d Mazzuca said she's drawn on the prophecy for years to empower both her organization and the students it supports to recognize their own power to shape our world.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website under that title and sharing the prophecy. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \u201cmission aligned\u201d investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday in what appears to be the closest American warplanes have come to the South American country's airspace since the start of the Trump administration's pressure campaign.",
      "Public flight tracking websites showed a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets fly over the Gulf \u2014 a body of water bounded by Venezuela and only about 150 miles at its widest point \u2014 and spend more than 30 minutes flying over water. A U.S. defense official confirmed that a pair of jets conducted a \u201croutine training flight\u201d in the area.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, could not say if the jets were armed but noted that they stayed in international airspace during their flight.",
      "The official likened the training flight to previous exercises that were aimed at showing the reach of U.S. planes and said the move was not meant to be provocative.",
      "The military has previously sent B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers to the region, but those planes flew up to and along the coast of Venezuela. There was no indication that those aircraft ever flew as close to the country\u2019s territory as the F/A-18 fighter jets on Tuesday.",
      "The flights are the latest action the U.S. military has taken as it has built up its largest presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. President Donald Trump says land attacks are coming soon but has not offered any details on location.",

      "Democrat Eileen Higgins has won the Miami mayor\u2019s race over a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump",
      "MIAMI -- Democrat Eileen Higgins won the Miami mayor\u2019s race on Tuesday, defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump to end her party\u2019s nearly three-decade losing streak and give Democrats a boost in one of the last electoral battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Higgins, 61, will be the first woman to lead the city of Miami. She spoke frequently in the Hispanic-majority city about Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, saying she has heard of many people in Miami who were worried about family members being detained. She campaigned as a proud Democrat despite the race being officially nonpartisan and beat Trump-backed candidate Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, who said he called Higgins to congratulate her.",
      "\u201cWe are facing rhetoric from elected officials that is so dehumanizing and cruel, especially against immigrant populations,\u201d Higgins told The Associated Press after her victory speech. \u201cThe residents of Miami were ready to be done with that.\u201d",
      "With nearly all votes counted Tuesday, Higgins led the Republican by about 19 percentage points.",
      "The local race is not predictive of what may happen at the polls next year. But it drew attention from the two major national political parties and their leaders. The victory provides Democrats with some momentum heading into a high-stakes midterm election when the GOP is looking to keep its grip in Florida, including in a Hispanic-majority district in Miami-Dade County. The area has shifted increasingly rightward politically in recent years, and the city may become the home of Trump\u2019s presidential library.",
      "\u201cTonight\u2019s result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs,\u201d said Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement.",
      "Some nationally recognized Democrats supported Higgins, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel traveled to Miami on Sunday and Monday to rally voters for the Democrat who served as a Miami-Dade county commissioner for seven years.",
      "Higgins, who speaks Spanish, represented a district that leans conservative and includes the Cuban neighborhood of Little Havana. When she first entered politics in 2018, she chose to present herself to voters as \u201cLa Gringa,\u201d a term Spanish speakers use for white Americans, because many people did not known how to pronounce her name.",
      "\u201cIt just helps people understand who I am, and you know what? I am a \u2018gringa,\u2019 so, what am I going to do, deny it?\u201d she told the AP.",
      "Republicans in Florida have found strong support from voters with heritage from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, because they likened some members of the Democratic party\u2019s progressive wing with politicians from the governments they fled. Trump and other GOP members have tapped into those sentiments over the past eight years.",
      "However, some local Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated since November\u2019s elections when Democrats scored wins in New Jersey and Virginia, where both winning gubernatorial candidates performed strongly with nonwhite voters.",

      "McALLEN, Texas -- Hundreds of immigrant children across the nation were detained for longer than the legal limit this summer, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has admitted in a court filing, alarming legal advocates who say the government is failing to safeguard children.",
      "In a court filing Monday evening, attorneys for detainees highlighted the government's own admissions to longer custody times for immigrant children, unsanitary conditions reported by families and monitors at federal facilities, and a renewed reliance on hotels for detention.",
      "The reports were filed as part of an ongoing civil lawsuit launched in 1985 that led to the creation of the 1990s cornerstone policy known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, which limits the time children can spend in federal custody and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The Trump administration is attempting to end the agreement.",
      "A Dec. 1 report from ICE indicated that about 400 immigrant children were held in custody for more than the 20-day limit during the reporting period from August to September. They also told the court the problem was widespread and not specific to a region or facility. The primary factors that prolonged their release were categorized into three groups: transportation delays, medical needs, and legal processing.",
      "Legal advocates for the children contended those reasons do not prove lawful justifications for the delays in their release. They also cited examples that far exceeded the 20-day limit, including five children who were held for 168 days earlier this year.",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Hotel use for temporary detention is allowed by the federal court for up to 72 hours, but attorneys questioned the government's data, which they believe did not fully explain why children were held longer than three days in hotel rooms.",

      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt has to be done rapidly now because we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",

But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",

      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",

      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",

      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal.

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The playful, graceful and surprising designs of architect Frank Gehry (Feb. 28, 1929-Dec. 5, 2025) changed the skylines of cities around the world, from Los Angeles, New York and Seattle to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Panama City. But he was never completely happy with his work. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022 what he saw when he looked at his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 a Los Angeles landmark whose massive curves fit together like puzzle pieces \u2014 Gehry replied, \"Well, I see what I would do different!\" What sounded like second guessing, Gehry called \"creative insecurity.\"",
      "Born Frank Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, he worked at his grandfather's hardware store, \"playing with the nails and the screws,\" he said. His father brought the family to Los Angeles in 1947, when Frank was 17. \"It just looked like a new world somehow; I was quite moved by it,\" he said.",
      "He fell in love with architecture, and, at the behest of his first wife, who was fearful of antisemitism, changed his last name to Gehry. He began incorporating industrial materials into his designs, but his ideas really took flight once he adapted software created for the aerospace industry. His buildings' flowing curves could now mimic movement.",
      "\"The movement is feeling,\" he said. \"And how do you get a big monster building to have any feeling? And the movement makes that happen. And I think that finding a way to build it was the issue.\" One humorous example: a tower in Prague, inspired by human forms gracefully entangled. The building was nicknamed \"Fred and Ginger.\"",
      "His Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, opened in 1997, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Gehry's aerospace software allowed for the precise calculations necessary to shape titanium into a curving exterior. \"When you go there, you see the light play with the building, especially on gray days when you really want some light, you want a feeling of warmth,\" Gehry said. \"All of a sudden, this metal glows beautifully.\"",
      "Among his other recognizable projects: The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany; the Peter B. Lewis Building in Cleveland; the Lou Ruvo Center in Las Vegas; the Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany; the LUMA Arles Tower in Arles, France; the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis; and the Stata Center in Cambridge, Mass.",
      "Gehry's challenge to architects: \"Think of people and how they're going be inspired by your work, and give them something to think about. That's what a painting does. That's what a sculpture does. And architecture is an art. So, why not?\""

      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ethan-hawke-on-blue-moon-and-taking-nothing-for-granted/",
    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:06:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"Blue Moon\" talks about playing famed songwriter Lorenz Hart, whose successful collaboration with Richard Rodgers ended owing to Hart's heavy drinking; and about his own youthful ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a hundred years ago, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart helped put the \"great\" in the Great American Songbook, with songs like \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" and \"Blue Moon.\"",
      "But by the early 1940s, Hart's heavy drinking made him an unreliable partner. So, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II, and their first production, the landmark musical \"Oklahoma!\" opened at the St. James Theatre on March 31, 1943.",
      "It was an immediate hit, and that night there was a big party a few doors down at Sardi's, that legendary Broadway watering hole, with its walls hung with the caricatures of famous faces. Lorenz Hart showed up at Sardi's that night, and what happened next is now a movie.",
      "In \"Blue Moon,\" Ethan Hawke is Hart, drowning his sorrows at the bar.",
      "For the film, they re-created Sardi's on a soundstage, but \"Sunday Morning\" met Hawke at the real thing.",
      "\"I was definitely the type of young person that would walk in and think, 'When am I gonna get my painting up there?'\" he said. \"I'm not above that. I'm a little heartbroken that I don't have one up yet!\"",
      "Perhaps his time will come. \"My time's coming,\" he said. \"I have hope. I'm not done yet!\"",
      "And this performance is proof: the real Lorenz Hart was less than five feet tall, so director and frequent Hawke collaborator Richard Linklater used camera tricks to make the nearly six-foot actor look short. Hawke also shaved the top of his head to make a real combover, and he learned a mountain of dialogue.",
      "\"It's definitely the most text I've ever had in a movie,\" Hawke said. \"I remember calling my wife after the first day \u2013 I think I had more lines than I had in the previous five films.\"",
      "It was a challenge for an actor whose face usually says it all. In the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society,\" Hawke played a student, and he says he learned a lot from co-star Robin Williams. \"There's a scene where he's talking about how to grade poetry, and he has all the kids rip it out \u2013 I didn't realize how much I was being taught, and how that sustained me through negative criticism. It's like, there's not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead. So you don't like it? Suck an egg. You don't know what great acting is any more than I do.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you're in a movie like that so young, does it set you up? Or does it set you up?\"",
      "\"It's a great question, 'cause it's possibly both,\" he replied. \"If you let it be the high-water mark of your life, it will be, you know, if you put too much on that. You don't want anything at 18 to be the high-water mark of your life.\"",
      "Between movies, Hawke made his Broadway debut with, he says, a lot more confidence than skill. \"That's the weird thing about being young. I had no business being confident at anything. I was a total moron. And I walked in here like I was, you know, John Barrymore.\"",
      "His performance in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" (1992) was described as \"promising.\" But it was clear that his best work was ahead of him.",
      "Hawke got the first of four Oscar nominations for his role in the 2001 film \"Training Day\" opposite Denzel Washington. His performance still resonates. Hawke said, \"When my son was about six, Levon, he said to me, 'Dad, what's \"Training Day?\"' I said, 'Oh, it's the movie I did a few years ago. Why?' He said, \"'cause every time we walk down the street, when people pass you, they say, \"Training Day\"!'\"",
      "But after \"Training Day,\" there was a time when Hawke says he passed on more parts than he took \u2013 and the offers started drying up. \"When you're young, you think it's everybody. You don't realize that This is a young person's game, and those kinds of job offers, there's a shelf life on that.\"",
      "\"When did your shelf life, when did that hit?\" I asked.",
      "\"Around the same time gray starts appearing in your beard,\" he replied.",
      "The gray in the beard works for him now, as a hard-nosed investigative reporter in the critically-acclaimed FX series \"The Lowdown.\" In the series, you never know what's around the next corner \u2013 just as in real life. As we were wrapping up at Sardi's, owner Max Klimavicius suddenly showed up with a surprise for Hawke: \"Ethan, I would like your permission to make you part of our collection,\" he said.",
      "He was a bit stunned, and to be honest, so were we. But after Ethan Hawke's career on screen and stage, it wasn't all that surprising.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said. \"It finally happened. I've got my portrait at Sardi's. I've arrived! Things are looking up in this life!\"",
      "And now, with his latest film in mind, there's talk of more accolades to come.",
      "How does he handle the Oscar buzz surrounding \"Blue Moon\"? Does he tune it out? He said, \"There's the obvious other part of you that goes, like, 'Hey, I dedicated my life to this job, and this is seen as a barometer.' And I would be dishonest if I didn't say that, like, that would be amazing.",
      "\"This is so corny, but it just flashed through my head: I was like 11 or something, I said to my mother, 'What's gonna happen with my life? What's gonna happen?' And she \u2013 and I remember it so vividly \u2013 in the kitchen, like Doris Day [sings] 'When I was just a little girl\u2026' you know, it goes into 'Que Sera, Sera.'",
      "\"You have to have a little 'Que Sera, Sera.' I don't take any of it for granted. That's, I guess, the right answer. Any little bit of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Author Peter Guralnick wrote the definitive two-volume biography of the King: \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley\" (1994), and \"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\" (2000). And now, his latest is about Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager. Asked if he found anything surprising, Guralnick replied, \"It totally surprised me.\"",
      "\"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.) is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
      "Guralnick says Parker did not create the template for being the manager of a musician: \"It wasn't original to him, it wasn't brand new. But he carried it, I think, to a far greater extent than anyone had before.\"",
      "In 1955, the 20-year-old Presley was playing the Louisiana Hayride when Parker first caught his act. \"It took no more than a few days after seeing him for the first time that he booked Elvis when nobody else was willing to book him,\" Guralnick said.",
      "Parker, who was then handling Hank Snow, quickly put Elvis in the show.",
      "Elvis would sell more than 12 million records in 1956. The Colonel negotiated his recording contract, his movie deal, and oversaw all his marketing.\u00a0 As he would write, \"I don't [just] sit here and smoke cigars hoping for something to happen.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"There is so much love in some of his early letters to Elvis. And in one he says, you know, 'You are just like me. You are sensitive, you're easily hurt. But only those we love can hurt us.'\"",
      "Presley would write back, \"I love you like a father.\"",
      "Colonel Tom Parker wasn't actually a colonel; he also wasn't American. In fact, Andreas van Kuijk was a stowaway from Holland, who arrived in the U.S. in 1926, barely speaking English. The 16-year-old soon invented an origin story. \"Once he declared himself to be Tom Parker, born in West Virginia, his identity was never questioned for over 50 years,\" said Guralnick. \"The only person who may have known it was Elvis Presley.\"",
      "The honorary title \"Colonel\" would be bestowed on him by Louisiana's Governor. It became his first name. \"That was how he signed all of his letters,\" said Guralnick.",
      "Before Presley, Parker made a star out of Eddy Arnold, booking him as the first \"hillbilly act\" in Vegas.",
      "Actor George Hamilton, who befriended the Colonel in his early days in Hollywood, said, \"He had all the smarts of a con man, but he wasn't. He knew how to make the other person want whatever he was selling.\"",
      "Asked why Parker was so driven, Hamilton replied, \"Emotional stuff from his childhood. I feel like he had some horrible damage done. He didn't like his father.\"",
      "Parker would become notorious for taking a 50% cut of some of Presley's later deals. \"Now, I sat with him one day and I said, 'Is it right to get half of everything?'\" Hamilton recalled. \"And he said, 'Well, you know, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.' And I said, 'Well, you mean your half, or his?' He said, 'Well, if I didn't have my half, he wouldn't have his!' And I got it. I got it.\"",
      "The Colonel offered Hamilton an opportunity in Vegas: \"He said, 'And by the way, Elvis has gotta take two weeks off at the Hilton. And I booked you in.' I said, 'I can't do that show. That doesn't make any sense, Colonel.' He said, 'George, you want $50,000 a week?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'It's two weeks. For that, you can do anything, can't you?' I said, 'Yes, sir!'\"",
      "In 1973, after Presley bad-mouthed hotel owner Conrad Hilton on stage in Vegas, Parker confronted him backstage. \"Essentially, Elvis and Colonel fired each other,\" said Guralnick.",
      "The split didn't last long. \"Neither Colonel nor Elvis could imagine a world without the other,\" said Guralnick. \"They simply didn't have the ability to walk away.\"",
      "But Parker began to worry about the \"instability of [his] artist.\"",
      "Asked how he reacted to Presley's increasing drug use, Guralnick replied, \"I think he was at a loss. I think there was an element of denial. But he was well aware of what was going on. Nobody could miss what was going on.\"",
      "In Vegas, Colonel developed his own addiction. George Hamilton saw it firsthand: \"He used to get me to go gambling with him. God! He would go all-in on, like, I mean, big money. I saw close to a million dollars lost at a table.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"They were caught in a trap \u2013 as Elvis sang! I mean, neither one of them could confront the other one with his problem.\"",
      "According to the author, the two were locked in a relationship of mutual denial \u2013 the twin tragedies of their story. And when Elvis died in 1977, the Colonel, according to Guralnick, \"went into shock.\"",
      "\"I'll never stop trying to keep nis name alive,\" Parker said. He would die in 1997.",
      "While Guralnick was doing research at Elvis' Memphis mansion Graceland, in what was once the office of Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, he was told the office telephone was disconnected: \"So, one night we were working quite late, and it was 10 o'clock at night. And all of a sudden, the phone rang. And so you know, you'll have to tell me: Was this Elvis? Was this Vernon? Maybe it was Colonel.",
      "\"We stared at it. Should we answer? Should we not answer? Who knows what would happen if we answered? But we did not answer. We just listened to it ring, until it finally stopped ringing!\"",
      "\"You wanted the idea that there was one of those three on the other end of the line?\" I asked.",

      "He first became aware of the boy in early 1955 through an old pal in Texarkana, Arkansas, a DJ, radio personality, and promoter named Ernest Hackworth who went by the name of Uncle Dudley. Hackworth, who, like so many other promoters, worked on his own shows as a country comedian, reported that this kid from Memphis had drawn more than eight hundred people to a little schoolhouse in New Boston, Texas, on January 11, which was a heckuva draw for an unknown artist whose name he usually got all jumbled up.",
      "Oddly enough, Colonel was later reminded, he had actually been told about the boy two months earlier by another old colleague, Oscar Davis, who was wont to say he had made several fortunes (true\u2014he had managed Hank Williams at the height of his career) and lost even more (equally true). Davis, a smooth-tongued, silver-haired operator who went back even further than Colonel in the world of carnivals and show business, was a peer- less pitchman, always immaculately dressed, always sharp as a tack\u2014in the view of a mutual acquaintance who did business with them both, he differed from Colonel in only two ways. Unlike Colonel, Oscar Davis looked the part, \"he looked like the man with the money\"\u2014 but also unlike Colonel (with whom you could operate with complete confidence on a handshake basis) you couldn't trust a word that he said.",
      "Oscar had hit a rough patch lately and was advancing an Eddy Arnold tour for Colonel when he met this Presley boy in Memphis and had even gone to see him perform at some little club where the kid had really gotten the audience worked up. But for one reason or another, it seemed like Oscar wasn't emphasizing the point too strongly, or maybe Colonel just wasn't listening that closely (with Oscar Davis, you didn't want to over-listen), so it wasn't until Uncle Dudley spoke to him the day after the New Boston show that he paid attention.",
      "This time there was no hesitation.",
      "He and Tom Diskin went to see Presley perform at the Louisiana Hayride three days later, and he was so knocked out, not so much by the music\u2014he really wasn't sure at first what to make of the music\u2014as by the reaction of the crowd, that he got in touch with Presley's manager, a Memphis DJ named Bob Neal, right away. Within a week he had him booked on the Hank Snow tour that was about to begin in New Mexico on February 14. Even before the start of the tour, apparently on the strength of the Hayride performance alone, Colonel approached Steve Sholes about signing him to RCA, but as it turned out, the head of Presley's little record label in Memphis, Sam Phillips, wouldn't hear of it, in fact he seemed almost insulted by the idea, so Colonel was forced to let Steve know that it looked like Presley was \"pretty securely tied up\" for the time being.",
      "From the very first dates on the New Mexico tour, the boy's talent\u2014not just his talent but his drive, and especially his capacity for growth\u2014were unmistakable. When asked some eighteen months later if he took credit for Elvis Presley's unparalleled success, the Colonel uncharacteristically demurred. \"I think Presley was a star from the first day he ever started going into show business,\" he said. \"I knew I could help him, [but] I think anyone could have helped him that knows something about show business.\"",
      "It was astounding, the speed with which it happened.",
      "Everywhere the Hank Snow\u2013headlined revue played, the clamor over Presley's performance only grew, and many nights he took the show. Hank Snow tried to hide his reaction, but Colonel could not help but be aware of it and all the ways his client's wounded vanity played out. The boy never seemed to notice, though; he clearly thought the world of Snow, and Colonel did all he could to smooth things over, pointing out that everywhere they went, they were breaking attendance records, which surely had to be considered a tribute to the star of the show.",
      "Things could not have been going better, in fact, for the new partnership between Colonel Tom Parker and Hank Snow. Record sales were up, and due to his assiduous efforts, Colonel never tired of reminding Snow, all sorts of new, high-paying opportunities in radio and television were starting to open up. The trades attributed these rapidly expanding horizons to a unique artist-manager relationship which Cash Box would describe as \"based on loyalty, mutual respect and a common objective,\" not to mention the uncommon efforts of Tom Parker, \"a colorful personality [with] a natural flair for showmanship [who is] known from coast to coast . . . and respected for his sound business principles [and his] policy of doing more than he has promised.\"",
      "But, tellingly, Colonel didn't book Elvis with Hank again until May, while Hank continued to do record-breaking business on his own.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks\u2014the principal stumbling block\u2014to his doing more with Presley was the boy's manager, Bob Neal, who seemed infuriatingly unsusceptible to persuasion, promotion, or even recognition of his own (let alone his artist's) ever-increasing opportunities. During a brief break from touring at the beginning of March, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin, clearly disheartened by his inability to make any headway with Neal. \"I don't see much use in wasting any [more] money or time on Presley till we know that they need us, and only when they contact us direct for help in some way.\" Things were slow in the business in general, he noted, but he had not given up on improving Hank's royalty situation with RCA, or maybe even moving him to his old friend Randy Wood's Dot label (though in all likelihood, here he was merely musing out loud, for his own and Tom Diskin's benefit, about something that would almost certainly have been little more than a negotiating ploy). Meanwhile, he thought he would set up another strong ten- or fifteen-day tour for Hank, \"keep getting special deals lined up,\" and focus on getting him another guest shot on TV with Perry Como.",
      "But as frustrated as he was by the Presley situation, he was not about to give up. Finally, on March 29, he was able to come to some sort of agreement with Bob Neal for a two-week series of one-nighters in Florida with Hank Snow, but he couldn't resist needling Neal while at the same time trying to steer him toward a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Neal had to pay more attention to business, he wrote with unfeigned indignation. He had to get the Colonel a complete supply of photos and records right away. And most important of all, the boy was never going to get anywhere so long as he was on Sun Records. \"I am finding out that in some places they have never heard of Elvis. . . . this I am not saying to knock, as you well know but to drive home the fact how sad it is that this boy does not get the spread he needs on his records.\" And when Neal failed at this task, as at every other, he wrote again\u2014and again.",
      "The Florida tour was a triumph beyond anything that could have been imagined.",
      "On the first date, in Daytona Beach on May 7, Mae Boren Axton, a forty-year-old high school English teacher and sometime songwriter from Jacksonville, who had been doing advance press work in the area for the Colonel for the last year or two, witnessed a kind of crowd reaction she had never seen before. A well-educated woman from a prominent political family in Oklahoma (her nephew David later became governor of the state and a three-term U.S. senator), she had grown up, she said, with \"no idea\" of what hillbilly music was, but she had come to like it from all the promotion work she had done for numerous hillbilly jamborees over the last few years. Now, in her capacity as Colonel's designated press officer, she undertook to conduct an interview with Elvis before the show, one of the first real interviews he had ever done, she imagined, judging from his polite, tongue-tied responses\u2014but then she was almost struck dumb herself by the altogether unexpected explosiveness of his act. At one point she ran across one of her former students while Elvis was still onstage, \"and she was just right into it, didn't know who he was, none of them did. But she was just ahhhh\u2014all of them were, even some of the old ones were doing like that. I looked at the faces\u2014they were loving it. And I said, 'Hey, honey, what is it about this kid?' And she said, 'Awww, Miz Axton, he's just a great big beautiful hunk of forbidden fruit.'\"",
      "In Orlando, four nights later, the crowd called for Elvis to come back when Hank Snow took the stage, and could not be quieted during Snow's performance. The reporter for the local paper, a complete neophyte to this kind of music (it provided \"a poignant contrast to Metropolitan Opera in Atlanta, I must say,\" she acknowledged to her readers), gave a reasonably enthusiastic account of the entire evening, \"but what really stole the show was this 20- year-old sensation, Elvis Presley, a real sex box as far as the teenage girls are concerned. They squealed themselves silly over this fellow in orange coat and sideburns who 'sent' them. . . . Following the program, Elvis was surrounded by girlies asking for autographs. He would give each a long, slow look with drooped eyelids and comply. They ate it up.\" Which evolved in the blink of an eye into a full-scale riot in Jacksonville, when, at the conclusion of his act, Elvis announced, \"Girls, I'll see you all backstage.\"",
      "\"I heard feet like a thundering herd,\" Mae Axton recalled, \"and the next thing I knew I heard this voice from the shower area, and Elvis was on top of one of the showers looking sheepish and scared, and his shirt was shredded and his coat was torn to pieces . . . he was up there with nothing but his pants on and they were trying to pull at them up on the shower.\" The Colonel, said Mae, \"and I don't mean it derogatorily, got dollar marks in his eyes.\"",
      "But I think even Mae would be willing to admit that this was a reductive picture of a man she had come to admire for both his intellect and determination. Because she could tell even then that from Colonel's perspective Elvis Presley was not just another passing fancy to be cashed in on and forgotten, he was, potentially, a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.",
      "Within days Colonel was hard at work trying to set up another Florida tour. Once again, Bob Neal's refusal, or simply inability, to take a businesslike approach was an obstacle, but one which Colonel was confident he could overcome. On May 25 he wrote to Neal in what could be taken as a lesson in coercive persuasion: \"I was most happy to do what I could to help Elvis and you in getting him across in these new markets. . . . I am always glad to work with both of you, I am not one of the type of personalities that tries to cut out a manager, as you well know a good many would do. . . . If ever you wish to tie in with me closely and let me carry the ball I will be happy to sit down with both of you and try to work it out.\" Evidently that must have struck a chord with Neal, who instantly initiated a phone call, which in turn prompted a second letter from Colonel, spelling out terms and conditions and laying out \"the protection I must have to enable [me] to tie these things up and not be fanning the air and spent my money foolish.\"",
      "He felt no need to mention it at the time, but the second Florida tour, scheduled to begin in just two months, would take place without the presence of Hank Snow. Snow instead would be heading up a West Coast tour of his own, his first all-out assault on that market, which would be operating under the direction of Tom Diskin and conclude with a triumphal appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Colonel made sure that Hank understood that he was not abdicating managerial responsibility, that every aspect of the tour would be plotted out by himself and Mr. Diskin, and that it would, of course, be fully supported by RCA. But in fact Hank couldn't have been more pleased, and if he were to be perfectly honest about it, he would not miss the presence of Presley in the least. And it wasn't as if he were losing anything on the deal. As a partner in Hank Snow Enterprises\u2013Jamboree Attractions, he stood only to gain by the addition of another big moneymaking tour in whose profits he would be a full participant.",
      "In the meantime, while fully engaged in the setup of both tours, Colonel continued to go back and forth with Bob Neal about the smallest, and largest, of matters. He dangled the promise of two weeks in Las Vegas (\"The [club] owner is a good friend of mine\"), which surely he would have had difficulty delivering on, but Neal didn't bite. He continued to hector Neal about his inattention to business (\"I have been waiting to hear from you,\" again, and again, and again), without any tangible results. Finally, he arranged to meet with Neal in person about a whole panoply of issues, including, once again, trying to shop Presley's record contract to a major label, about which he believed they had finally reached agreement, only to hear back from Neal three days later: \"Hold off any further announcements regarding Elvis until I have more time with him.\"",
      "On June 25, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin in what appears to be barely concealed, barely punctuated frustration. \"Get it in your mind that there is no future in anything but big deals, no small time stuff it takes as much time and no money can be made of it. You have to believe this so strongly that you will let no one get your time and ear on junk deals. Everytime we have become involved in something small [and here it is hard to believe that he is not for the first time wondering if this is how the whole Elvis experience will turn out] we have lost time money and get nowhere.\"",
      "Just how discouraged he must have been feeling is evident in the entirely unaccustomed rush of emotion that he pours into what he writes next to Diskin, with whom he has been working in perfect harmony for three years now without ever once communicating just how much the younger man's contributions have meant to him. \"The future looks very good for you if you want to make it that way,\" he writes, in a passage posing as well-meant advice for a junior partner who needs bucking up, but which could just as easily be taken as a confidence-building message to Colonel himself. \"I will always protect you all I can/and I know you do the same. You are good for me and I know that I do understand you better than any-one could. Your closer to me than any-one ever has been and will be. and I know you understand me.\"",
      "The return to Florida, beginning on July 25 and ending seven days later with a benefit show in Tampa sponsored by the Sertoma Club and Clyde Rinaldi, proved to be even more spectacular than the first tour. The all-star cast was headlined by comedian-actor Andy Griffith, but it was Elvis who took the show every night, astonishing not only the audience but his fellow performers. Once again there was a riot in Jacksonville in the course of which Elvis once again had his clothes torn off, something the Colonel made sure to mention two weeks later in an exhortatory letter to Sam Weisbord, one of William Morris' most senior West Coast agents.",
      "He was enclosing a set of action pictures he had had taken in Tampa, he wrote to Weisbord. (One of them would become the arresting cover of Elvis' first RCA album some eight months later.) He was also enclosing a selection of his records. \"He is presently on a small record label and they have sold this year over 100,000 of this boy's records already, and they have no distribution whatsoever. . . . This artist seems to me to be right in line for motion picture material, television, and a stage career. . . . With the right training and advice and good material the possibilities are unlimited. His exposure on the stage does 75% towards the public accepting this artist. The talents that are hidden in this personality are unlimited.\"",
      "He didn't hesitate to invoke Hank Snow, another well-regarded William Morris client, who \"has done much to expose the talents of ELVIS PRESLEY, as he has taken him more or less under his wing and has been plugging away on all his personals and blowing the bugle about ELVIS PRESLEY.\"",
      "And he summed it all up on a not altogether unexpected note. \"I can only go so far without the help of friends like you towards making the world aware of such great talent. You have forgotten more than I'll ever know about how to bring this out in an artist and I'm asking you for advice to carry on and get the best results out of and for ELVIS PRESLEY and all of us.\"",
      "He copied the letter to Harry Kalcheim, the head of William Morris' New York office, who had been instrumental in helping to broaden Eddy Arnold's appeal with key supper-club and television bookings. And he continued to bombard Steve Sholes at RCA with letters and telegrams, ostensibly under the guise of tipping him off to something that Colonel was good enough not to want him to miss.",
      "This might all be taken as Colonel's usual method of operation, of course\u2014and in many respects it was. But the lack of caution, the abandonment of all of his usual, carefully calibrated reserve, was something new. Certainly he had felt the same kind of full-blown belief in Eddy Arnold and the vast potential of his talent\u2014but he had always proceeded with an element of circumspection, taking each incremental step only after he was confident of the success of the last. With Presley he was making no such allowance for failure. If the boy failed, he was leaving himself nothing to fall back on. Because here it was not just Elvis Presley's musical talent that foretold an almost limitless future (though that may well have been enough in itself), it was his spongelike ability to absorb and reshape everything that he took in and experienced, his seemingly inexhaustible appetite for self-improvement. As Colonel would one day remark in comparing Presley's talent with that of Gene Austin, his first superstar, both were \"individual artists [who] have a feeling inside them for what they are doing which you can't teach anyone.\" And as he was quick to point out with more than just a smidgen of irony, \"I, as a salesman and drummer, know this [better] than the average guy.\"",

      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "summary": "The bestselling author had said she would no longer write novels set in the make-believe mountain village of Mitford. After the death of her daughter, she wrote through her grief \u2013 which led to her 15th Mitford book, \"My Beloved.\"",
    "story": [
      "For one weekend only, hundreds of devoted readers gathered in Hudson, North Carolina, to celebrate Mitford, a fictional place with a real sense of community. Jan Karon, the 88-year-old author behind Mitford, has written 15 books about the make-believe mountain village.",
      "Asked how to describe the town of Mitford, Karon said it is \"a place my readers can go and not be afraid. It's a place of refuge. It's where they can go, get a deep breath.\"",
      "The humanity of Karon's characters has found a faithful following that's perennially put her novels on the bestseller list. But for some people, she's not a household name like other bestselling authors. Asked why, Karon said, \"I don't give you much of a ride. I just give you sort of a float! A lot of people tell me that my books put them to sleep, and I consider that a huge compliment!\"",
      "Karon's super-fans say the books are more than page turners. According to Nellie McMasters, \"We are in such an uncertain period, we're in such turmoil, that it's just a nice, pleasant place.\"",
      "\"And it's not divisive,\" said Joellen Maurer. \"This is just love your neighbor, know the people who live around you.\"",
      "Asked if she believes places like Mitford exist in America today, Phyllis Farringer replied, \"They do, where there's a community of faith and people caring about each other, and I see it.\"",
      "Jan Karon was raised by her grandmother, Fannie, in Hudson, and attended elementary school there. Almost eight decades later, she converted the site to the Mitford Museum.",
      "She credits her first grade teacher Nan Downs with encouraging her creativity. By age 10, Karon says, she knew she wanted to be a writer: \"I stood in front of this very mirror, and I said, I'm going to be an author.\"",
      "How did she know? \"I just knew,\" Karon said. \"I love to read. And so, I wanted to give other people what I received from reading, which was that whole other world.\"",
      "At 14, Karon found herself wanting to escape her world, so she got married, dropped out of school, and gave birth to her daughter, Candace, a year later. She was divorced at 18.",
      "\"A lot of it was really hard, because I became a single mom and had to raise her by myself when I myself had hardly been raised,\" she said.",
      "She worked a series of jobs, including TV producer. She was later fired, and says that was her turning point: \"It brought me to my knees; I'd never been on my knees,\" Karon said. \"I was 42. I just went down: I don't know what to pray for. I'm just here, and I need help and just change me.\"",
      "She became a successful advertising executive, but says she felt called to write more than ads. So, she quit her job, and began weaving her faith into her short stories. She published her work for free in a local newspaper, eventually turning those tales into her first Mitford novel, \"At Home in Mitford,\" in 1994.",
      "I asked, \"I think that when people think about your books and your work, they often think comforting, they think maybe clean, Christian.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful for my Christian readers, very grateful,\" Karon said. \"But I write for a secular audience. God poured his love into me, and you can't say, well, I just can't talk about that in my books.\"",
      "Her latest Mitford work, \"My Beloved,\" is all about presence, aging, and connection. Karon says it was one of the most challenging things she's ever written \u2013 and comes after having said she would never write another Mitford book.",
      "In 2008, she began a short story set during Christmas, but it sat unfinished for more than a decade. In 2021, her daughter, Candace, died of cancer. Karon was moved to write through her grief. The finished work, now a novel, is dedicated to her daughter,",
      "\"She was the sunshine of my life,\" Karon said of Candace.",
      "I asked, \"Do you ever talk to her while you're sitting here writing?\"",
      "\"All the time,\" she replied. \"And I know this sounds corny, but it's true for me, right here, she'll say, 'I hear you, Mom. It's okay, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right.'\"",
      "\"How did losing Candace change your life?\"",
      "\"I'm less judgmental,\" Karon replied. \"I'm a little easier, even on myself. And I've always been really hard on myself. I know that we don't have forever anymore, which is a thing in this book. So, what can we do with this time? Something better than what we're doing? Or even just something more fun? We don't have to be noble all the time.\"",
      "Jan Karon invites us to look for community and neighborly love, to find our own kind of Mitford. \"If you will just get in your car and drive out into America, I'm telling you, I can guarantee, I promise you, that it is out there. You have to look for it. It's not going to come to you and sit on your doorstep. You've got to go out and get it, and it's there for the taking.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

    "story": [
      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

    "summary": "President Trump is hosting the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday after presenting medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees during an Oval Office ceremony Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0ignored the Kennedy Center\u00a0and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has\u00a0instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who\u00a0voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances\u00a0and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "In a presidential first, Mr. Trump is hosting the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0himself on Sunday.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors program\u00a0and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be\u00a0broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said Sunday as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",

    "published": "Sat, 06 Dec 2025 08:07:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Nardiz Cooke was immediately transfixed by the mask she wore while receiving treatment for late-stage cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-affordability-speech-economy-pennsylvania/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",

    "summary": "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Philanthropist and billionaire MacKenzie Scott announced Tuesday she has given $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits so far in 2025, a major increase over her recent yearly contributions.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\"",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in February showed that Scott has donated to more than 2,000 nonprofits, and the median size was roughly $5 million.",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public-facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\"One of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\" Gasman told the Associated Press, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "Scott's recent donations to HBCU's include $50 million to\u00a0Norfolk State University, $63 million to\u00a0Prairie View A&M University\u00a0and $50 million to\u00a0Bowie State University.",
      "On Friday, Scott donated $25 million to Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \"mission aligned\" investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",
      "In her 2025 essay, Scott seemed to urge people toward action, writing, \"There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.\"",

    "summary": "Beating back inflation is only half the battle in lowering the cost of living \u2014 you also have to think about people's pay, economists argue.",
    "story": [
      "Mounting public attention on the struggle millions of Americans face affording food, housing and other daily necessities has largely centered on what can be done to quash inflation. Yet some economists say the discussion is incomplete without addressing another major reason life has become unaffordable for so many people: their\u00a0meager paychecks.",
      "\"It's not just about how much things cost. Affordability is truly about, 'Does an individual have enough money to buy the things they want?' So it's not about making things cheaper, but making it so you earn more so that the stuff you need is affordable,\" Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday evening is expected to address cost-of-living concerns and other economic issues at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pa. Although he has at times dismissed claims that the U.S. faces an affordability crisis, his administration has also taken steps to offer relief.",
      "In November, for example, Mr. Trump removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. The president last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "\"Your money doesn't go as far\"",
      "To be sure, controlling inflation is critical, as well as an explicit aim under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to keep both unemployment and prices in check. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, describes prices and wages as \"two sides of the same coin.\"",
      "\"You can achieve the same standard of living by either raising wages or lowering costs or both,\" he added. \"So it is important to deal with cost-of-living issues if you want to improve living standards, but raising wages also works.\"",
      "Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Department of Labor under Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017, thinks a better way to make life more affordable is to raise worker wages so their dollars stretch further. She also favors providing government subsidies to help ease the burden of affording essential \u2014 and increasingly costly \u2014 services such as child care and health care.",
      "One-third of middle-class families struggle to afford housing\u00a0and child care, according to a recent\u00a0report from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford things beyond the bare essentials, according to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. The research firm has found that the bottom 60% of income earners in the U.S. have difficulty affording expenses such as higher education, transportation and even the basic technology required for their jobs.",
      "\"There are some things that feel out of reach that didn't feel like they were out of reach in the past,\" said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Your money doesn't go as far as it used to.\"",
      "Why prices may not drop much",
      "Economists note that prices don't generally decline broadly unless the economy is in a recession, with presidential administrations and even the Fed having a limited toolkit for addressing severe bouts of inflation. Meanwhile, a sharp, across-the-board drop in prices can indicate a dangerous erosion in consumer demand, leading to an economic downturn.",
      "\"Overall, it's very rare and not a good thing to have outright deflation across the economy,\" the Cato Institute's Lincicome told CBS News.",
      "Indeed, millions of people would have to lose their jobs, and then cut their spending, for demand to slow enough for companies to broadly reduce their prices, according to Shierholz.",
      "\"In order to bring the overall price level down, you have to have a massive recession because people are not demanding stuff, because they don't have any income,\" she added. \"That's how you get a drop in the overall price level.\"",
      "Affordability fixes?",
      "Shierholz favors a range of policies for driving both short- and long-term wage growth. First and foremost, the U.S. could boost the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "Local governments aren't waiting around for the feds to take action, with dozens of states in recent years adopting higher baseline wages. In 2026,\u00a0minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 19 states and 49 cities and counties starting on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.",
      "Reforming labor laws to make it easier for workers to form a union can also lead to higher wages for workers, Shieholz said. Equally important, in her view, is providing a robust social safety net. That includes providing ample unemployment insurance benefits so workers who lose their jobs can stay afloat financially.",
      "\"That actually raises wages because it gives workers power,\" she said. \"By contrast, if your employer knows you'll drop into poverty if you give up or lose your job, you're going to be much less able to make any risky demands.\"",
      "The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonpartisan group focused on economic equality, also argues in a new report\u00a0that expanding unemployment insurance benefits helps low-income workers find better-paying jobs.",
      "Although surging employee pay can fuel inflation under certain conditions, De Rugy of the Mercatus Center said that rising wages rooted in strong economic growth \"actually improves affordability, because it tends to shift the bargaining power toward employees.\"",
      "To ease housing costs, progressive economists also support policies like freezing the rent and offering financial incentives to homebuilders to put up more affordable housing.",
      "Other experts also underline the importance of providing low-cost child care as a key part of solving the affordability puzzle for U.S. families.\u00a0Child care costs today exceed\u00a0the cost of rent in dozens of cities, according to a recent LendingTree analysis. Households spend an average of $1,282 per month for full-time child care for one child and $2,252 for two kids, the lending marketplace found.",
      "Some states are leading the way to ease child care costs, showing that progress is possible given sufficient political will. In November,\u00a0New Mexico became the first U.S. state to offer free universal child care to residents, with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham telling CBS News it would save families an average of $12,000 a year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-december-10-meeting/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:53:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce if they will cut rates again in December's meeting \u2014 their last meeting of 2025. The decision will determine whether borrowers get more relief on interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve will announce whether to cut interest rates at its December meeting, capping off a turbulent year for the U.S. economy defined by fresh labor market headwinds and tariff-fueled inflation that has deepened the nation's affordability crunch.",
      "The U.S. central bank will have to make its decision without some key government data. Hiring data for November and the latest inflation number have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Fed's meeting \u2014 because of the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "Those two measures are key to the Fed's decision-making on interest rates because of its so-called dual mandate, which is to keep both inflation and unemployment low. Those goals have proved difficult to reconcile this year amid a slowdown in hiring and a spike in layoffs, while inflation has edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Economists expect another quarter-point cut",
      "Despite the conflicting data, most economists are penciling in an interest-rate cut at the December 10 meeting.",
      "CME FedWatch, which assesses the probability of rate moves based on futures pricing data, puts the odds of another 0.25 percentage-point cut in the Fed's benchmark rate at 88%. That would represent the third straight Fed cut and lower the federal funds rate, or what banks charge each other for short-term loans, to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.",
      "A rate cut this week could help some borrowers by reducing the cost of their loans, from credit card APRs to home equity lines of credit. That could bolster U.S. households at a time when many Americans report still feeling pinched by the rising cost of food, health care and other everyday expenses.",
      "\"Another Fed rate cut to close an unnervingly uncertain year is good news for borrowers,\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz told CBS News. \"The accumulated savings from the Fed's moves are starting to add up to real money.\"",
      "Credit card rates are now at their lowest since April 2023, and are continuing to fall, Schulz added. Another rate cut on Dec. 10 would mark the sixth reduction since September 2024, with those cuts amounting to hundreds of dollars in savings for many borrowers, he added.",
      "Although official economic data has been delayed, Fed officials will be looking at other data sources, such as the ADP National Employment Report, which tracks private payrolls. Its November data shows employers shed 32,000 jobs, a signal the labor market is continuing to face headwinds.",
      "\"The absence of recent inflation data leaves the Federal Reserve operating with limited visibility, while alternative labor indicators and political pressure are steering the committee toward a more accommodative policy stance,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email.",
      "President Trump and other administration officials have chastised Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year about not moving sooner to ratchet back interest rates.",
      "Another Fed rate cut carries its own risks. Lowering borrowing costs can spur consumers and businesses to spend more, potentially fueling higher inflation, Kates noted.",
      "A Fed divided",
      "Although economists expect the Fed to approve a rate cut on Wednesday, not all members of the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the central bank's 12-member rate-setting panel \u2014 are expected to support the move.",
      "Several FOMC members have recently spoken publicly in support of cutting rates, including Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams, who last month said the labor market's weakness outweighs concerns about inflation. In October, however, Powell\u00a0cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "\"It's difficult to recall a time when the Federal Open Market Committee has been so evenly divided about the need for additional rate cuts than the upcoming December meeting,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"It's a close call, but on balance we expect the committee to vote to lower rates\" by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Are more rate cuts coming in 2026?",
      "For consumers, businesses and investors, perhaps the biggest question on Wednesday is whether policymakers will hint at more rate cuts for 2026.",
      "For now, economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting on Jan. 27-28, according to a poll by FactSet. The survey of economists shows a 62% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged next month.",
      "Even so, economists are generally forecasting more rate cuts for 2026, although the timing remains uncertain. The Fed could wait until March to make its first cut of the year because inflation remains above its 2% annual target, according to Maxime Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.",
      "But the labor market remains a wild card, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report. Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020 and a 54% increase from the same period a year ago, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers are relying more on artificial intelligence, with some companies\u00a0saying they're cutting jobs as AI makes their workforce more efficient. A continuation of that trend could lead to weaker hiring or even a spike in layoffs in 2026, supporting the argument for more rate cuts next year, Goldman said.",
      "\"[W]e see this as the greatest uncertainty and the most important question for 2026: Will somewhat firmer growth really be enough to stabilize a labor market where job growth outside of health care has been running negative recently and companies are increasingly focused on using AI to cut labor costs?\" Goldman analysts wrote.",

    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:03:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Genesis HealthCare's bankruptcy case in Dallas will allow the nursing home chain to avoid paying millions of dollars it promised for residents who were injured or died while in its care.",
    "story": [
      "Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.",
      "Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a \"significant\" factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt's son signed in August 2024.",
      "Yet Genesis hasn't paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.",
      "Once the nation's largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.",
      "The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.",
      "When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.",
      "As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.",
      "\"It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,\" said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2014 an injury the medical examiner's report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt's family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.",
      "Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained \"focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption\" during bankruptcy.",
      "One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident's behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer's patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.",
      "Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company's owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis' new ownership and other companies they blame for the company's collapse.",
      "John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, \"They never had any intention to honor these deals.\"",
      "Low ratings and fines",
      "During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.",
      "In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.",
      "In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.",
      "The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.",
      "Dangers in memory care",
      "Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.",
      "Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer's in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded \"shut up bitch I know you like this,\" according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.",
      "Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident's behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, \"I want to have sex with you.\" When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, \"Shhh.\"",
      "The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. \"don't sing anymore.\"",
      "Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn't provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.' lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"We just felt we have to hold them accountable,\" R.S.' daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. \"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?\"",
      "Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family's claim filing.",
      "Growth and debt",
      "Genesis' downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.",
      "In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis' bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.",
      "Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis' bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and \"mired in corporate inefficiencies.\" Robichaux wrote that Genesis' financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the COVID pandemic.",
      "Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux's filing.",
      "But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised \"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"",
      "In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee's Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and \"siphon value to himself.\" The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while \"staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.\" Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Drawn-out lawsuits",
      "Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson's lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.",
      "After the judge rejected Genesis' request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2\u00bd years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.",
      "This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "\"It was so drawn out and for so long,\" Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis' bankruptcy \"despicable.\"",
      "Payouts postponed",
      "Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson's, said the company frequently filed appeals. \"They did not usually win them on these issues,\" she said, \"and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.\"",
      "Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote's law partner. \"The payments wouldn't start for several months out,\" Harvey said. Foote said Genesis' lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.",
      "Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis' settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.",
      "Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.",
      "A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy \u2014 21 months after the case was resolved \u2014 it still owed $100,000, according to the family's claim.",
      "\"We never found out the truth\"",
      "Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"It looked like she was hit by a truck,\" Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. \"I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.\"",
      "The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson's jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.",
      "\"We never found out the truth,\" Harley said. \"They wanted to settle out of court.\"",
      "The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson's five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.",
      "\"If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,\" Harley said.",
      "Maddening judges",
      "By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.",
      "Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate's lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown's estate or explain the delay.",
      "Genesis \"obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,\" McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. \"They assure me that they're not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven't lived up to what the bargain was.\"",
      "Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.",
      "In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing \"unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.\" Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.",
      "Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt's claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt's lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.",
      "Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.",
      "\"Bankruptcy as a tool\"",
      "In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.",
      "Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.",
      "\"Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,\" Rafatjoo said. \"A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.\"",
      "On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau's favor despite an \"objectively better and higher competing bid\" from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau's group had increased its bid during the auction.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee's Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that \"individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.\" Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.",
      "\"They can file bankruptcy again,\" said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. \"And we're the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.\"",

    "summary": "Homeownership can feel like a luxury when only a sliver of the country's housing market is affordable for most Americans, Bankrate analyst says.",
    "story": [
      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010. The U.S. needs 4.7 million housing units to keep up with demand, according to a July analysis from Zillow, an online real estate marketplace.",
      "In 2024 (the latest date for which figures are available), the median household income in the U.S. after adjusting for inflation was nearly $84,000, according to Census data. That is far less than the $113,000 in annual income needed to buy a typical home, which now costs around $435,000, according to Bankrate.",
      "In the country's priciest cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle, households must earn at least $200,000 a year to afford the median-priced home.",
      "As of 2025, about 65% of U.S. households owned their own home, down from a peak of more than 69% in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "By contrast, in some parts of the South and West, where home construction has picked up in some markets, there are glimmers of hope, Gailey said, pointing to stronger tax incentives and looser permitting requirements as policies that could boost construction.",
      "\"Those regions have brighter outlooks than the Northeast and Midwest, where building has lagged, and inventory levels remain well below pre-pandemic norms,\" she said.",
      "Aspiring homebuyers could see some relief in 2026. Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from the 6.6% average in 2025, according to Realtor.com.",

      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",

      "China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing more than half of all American exports of the crop in the last five years, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a preliminary\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0in October, which the White House said involved the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China. The White House said\u00a0in November that China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans in the last two months of 2025.",
      "However, Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans could fall short of what the country normally purchases, CBS News correspondent Lana Zak\u00a0reported in November.",

Prices of the crops have fallen in the last two years, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation, an advocacy organization.",
      "Bessent said on Face the Nation on Sunday that domestic soybean prices have risen as much as 15% since the agreement with the Chinese.",
      "The Trump administration started considering\u00a0a financial aid package for farmers\u00a0in October, with sources telling CBS News that it could include more than $10 billion in relief.

Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros.

      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",

      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",

      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",

    "summary": "Minimum wages are set to rise in 22 U.S. states and 66 cities and counties next year, even as the federal baseline wage remains at $7.25.",
    "story": [
      "Some workers will receive pay boosts next year as higher minimum wage regulations take effect in 22 states and 66 cities and counties across the U.S., a change that could help low-income households grappling with an\u00a0affordability crisis.",
      "On Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum wage is set to rise in 19 states and 49 cities and counties, for a total of 68 jurisdictions, according to a report from the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy organization for workers.",
      "Later in the year, an additional four states and 22 cities will boost their baseline wages, providing more relief to the lowest-paid U.S. workers, according to the group's analysis.",
      "Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the federal wage floor remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has been stuck since 2009. Given the rise in the cost of living in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have chosen to boost their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"Policies increasing the minimum wage have been a lifeline for underpaid workers who have been the most impacted by a growing affordability crisis,\" the NELP report states.",
      "Here's where minimum wages will rise in 2026:",
      "Jan. 1 minimum wage increases",
      "Beginning Jan. 1, workers in 60 jurisdictions will earn a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour. In three states and 40 localities, the minimum wage for some or all employers will reach or exceed $17 an hour.",
      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation is waiving part of a fine assessed against Southwest Airlines after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022.",
      "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty. The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.",
      "Most of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "The department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.",
      "\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"",
      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.",
      "Even before the settlement, the nation's fourth-biggest airline by revenue said the meltdown cost it more than $1.1 billion in refunds and reimbursements, extra costs and lost ticket sales over several months.",

      "About 210,000 portable lithium-ion battery power banks sold on Amazon have been recalled over possible fire and burn hazards to consumers, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.",
      "The recall involves INIU 100,000mAh portable power banks, model BI-B41that were sold on Amazon between August 2021 and April 2022, the recall notice says. They have a black or blue case with the INIU logo and a paw-print LED light on the front.",
      "The power banks can overheat and ignite. The company said it received at least 15 reports of the power banks overheating, including 11 reports of fires that resulted in minor burn injuries and property damage.",
      "Only the portable power banks with serial numbers 000G21, 000H21, 000I21 and 000L21 are included in this recall.",
      "People who purchased the power banks should stop using them immediately and visit INIU's website recall page to verify the product serial number and register for a full refund.",
      "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in a range of products, including electronics, appliances, cordless tools and electric bikes, and their usage has been linked to\u00a0numerous incidents\u00a0of overheating and fires.",
      "Consumers should stop using products with lithium-ion batteries if they detect an odor, a change in color, excessive heat, a change in shape, leaking or odd noises, according to the National Fire Protection Association.",
      "Because of their risk of catching fire, lithium-ion batteries cannot be thrown out in the trash, curbside bins, or even battery recycling boxes. The CPSC recommends consumers contact their municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center for guidance on how to properly dispose of their recalled lithium-ion battery or device.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 19:55:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 17:01:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"It's very discouraging,\" said one young job-seeker as employers pull back on hiring entry-level workers.",
    "story": [
      "Angel Escobedo started looking for work a year and a half ago, even before completing his college degree at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Now, with less than a week to go before graduation and having applied to more than 150 jobs, he's still searching.",
      "Escobedo's predicament illustrates the challenges that many young Americans, even those with impressive academic records, are having entering the nation's workforce amid a broad decline in job listings and as they compete with more experienced people.",
      "\"They're sort of missing out on the ability to jump into the labor market,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It's not a new phenomenon, but it is a concerning phenomenon.\"",
      "For young adults eager to start their careers, the obstacles can seem daunting. Escobedo, 22, has had multiple professional internships during his college career and also completed a management training program at Harvard Business School. The Illinois resident, who is seeking a job in finance or business operations, said he has found the job search process \"very discouraging,\" noting that he's open to just about any kind of employment.",
      "Gen Z job applicants, like other workers, are also having to navigate a quickly changing job-hunting landscape in which employers increasingly use AI and self-recorded video interviews to screen candidates. Job seekers told CBS News that while it's easy to apply for work, finding ways to stand out is hard, while the new tech adds a new layer of complexity.",
      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

      "Former Miami-Dade County Commissioner\u00a0Eileen Higgins\u00a0won Miami's mayoral runoff election Tuesday, marking the first time in nearly\u00a030 years that the city has elected a Democrat as mayor.",
      "Higgins secured 59% of the vote versus former Miami City Manager\u00a0Emilio Gonzalez's nearly 41%, according to\u00a0unofficial results\u00a0from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections. The win marks an end to a\u00a0competitive race\u00a0that began with a crowded 13-person field.",
      "\"Our city chose a new direction,\" Higgins told the cheering crowd at her election night celebration. \"You chose competence over chaos, results over excuses and a city government that finally works for you.\"",
      "The campaign centered on issues such as immigration, housing, flooding, city growth and the tone of leadership Miami needs. Higgins and Gonzalez faced off in a CBS News Miami debate moderated by Jim DeFede on Nov. 25, giving voters a chance to compare their visions for the city.",
      "While the race was officially nonpartisan, Higgins had the backing of prominent Democrats, while Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Trump, endorsed Gonzalez.",
      "Out of 175,692 registered voters, 37,496 cast ballots on Tuesday, a turnout of 21.3%, according to official records.",
      "Higgins' vision for Miami",
      "Higgins served eight years on the Miami-Dade County Commission and campaigned on restoring public trust and bringing what she described as calmer, more collaborative leadership to City Hall.\u00a0Affordable housing\u00a0was a cornerstone of her platform. She pledged to utilize city-owned land to build housing for working families and criticized Miami's rapid growth without corresponding improvements in services.",
      "She also called for a full review of city spending and proposed updating regulations to allow permeable pavement and accelerate park construction to improve drainage citywide. Higgins supports\u00a0expanding the City Commission\u00a0from five to nine members, arguing that Miami's legislative body is unusually small compared to other major cities and leaves many communities underrepresented.",
      "On\u00a0immigration enforcement, Higgins voiced strong concerns, calling recent actions in Miami \"inhumane and cruel.\"",
      "Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground, but told CBS News, \"When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.\"",
      "Higgins celebrates historic victory",
      "Cheers inside a Miami ballroom grew louder as Higgins stepped to the microphone Tuesday night, newly elected as the city's next mayor.",
      "\"Well, we did it!\" she exclaimed, drawing another round of applause.",
      "Higgins framed the night as a turning point for Miami and reminded supporters that the celebration was also a call to action.",
      "\"This isn't just a celebration but also a promise because Miami is facing real challenges, and tonight marks the beginning of the work ahead,\" Higgins said.",
      "She pledged to move Miami forward.",
      "\"No more endless delays for families trying to fix a home or small business trying to open,\" Higgins said. \"We will cut red tape, repair what's broken and modernize City Hall. We will confront the affordability crisis with the urgency Miami families need. We will make our streets safer by supporting law enforcement and strengthening community partnerships. We will protect Biscayne Bay.\"",
      "Her vision was inclusive.",
      "\"We will lead a city that belongs to everyone,\" she said to cheers.",
      "\"A city where seniors can stay, younger people can build a future, immigrants feel welcome and respected,\" she added, as the crowd roared again.",
      "Higgins also noted that she had spoken with her opponent.",
      "\"I just spoke with my opponent Emilio Gonzalez, a good man that I've known for many, many years and genuinely respect,\" Higgins said. \"He cares about our community; that is what unites us.\"",
      "Prominent Miami figures joined Higgins at the celebration, including Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, Miami Police Chief Manny Morales, County Commissioner Oliver Gilbert III, Opa-locka Mayor John Taylor and Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried, underscoring the historic nature of Higgins' win.",
      "Gonzalez concedes, reflects on lawsuit",
      "Before delivering his concession speech, Gonzalez called Higgins directly.",
      "\"We respect you, and we will give you all the latitude you need to do great things,\" Gonzalez told her.",
      "Even as he conceded, Gonzalez acknowledged the legal battle that made Tuesday's vote possible. His lawsuit, filed in July 2025, challenged the City of Miami's decision to postpone the mayoral election until 2026.",
      "Asked Tuesday if he felt the lawsuit was worth it, Gonzalez replied: \"Absolutely, listen, think of the irony. I filed a lawsuit to have an election that I participated in and lost. OK? That should tell you that it's much bigger than me.\"",
      "He had argued the postponement was unconstitutional and disenfranchised voters, saying only the electorate had the authority to change the date. A judge agreed, ruling the city's vote to delay was void and unconstitutional. That decision ensured the election went forward in 2025, ultimately leading to the runoff between Gonzalez and Higgins.",
      "Levine Cava hails historic milestone",
      "Miami\u2011Dade County Mayor Levine Cava congratulated Higgins, noting that Higgins is the first woman ever elected mayor of Miami.",
      "In a statement, Levine Cava called the win a milestone for representation and said voters sent a clear message that they are tired of chaos, corruption and rising costs.",
      "She pledged to work alongside Higgins to deliver a city that \"works for everyone.\"",
      "\"For nearly 130 years since Julia Tuttle founded this city, Miami has never elected a woman as mayor,\" Levine Cava said. \"That changes tonight.\"",
      "What's next?",

      "Much of national Democrats' attention in next year's midterms is centered on working to flip control of the U.S. House and win consequential races for governor. But some in the party have zeroed in on less talked-about elections, in presidential battlegrounds and ruby-red states around the country, that could prove less costly and have a far-reaching impact at a time when the Democratic brand has grown wearisome with some voters.",
      "Democrats' state legislative campaign arm is outlining a potential path \"to flip more than 650 state legislative seats\" across a range of states. A major focus is on races in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona, and the group is aiming to curtail GOP power in places like Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Ohio, where Republican control has been impactful.",
      "\"The favorable political environment taking shape for Democrats is on a scale that only comes once in a generation,\" a new memo from Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee president Heather Williams says, while also outlining that a \"first priority right now is to fund and invest early in our battleground states as part of our $50 million power expansion strategy to win on this map.\"",
      "When pressed for details, a spokesperson told CBS News that $50 million is the group's \"estimated budget,\" but \"we also still have a lot of work ahead to raise the full amount.\"",
      "Democrats have lost around 800 state legislative seats over the last 15 years, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, significantly weakening their power in capitals nationwide.",
      "Governors on the left in Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina contend with GOP-controlled legislatures, and Democrats only control one chamber of the legislature in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota.",
      "But races up and down the ballot in November 2026 may prove difficult for Republicans given the political rebuke that the president's party usually faces in a midterm cycle. And while 2024 was a strong year for the GOP, legislative elections this year in Virginia and New Jersey have given Democrats hope.",
      "Republicans are attempting to push back against the national narrative that Democrats have an edge in next year's midterms.",
      "\"After historic losses in 2024, we knew the Democrats were going to come into this next cycle prepared. Their strategy of leaning on emotion, money, and machine politics to claw back short-term momentum will not last,\" Edith Jorge-Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said in a November 2025 memo.",
      "Republicans have seen firsthand how statehouse majorities can prove critical in Washington in recent months, as GOP\u00a0 leaders in North Carolina, Missouri and Texas redraw their congressional maps mid-decade in an attempt to help Republicans keep at least a narrow majority in the U.S. House.",
      "Over the years, Democrats have wrestled with reduced sway in a range of states, giving way to fears of a depleted bench of candidates to run in higher-profile races where money and a flashy campaign can't match the kind of goodwill built up in communities through years of elected service.",
      "Within states where that pipeline does exist, candidate quality has made a profound difference at times for Democrats.",
      "In the reliably Republican state of Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has won two terms in distinctly different political environments after having served as a state senator.",
      "In Michigan, the constant presidential battleground where political power pivots back and forth, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer served in both the state House and state Senate before being elected statewide for the first time in 2018.",
      "And in the politically divided commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro was a representative years before he became a political heavyweight now seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028.",
      "\"State legislative Democrats are local elected officials who are very close to their communities and very close to voters,\" Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in an interview. \"We are able to deliver an aspect of the Democratic brand and the Democratic storytelling that is better than anyone else, because it is rooted in everyday, regular conversations and needs.\"",
      "One of the major aspects of next year's midterms that has gone less talked-about is how strong President Trump's own influence will prove to be in a year when he isn't running for office himself.",
      "In presidential election years, the president and his orbit have shown a strong ability to upend political trends and bring out voters who may have chosen to stay at home with another candidate. Whether Republicans can inspire those kinds of voters without him on the ballot is a lingering question and one that is especially urgent for the GOP after Mr. Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and other presidential battleground states during his last White House run.",
      "\"Republicans underperformed at the top of the ticket in areas where President Trump excelled in 2024 \u2013 a clear reminder that authenticity and engagement drive enthusiasm,\" Jorge-Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said in the group's 2025 post-election memo.",
      "It's far from certain that Democrats will be able to make the gains outlined by the statehouse-focused Democratic campaign committee. But doing so could have widespread impacts, with the political outfit outlining in the memo the chance to not only flip Republican-held chambers in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, but also potentially defeat Republican supermajorities in 10 states.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of people in the state of Wisconsin that showed up for Donald Trump that now have buyer's remorse,\" Wisconsin Senate Democratic leader Dianne Hesselbein said.",

    "summary": "Under Rod Paige's leadership, the Department of Education implemented the No Child Left Behind policy that in 2002 became former President George W. Bush's signature education law.",
    "story": [
      "Rod Paige, an educator, coach and administrator who rolled out the nation's landmark No Child Left Behind law as the first African American to serve as U.S. education secretary, died Tuesday.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, who tapped Paige for the nation's top federal education post, announced the death in a statement but did not provide further details. Paige was 92.",
      "Under Paige's leadership, the Department of Education implemented No Child Left Behind policy that in 2002 became Bush's signature education law and was modeled on Paige's previous work as a schools superintendent in Houston. The law established universal testing standards and sanctioned schools that failed to meet certain benchmarks.",
      "\"Rod was a leader and a friend,\" Bush said in his statement. \"Unsatisfied with the status quo, he challenged what we called 'the soft bigotry of low expectations.' Rod worked hard to make sure that where a child was born didn't determine whether they could succeed in school and beyond.\"",
      "Roderick R. Paige was born to two teachers in the small Mississippi town of Monticello of roughly 1,400 inhabitants. The oldest of five siblings, Paige served a two-year stint the U.S. Navy before becoming a football coach at the high school, and then junior college levels. Within years, Paige rose to head coach of Jackson State University, his alma mater and a historically Black college in the Mississippi capital city.",
      "There, his team became the first \u2014 with a 1967 football game \u2014 to integrate Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, once an all-White venue.",
      "After moving to Houston in the mid-1970s to become head coach of Texas Southern University, Paige pivoted from the playing field to the classroom and education \u2014 first as a teacher, and then as administrator and eventually the dean of its college of education from 1984 to 1994.",
      "Amid growing public recognition of his pursuit of educational excellence, Paige rose to become superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, then one of the largest school districts in the country.",
      "He quickly drew the attention of Texas' most powerful politicians for his sweeping educational reforms in the diverse Texas city. Most notably, he moved to implement stricter metrics for student outcomes, something that became a central point for Bush's 2000s bid for president. Bush \u2014 who later would dub himself the \"Education President\" \u2014 frequently praised Paige on the campaign trail for the Houston reforms he called the \"Texas Miracle.\"",
      "And once Bush won election, he tapped Paige to be the nation's top education official.",
      "As education secretary from 2001 to 2005, Paige emphasized his belief that high expectations were essential for childhood development.",
      "\"The easiest thing to do is assign them a nice little menial task and pat them on the head,\" he told the Washington Post at the time. \"And that is precisely what we don't need. We need to assign high expectations to those people, too. In fact, that may be our greatest gift: expecting them to achieve, and then supporting them in their efforts to achieve.\"",
      "While some educators applauded the law for standardizing expectations regardless of student race or income, others complained for years about what they consider a maze of redundant and unnecessary tests and too much \"teaching to the test\" by educators.",
      "In 2015, House and Senate lawmakers agreed to pull back many provisions from \"No Child Left Behind,\" shrinking the Education Department's role in setting testing standards and preventing the federal agency from sanctioning schools that fail to improve. That year, then-President Barack Obama signed the sweeping education law overhaul, ushering in a new approach to accountability, teacher evaluations and the way the most poorly performing schools are pushed to improve.",
      "After serving as education secretary, Paige returned to Jackson State University a half century after he was a student there, serving as the interim president in 2016 at the age of 83.",
      "Into his 90s, Paige still publicly expressed deep concern, and optimism, about the future of U.S. education. In an opinion piece appearing in the Houston Chronicle in 2024, Paige lifted up the city that helped propel him to national prominence, urging readers to \"look to Houston not just for inspiration, but for hard-won lessons about what works, what doesn't and what it takes to shake up a stagnant system.\"",

      "Six months after stepping down from leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire Elon Musk suggested he likely would not repeat his time helming the controversial cost-cutting mission.",
      "Musk discussed his time at the White House in a nearly hourlong podcast interview with former Trump administration aide Katie Miller that was released Tuesday. Asked if he believes DOGE was successful, Musk responded that it was \"a little bit successful.\"",
      "\"We were somewhat successful,\" the world's richest man said, adding that he believes the initiative \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\" and was \"entirely wasteful.\"",
      "Miller asked Musk if he would repeat his time leading the cost-cutting initiative, knowing what he knows now. He demurred before saying: \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would've basically\u2026worked in my companies, essentially.\"",
      "He continued: \"They wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" referring to a series of arson and vandalism incidents that hit dealerships for Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla.",
      "Named after an internet meme, DOGE was formed\u00a0just hours\u00a0after President Trump was sworn in. Musk, who\u00a0spent hundreds of millions\u00a0supporting Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, quickly became a\u00a0near-ubiquitous presence\u00a0at the White House.",
      "Musk and his young team at DOGE quickly tore through the executive branch, shutting down programs that they found wasteful and pushing for massive reductions to the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and voluntary buyouts. In some cases, entire agencies \u2014 including the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 were effectively shuttered.",
      "Musk has suggested the effort could save the government hundreds of billions, and possibly $2 trillion, though some of the cost savings figures touted by DOGE have been called into question.",
      "His aggressive approach \u2014 epitomized by a February event in which he waved around a chainsaw, calling it \"the chainsaw for bureaucracy\" \u2014 had its share of detractors, including federal workers who faced layoffs and disruptions, and Democratic lawmakers who argued the initiative was wielding vast power without approval from Congress. Lawsuits were filed to halt some of the cuts. Musk defended DOGE, arguing the government needs to slash its spending.",
      "Musk and the Mr. Trump's once-close relationship ruptured shortly after the Tesla CEO left the White House in late May. In a public back-and-forth, Musk attacked the president in personal terms and criticized his signature tax legislation, and Mr. Trump threatened to cut off lucrative federal subsidies for Tesla and Musk's rocket company SpaceX.",
      "Musk has also flirted with launching his own political party \u2014 though his plans are unclear.",
      "The two have appeared to at least partially mend their relationship since then, with Musk visiting the White House last month for a dinner with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.",
      "Asked last week if Musk is back in his circle of friends, Mr. Trump said, \"I like Elon a lot,\" before suggesting that their rift was due to cuts to electric vehicle subsidies.",
      "\"I think we get along well,\" the president added.",
      "And Musk, for his part, told Miller in his podcast interview that Mr. Trump is the funniest person he knows.",
      "\"He's got a great sense of humor,\" he said, pointing to the president's\u00a0Oval Office banter\u00a0with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \"It's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan group of former federal ethics officials is asking for an internal Justice Department investigation into the legal opinion justifying U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats in the waters off South America.",
      "The ex-officials sent a request Tuesday to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility calling for an \"immediate investigation into whether members of the [Justice Department's] Office of Legal Counsel violated their professional legal responsibilities in preparing legal guidance that justified the unilateral use of lethal force against civilian foreign nationals, including alleged drug smugglers.\"",
      "The group includes Norm Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter, who served as ethics counsels for Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Their letter cited a Nov. 12 report in the Washington Post, which said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel authored a still-classified opinion finding that \"personnel taking part in military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in Latin America would not be exposed to future prosecution.\"",
      "The group's request for a formal inquiry said: \"The result of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion \u2014 free rein for the government to murder and assassinate foreign civilians \u2014 is shocking and certainly raises the most profound legal ethics concerns.\"",
      "Congressional leaders and top lawmakers on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are expected to receive a briefing from top administration officials on the military strikes and their legal rationale on Tuesday. The military has carried out more than 20 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since the beginning of September, killing more than 80 people.",
      "The Trump administration has consistently defended the military strikes as necessary and lawful, telling Congress in September that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Legal experts have cast doubt on the administration's argument, telling CBS News previously that the claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is flawed because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "In their request for a formal Justice Department internal review, the group of former ethics officials also questioned the administration's determination that the U.S. is in armed conflict with the suspected drug cartels.",
      "\"The U.S. is not in a non-international armed conflict. And even if we were, the murder of civilians would still be a violation of both international and domestic law,\" Eisen, Painter and Canter wrote. \"These flaws call into question whether the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion was prepared independently, objectively and competently.\"",
      "Eisen, who is the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, told CBS News that \"experts have been unequivocal: the legal and factual predicates for these strikes do not withstand basic scrutiny.\"",
      "\"If the administration's foundational premise is wrong, then the use of lethal force has no basis in domestic or international law \u2014 and the OLC memo transgresses ethics boundaries. OPR must investigate,\" he added.",
      "Painter told CBS News that \"the role of OLC is to provide unvarnished legal advice to the president to ensure that the laws are 'faithfully executed' as is required by the Constitution. Unfortunately, all signs point to OLC's opinion being nothing but a legal fig leaf to justify the president's attacks on foreign civilians.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the letter, a Justice Department spokesperson said the strikes \"were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict, and as such are lawful orders.\"",
      "\"Military personnel are legally obligated to follow lawful orders and, as such, are not subject to prosecution for following lawful orders,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have also sought information from the Justice Department about its legal opinions on the military strikes.",
      "In a letter to the agency shared with CBS News, Sen. Peter Welch and Sen. Dick Durbin wrote: \"These recent strikes raise numerous questions about whether the Department provided adequate legal guidance to those involved in ordering, planning, and carrying out the killings. In accordance with the Committee's constitutional oversight responsibilities, we ask that Committee members and staff be briefed on and afforded the opportunity to review any legal analysis produced by your Department.\"",
      "Eisen, Painter and Canter are seeking a review by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, which serves as a version of an internal affairs office for the department. The office's public mission statement said it works \"to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal law enforcement agency.\"",
      "Separately on Tuesday, civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union\u00a0filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York seeking the public release of the OLC memo being used to justify the boat strikes and other documents related to the campaign. The groups said they're suing because the federal government has thus far failed to release the records they requested under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "\"The public deserves to know how the Trump administration is rubber-stamping the bombing of civilians in the Caribbean Sea, with no accountability,\" said Ify Chikezie, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union.",

      "Spokespeople for the White House and Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately comment. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Edgar have had a good working relationship, multiple sources say.",
      "El Salvador has played a high-profile role in the Trump administration's sweeping illegal immigration crackdown. The president in March invoked a 200-year-old wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to send migrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as he sought to deport individuals his administration accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. CBS News previously reported that many of the men do not have criminal convictions.",
      "The men imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a U.S.-brokered swap over the summer. A report by human rights groups last month determined that the deportation and treatment of the more than 200 Venezuelan migrants at the prison amounted to arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "Mr. Trump met in April with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has won the admiration of conservatives in the U.S. for his crackdown on gangs under a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation without due process.",
      "Last month, the administration reached a framework for reciprocal trade agreements with South and Central American countries including El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett on Monday filed paperwork to run for Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in Texas, a source tells CBS News Texas, hours ahead of a planned news conference where she announced her plans.",
      "\"I'm done with going along to get along, and it gets us nowhere,\" Crockett said during her announcement Monday. \"I'm done watching rural hospitals and public schools close their doors. I'm done watching parents be afraid to send their kids to school or the mall or the movies because Republicans have flooded our streets with guns. I'm done with the Senators sitting around doing nothing, while Trump takes your hard-earned money, skims your Social Security, slashes Medicare, and gives tax breaks to billionaires. I'm done. I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring. I'm asking for your support to be the next United States Senator from the great state of Texas.\"",
      "In the Democratic primary, Crockett will face state Rep. James Talarico of Austin, whose campaign has generated national headlines and who raised a record $6.2 million in the first three weeks of his campaign announcement.",
      "After Crockett filed her paperwork, Talarico issued a statement saying, \"We're building a movement in Texas \u2014 fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state. Our movement is rooted in unity over division \u2014 so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\"",
      "Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt are also locked in a closely-watched battle for the GOP nomination. The final general election matchup is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the 2026 national cycle.",
      "Paxton's campaign issued a statement Monday bashing the Dallas Democrat as \"Crazy Crockett,\" but mostly alleging Cornyn has sunken tens of millions of dollars in the race even though \"he's in third place in the primary.\"",
      "Crockett's entry into the race comes after another Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas, dropped out of the race earlier Monday. Instead of filing his paperwork to run in the Senate race, he opted to file to run for the newly-drawn 33rd Congressional District in Dallas County.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the newly-redrawn congressional map could be used in the 2026 election, which included redrawing three Dallas-area districts that are represented by Democrats.",
      "In a statement earlier Monday, Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate. But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33.\"",
      "Before the announcement, some Democrats had expressed disappointment that there could be three major candidates for the U.S. Senate race, instead of spreading out among the other statewide races such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.",
      "In an interview last month, Crockett told CBS News Texas that she would only for U.S. Senate if polling showed she could win a general election, not just the Democratic primary. In the interview, she said she would share her internal polling with Talarico and Allred. \"I'm going to open it up to them because this isn't about me ... It would be really, really, really hard for me now knowing that my district is still at least in its current configuration and knowing that my district absolutely wants me to continue to represent them wholly; it would be really, really hard. But at the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district. It's bigger than the state of Texas. This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "During the interview, the Crockett said she polling for the March 3 primary but instead focusing on the general election next November. Various Democrats have said they believe Paxton will win the Republican primary and because of his political baggage, they think the party has a chance to win a statewide seat for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Crockett said for her to win, she could not count on Republicans crossing over to support her. \"When we ended up with the Trump phenomena or even when we ended up with the Obama phenomenon, they were able to both bring out people that historically did not vote. I think that's the only way that we win in Texas is if we have a candidate that can add to the electorate. If the electorate remains the same electorate that we've had over the last 30 years, then I think we're going to end up with the same result,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Crockett confirmed she spoke with both Talarico and Allred about the Senate race.",
      "Crockett has made national headlines by clashing with President Trump. When asked if she will energize Republicans in addition to Democrats, Matt Angle, Director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told CBS News Texas, \"She could. I think that that's the real challenge is for her to be able to increase turnout for not just her race, but for other Democrats without motivating Republicans. I've been doing politics in Texas a long time. Republicans don't have much to brag about at any level. I'm not sure that being upset with one or two Democrats is going to overcome the fact that they're profoundly disappointed with Republican leadership that's failing them.\"",
      "Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant in North Texas, told CBS News Texas that he agrees with those who believe Crockett cannot win a general election statewide. \"I think she's a real polarizing candidate. She's fun to watch in which she goes crazy on the news. It's always interesting to watch. But I just don't think that's going to work in a general election. I think she is too extreme and too far left for even Texas Democrats,\" Minchillo said. \"I think she'll help turn out Republicans because Republicans are not going to be comfortable with that.\"",
      "Minchillo said he believes the Republican primary is headed for a runoff but doesn't know for sure which two candidates will make advance.",
      "\"We got a long way to go. This has already been a nasty race to begin with. Cornyn came out of the gate saying that he was going to take Paxton to the woodshed and put in words stronger than that. This has been pretty nasty. Cornyn has spent the summer pounding on Paxton. He's moved numbers in his favor. Now, we're seeing a little bit of back and forth. So, this is going to be really rough. The Cornyn folks have actually opened a second front. They're starting to beat on Wesley Hunt. So that's going to be tough. I don't see a path to be honest for Hunt. I just don't think he can beat either Cornyn or Paxton. Maybe a better chance to beat Cornyn, but I just don't think he can get there unless he's got a lot of money,\" Minchillo said",
      "Minchillo predicts that between all of the candidates and their campaigns, plus the third-party groups that support them for both the primary, primary runoff, and general election, tat the Senate race could cost at least $750 million.",
      "With Crockett's decision to run for the Senate, she will leave behind the 30th Congressional District she has represented since 2023. As CBS News Texas reported last week, Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth, will file to run in the newly drawn 30th District, which mostly includes parts of Dallas County and a portion of eastern Tarrant County. Veasey has represented the current 33rd Congressional District, which stretches from his hometown of Fort Worth to Dallas, since 2013.",
      "Frederick Haynes, III, senior pastor at the Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas, has also explored running for the 30th Congressional District and confirmed he was aware of an effort to draft him to run.",
      "The newly drawn 33rd Congressional District is now entirely within Dallas County and a majority Latino district. Allred will face Democratic Rep.Julie Johnson of Farmers Branch, who succeeded Allred in the 32nd Congressional District after he ran for U.S. Senate last year against Republican Senator Ted Cruz.",
      "The newly drawn 32nd Congressional District moves from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority. Republican candidates include Ryan Binkley, Darrell Day, Aimee Carrasco, Monty Montanez and Paul Bondar.",
      "Longtime Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California briefly considered running in this North Texas district but changed his mind after meeting with Mr. Trump. He will run for reelection in his San Diego-area district, which was redrawn by Democrats in California to neutralize Texas' redistricting. State Rep. Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, also considered running for this seat, but has announced she is running for re-election in her Texas House district.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with the legality of federal limits on the amount of money a political committee can spend in coordination with a federal candidate, hearing a case that could join a line of recent fights that have led the high court to dismantle campaign finance restrictions.",
      "The dispute, known as NRSC v. FEC, involves caps imposed by Congress on what are called coordinated party expenditures through the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which was passed to regulate the financing of federal campaigns.",
      "For the 2023 to 2024 election cycle, party committees could spend between $61,800 to $123,000 for House seats and between $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate seats, according to the FEC. Congress amended the law in 2014 to allow unlimited coordinated spending on certain activities, such as election-recount lawsuits and other legal proceedings.",
      "The legal battle before the high court was brought in 2022 by then-Senate candidate JD Vance, then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio and two GOP committees, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "The Republicans sued the FEC and argued that the coordinated spending limits violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. A federal appeals court upheld the caps, citing a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that had left them in place.",
      "The Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court. The FEC under President Trump agrees that the spending limits burden the rights of political parties and candidates\u00a0 and should be struck down. The high court appointed a lawyer, Roman Martinez, to argue in defense of the restrictions, and allowed a trio of Democratic Party committees to intervene.",
      "Oral arguments",
      "Over the course of the arguments on Tuesday, three of the court's conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, appeared likely to strike down the spending caps as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "Kavanaugh repeatedly expressed concern about the power of political parties and whether they have been weakened relative to outside groups like super PACs because of campaign finance laws and the Supreme Court's decisions. That weakening has \"negative effects on our constitutional democracy,\" he said.",
      "\"The parties have been weakened overall, and this case is at least \u2026 starts to restore the strength of parties, although obviously it doesn't get them all the way there in competing with outside groups,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch did not ask any questions, and Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probed lawyers only sparingly.",
      "In one early exchange, Roberts pressed Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of the Republicans, on whether there is a distinction between spending by parties and candidates, and contributions to their campaigns. He called it a \"fiction\" that coordinated expenditures are not direct contributions to candidates, which are subject to limitations under federal law.",
      "The three liberal justices, meanwhile, warned that lifting these restrictions could open the door to corruption and allow donors to funnel bribes to candidates through the political party committees in circumvention of limits on direct contributions.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor took aim at the Supreme Court's string of recent rulings that have rolled back campaign finance laws, beginning with its 2010 ruling in the case Citizens United v. FEC, which struck down prohibitions on political spending by corporations.",
      "\"Every time we interfere with the congressional design, we make matters worse,\" she said, adding that the court's \"tinkering causes more harm than good.\"",
      "\"Once we take off this coordinated expenditure limit, then what's left?\" she asked Francisco. \"What's left is nothing, no control whatsoever.\"",
      "But Sarah Harris, the principal deputy solicitor general, rejected the suggestion that Congress imposed the caps solely to prevent corruption in the campaign-finance system.",
      "\"We think the design of that scheme completely refutes any quid pro quo interest and reveals \u2026 that the real interest is in trying to have Congress and its incumbents prescribe how much money is appropriate in particular contexts, how much money should be spent in particular election contexts,\" Harris said.",
      "Martinez, the court-appointed lawyer defending the restrictions, said that the Republicans and the Trump administration are asking the Supreme Court to overturn 50 years of campaign finance law and said the justices should dismiss the case on the grounds that it is moot. The FEC doesn't believe the coordinated spending caps are constitutional, and an executive order from Mr. Trump effectively bars it from enforcing the rules, he said.",
      "\"No one thinks President Trump is going to enforce this law and target his own vice president,\" he told the Supreme Court.",
      "Martinez also noted that Vance is not a candidate for federal office and has declined to definitively say whether he will run for president in 2028, so he is not harmed by the limits.",
      "Alito, however, wasn't convinced.",
      "\"Isn't that what [all] potential candidates always say until the day when they make the announcement?\" he said.",
      "Martinez also warned that while the Republicans are asking only to strike down the limits on coordinated party spending, it's likely they will be back before the Supreme Court urging it to dismantle a host of other campaign finance rules, like restrictions on how much donors can give to parties.",
      "\"You're going to be deluged with petitions, the dominos are going to fall and you're going to have to reconstruct campaign finance law from the ground up,\" he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is likely to issue a decision by the end of June or early day, just months before the 2026 midterm elections.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday that Republicans intend to put up a GOP-led health care bill for a vote alongside Democrats' proposal to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits later this week.",
      "\"This program desperately needs to be reformed, the Democrats have decided, 'We're not going to do anything to reform it,' and so we'll see where the votes are on Thursday,\" Thune said at a news conference following a lunch meeting of Republican senators on Tuesday. \"But we will have an alternative that we will put up that reflects the views of the Republicans here in the United States Senate.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, outlined that the Senate will vote on a measure unveiled earlier this week by GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho.",
      "The legislation, named the Health Care Freedom for Patients Act, doesn't extend the enhanced tax credits. Instead, it would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges.",
      "\"It actually does make health insurance premiums more affordable,\" Thune said. \"It delivers the benefit directly to the patient, not to the insurance company, and it does it in a way that actually saves money to the taxpayer. That is a win-win proposal.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking shortly after Thune, called the Cassidy-Crapo bill \"junk insurance.\"",
      "Thune's announcement comes as Democrats plan to bring up a three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for a vote on Thursday. Democrats have the option to put forward a bill of their choosing as part of the agreement that ended the government shutdown.",
      "The enhanced premium tax credit helped around 22 million low- and middle-income Americans purchase health insurance in 2025. Premium costs are expected to\u00a0increase\u00a0by an average of more than $1,000 annually when they expire in January, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And KFF\u00a0estimated\u00a0that the expiration of the tax credits would more than double annual premiums, from $888 on average in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.",
      "The planned Democratic measure in the Senate is highly unlikely to pick up support from enough Republicans to advance, although Democrats hope it will force GOP members to take a politically unpopular vote against extending the subsidies. A side-by-side vote on a GOP proposal would likely alleviate some pressure on Republicans, though some have advocated against the exercise, since it wouldn't likely produce a solution.",
      "Senate Republicans have been considering their path forward for weeks, and a number of other GOP lawmakers have unveiled their own plans in recent days. Some of those proposals would extend the tax credits with new limits, including a plan from Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Susan Collins of Maine that would extend them by two years. Another plan from Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas would extend the credits by one year before redirecting funds into HSA-style accounts in 2027.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, the GOP-led bill is not expected to pick up enough support to reach the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate. The Democratic bill is also expected to fall short.",
      "Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that Republicans don't see the Democratic bill \"as a law-making exercise.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly don't, which is why they're putting up what is a show vote \u2014 it's a messaging bill,\" Thune said. \"And then we'll see after that whether or not they are serious about doing something, and if there are at least enough of them to find a path forward. We'll see.\"",
      "Thune said Democrats' plan is designed \"to make a political point.\"",
      "\"At some point if they want to make a law, I think we've got people on our side who are interested in doing that,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department can release investigative materials from a sex trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime confidant of Jeffrey Epstein, a federal judge ruled.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday granted the Justice Department's request to unseal a \"voluminous\" set of grand jury transcripts and evidence from a sex trafficking case in New York against Ghislaine Maxwell, a co-conspirator and friend of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer granted the request after the Justice Department renewed its efforts for the material to be made public after Congress passed and President Trump signed a law that requires the department to disclose records related to past investigations into Epstein.",
      "The passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Engelmayer said, \"unambiguously applies\" to not just the grand jury transcripts and evidence against Maxwell, but to \"voluminous discovery\" including unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the Justice Department's possession.",
      "The law requires the Justice Department to provide Epstein- and Maxwell-related records to the public by Dec. 19.",
      "Maxwell's legal team said in a one-page letter to Engelmayer that she did not take a position on the Justice Department's motion. Maxwell was convicted of federal sex trafficking charges in 2021 and is currently serving a federal prison sentence that is set to run through 2037. Her legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.",
      "In November, the Justice Department asked judges in Florida and New York to unseal material in the sex trafficking cases of Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Last week, a federal judge\u00a0granted the Justice Department's request in Florida to unseal grand jury transcripts from federal investigations into Epstein from 2005 and 2007.",
      "In July, the Justice Department moved to unseal grand jury materials in the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, but those initial bids were denied, because federal rules required grand jury proceedings and evidence to be kept secret.",
      "However, after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department argued that the law should override grand jury secrecy rules.",
      "Engelmayer's order requires the identities of Epstein and Maxwell's victims to be redacted to protect them, he wrote, citing ongoing concerns from the victims and their families, and lack of consultation with the victims by the Justice Department during this process.",
      "\"The victims' concerns, regrettably, have a basis in fact.\u00a0 In its two rounds of applications to this Court to disclose records, DOJ, although paying lip service to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims, has not treated them with the solicitude they deserve,\" Engelmayer wrote.",
      "Engelmayer said he has \"put in place a mechanism to protect victims from the inadvertent release of materials within the discovery in this case that would identify them or otherwise invade their privacy,\" and will require the U.S. attorney to \"personally certify\" that material is properly reviewed before it is released to protect victims' identities.",

    "summary": "\"I won't feel like we're out of the wilderness until we win in '28,\" DNC Chairman Ken Martin told CBS News in the first in a series of interviews with both major parties' leaders ahead of next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "In the year since President Trump and the GOP's decisive 2024 victories, Democrats have been grappling with a central question: how to chart a path out of what many in the party have described as the political \"wilderness.\"",
      "A series of wins in 2025 \u2014 from New York City to California, New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 has eased some of that anxiety. While Democrats' over-performance in these races came largely in blue states, party operatives say the victories have offered needed momentum and a sense of direction after last year's bruising losses at the hands of Republicans left many Democrats feeling adrift.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said he believes the party's rebuilding process remains far from complete, but that it has taken steps to correct the direction.",
      "\"I won't feel like we're out of the wilderness until we win in '28,\" Martin said. \"Our motto at the DNC is all gas, no breaks. We're not gonna rest until November of 2028 and we've got a lot of work to do between now and then.\"",
      "But Martin said he feels \"buoyed\" by the off-year wins, including at the local level. Democrats won governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia by double-digit margins last month, after losing ground to Mr. Trump in both states in 2024. And a Democrat lost a special election for a House seat in middle Tennessee last week by 9 points, well below the GOP's 21-point edge last year.",
      "\"As we go into 2026, certainly, I wouldn't trade our place with the Republicans in a million years,\" he said, \"because we've got wind at our back.\"",
      "With the midterm elections less than a year away, Martin argued that Mr. Trump's policies have created political vulnerabilities for Republicans. He pointed to recent polls that show that some groups who shifted toward Mr. Trump last year, including young voters, Latinos and independents, are souring on his economic message.",
      "\"His tariffs are wreaking devastation throughout this country,\" Martin said. \"People's lives have gotten much worse than they were a year ago. He's going into the election with the lowest approval rating for any president in the history of this country.\"",
      "When asked about Democrats' prospects in the 2026 midterms and if it could be a \"wave\" election year, as some Democrats have predicted, Martin said the possibility exists \u2014 but insisted the party cannot just rely on national headwinds and 2025 gains, which were won primarily on friendly blue turf.",
      "\"Could it be a wave election? Sure, but we're not going to rest on that,\" he said. \"If we do our job and we take advantage of the opportunity, we will win again. I'm confident we're going to win again. I'm not complacent.\"",
      "Democratic leaders have expressed to CBS News that they hope the party's recent run of victories signals a broader political opening. But, Martin emphasized, they believe their path back to national power will require sustained yet simple message discipline heading into next year's midterms, including on the issue that has defined this year's cycle: affordability.",
      "Martin cited candidates' focus on affordability and kitchen table issues in 2025 as crucial to Democratic wins and said that same focus will be essential for success in the midterms and beyond.",
      "\"If all we're doing is resisting Donald Trump, then the one thing we're not doing is giving the American people a sense of what the Democratic Party stands for, who we're fighting for and why,\" Martin said. \"The reason why those people who voted for Donald Trump have now voted for us is because we're talking about the issues that they're concerned about.\"",
      "History could be on Democrats' side next year. Midterm elections almost always favor the party that doesn't control the White House, and Democrats hope that Mr. Trump's approval ratings could give them a boost. Republicans control the House by a razor-thin seven votes, so the lower chamber could shift to Democratic control if only a small handful of seats change hands in 2026.",
      "Flipping the Senate, which the GOP controls by a 53-47 margin, could prove a more challenging task next year, with only a handful of plausible opportunities for Democrats to win GOP-held seats.",
      "And there remain disagreements within the party over whether Democrats are better off embracing a progressive platform or choosing a more centrist tack. This year's races haven't delivered a clear verdict on that score. Moderate candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill won the gubernatorial races last month in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively, but on the same night, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.",
      "Martin was asked about progressive firebrand Rep. Jasmine Crockett's entrance Monday into next year's high-stakes Senate race in Texas, and whether he is concerned she might be more viable in a Democratic primary than in a general election.",
      "Crockett has built up a national following in recent years, powered by her frequent cable news appearances, viral arguments with Republicans during committee hearings and clashes with Mr. Trump. She's also known as a prodigious fundraiser.",
      "During a rally Monday to launch her Senate bid, Crockett cast herself as a fighter who could boost voter turnout, and emphasized that she wouldn't have entered the race if she didn't think she was the strongest candidate.",
      "Recent public polling has shown has shown Crockett and her top primary opponent, Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, losing to all three of the main Republican contenders in a hypothetical Senate matchup, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and incumbent Sen. John Cornyn.",
      "\"Everyone knows Crockett will be soundly defeated,\" Paxton said in a statement.",
      "Republican political committees were also quick to pounce with senior Republican officials telling CBS their party was eager to face her in a general election if she were to win the nomination.",
      "\"Jasmine Crockett leading her primary is the latest sign that the Democrat Party is being run by radical leftists,\" The National Republican Senatorial Committee's communications director Joanna Rodriguez said, adding that Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, whom they are backing, is \"the only conservative who will keep Texas red.\"",
      "\"Crockett is electoral kryptonite and now vulnerable Texas Democrats are stuck sharing a ticket with her,\" Reilly Richardson, spokesman for The National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans' political arm, also told CBS News.",
      "Some national Democrats expressed doubt that she would pull off a primary win.",
      "\"I don't know if she wins the primary,\" one top Democrat strategist, who advises congressional campaigns, told CBS News. \"But she could catch fire \u2026 The moment [Democrats] are in is for righteous anger, so that to me is the X factor here in terms of her ability to tap into that.\"",
      "Martin was firm that it is up to Democratic voters to determine the nominee, and that the DNC's responsibility is to respect those results and back the candidate they choose.",
      "\"I've always viewed our role as not to put our thumb on the scale,\" he said. \"The role of the Democratic Party is to respect Democratic primary voters \u2026 the people who show up and say, 'This is who we want to represent us on the ballot in the fall election.'\"",
      "Martin said once voters decide on a nominee, the national party's responsibility is \"to fight like hell for whoever that nominee is, including candidates we might not agree with all the time\" \u2014 even if primaries get \"messy,\" he added, which is likely in the Lone Star electoral matchup.",
      "Republicans are expressing confidence in their own approach. NRCC Spokesperson Mike Marinella argued in a statement that Democrats are \"splintered.\"",
      "Marinella continued: \"their messy primaries are a socialist free-for-all, and voters are constantly reminded that the Democrat Party is on the wrong side of every single issue.\"",
      "When asked whether the DNC can realistically compete with the massive $1 billion war chest Mr. Trump's political operation, GOP and aligned super PACs have amassed ahead of the midterms, Martin pointed to the DNC's recent financial strategy as evidence that the party is not shying away from the challenge.",
      "\"I never measure our fundraising to the other side, and this is critical because at the end of the day, we need the resources to compete,\" he said. \"We need the resources to make deep investments, \u2026 which we have this year. We need the resources to not only build the type of infrastructure around the country, but to do it in a way that's sustainable and again allows us to win. And you know, if we weren't winning as a result, I would be concerned.\"",
      "Martin also spoke about the $20 million\u00a0loan\u00a0the DNC took out earlier this year, prior to the November elections. He said this loan helped the party win key races and set the party up well for fundraising for the upcoming cycles. He said the party has raised over $95 million this year.",
      "\"I made a big bet this year, and that was that we were going to take out a loan so we can invest heavily in these elections a month ago, and we won big,\" Martin said. \"We feel really good about where we're at, and nothing's slowed us down in the sense that we can't do the work that we need to.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, criticized House GOP leaders in an op-ed for what she called their \"restrictive and ineffective\" control of the chamber.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, criticized House GOP leaders in an op-ed on Monday for what she called their \"restrictive and ineffective\" control of the chamber that has yielded few results.",
      "\"Here's a hard truth Republicans don't want to hear: Nancy Pelosi was a more effective House speaker than any Republican this century,\" Mace wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, with the headline \"What's the Point of Congress?\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican said although she agrees with Pelosi on \"essentially nothing,\" the long-time speaker \"understood something we don't: No majority is permanent.\"",
      "Mace, 48, first came to Congress in 2021, making a name for herself as GOP firebrand. She made headlines earlier this year for leading a GOP effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol after the first transgender person was elected to Congress, and she's regularly sparred with witnesses while serving on the House Oversight Committee. More recently, she was among a handful of House Republicans to initially support a petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files. Mace announced in August that she's running for governor of South Carolina.",
      "Mace said that when she came to Congress, she believed she could \"make a difference for my constituents, for South Carolina and for a country I love deeply.\" But she said she's since learned \"that the system in the House promotes control by party leaders over accountability and achievement.\"",
      "\"No one can be held responsible for inaction, so far too little gets done,\" Mace said. \"The obstacles to achieving almost anything are enough to make any member who came to Washington with noble intentions ask: Why am I even here?\"",
      "Mace said if Republicans, with governing control of Washington, fail to \"pass legislation that permanently secures the border, addresses the affordability crisis, improves health care and restores law and order, we will lose this majority.\"",
      "\"And we will deserve it,\" she added.",
      "The South Carolina Republican hasn't shied away from rebuking her party in the past. In 2021, she criticized President Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, suggesting he didn't have a future in the party, before ultimately backing his 2024 presidential bid. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, she urged her GOP colleagues not to go too far on restricting abortion. And in 2023, Mace was among a group of eight Republicans who voted to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.",
      "Mace said in her op-ed that Speaker Mike Johnson \"is better than his predecessor. But the frustrations of being a rank-and-file House member are compounded as certain individuals or groups remain marginalized within the party, getting little say.\"",
      "\"Women will never be taken seriously until leadership decides to take us seriously, and I'm no longer holding my breath,\" she added.",
      "Mace's comments come amid criticism from other House Republican women. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, expressed frustration with Johnson last week as she sparred with the speaker over a provision within the annual defense policy bill. And last month, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced that she will resign from Congress in the new year, expressing frustration with her party while pointing to her dramatic break with Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "The new financial aid package is expected to shore up the U.S. agricultural sector, which has been hurt by tariffs and a trade war with China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced a $12 billion aid package for American farmers, moving to support a sector that's been hurt by tariffs and a U.S. trade war with China.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the plan during a White House event attended by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, several lawmakers and members of the farming community.",
      "Mr. Trump said the money to fund the aid package would come from government revenue raised through U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops, and it'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,\" he said in announcing the financial assistance.",
      "Rollins said farmers can apply for the funding in the coming weeks and that it will be disbursed by Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Trade war hit",
      "Roughly $11 billion of the government assistance is set aside for the Department of Agriculture's Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which the White House has said will offer one-time payments to farmers for row crops.",
      "\"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good,\" Bessent\u00a0told \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday.",
      "Rep. Glenn \"GT\" Thompson, the chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, commended the aid package.",
      "\"The critical assistance announced today will help farmers obtain financing for 2026 and serve as a bridge to the long-term improvements to the farm safety net, which were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said in a statement.",
      "American farmers have already lost billions of dollars in soybean sales this year after China halted purchases in May in retaliation for the Trump administration's tariffs. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall estimates farmers' total losses will reach $34 billion amid broader economic headwinds.",
      "\"[Farmers] face the same high prices as all of America's families, as more of their income is going to household bills and higher operating costs, including loans, equipment and supplies,\" he said in a statement. \"At the same time, farmers are receiving historically low prices for most major crops.\"",
      "China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing more than half of all American exports of the crop in the last five years, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau, a farmer advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a preliminary\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0in October, which the White House said involved the resumption of U.S. soybean sales to China. The White House said\u00a0in November that China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans in the last two months of 2025.",
      "However, Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans could fall short of what the country normally purchases, CBS News correspondent Lana Zak\u00a0reported in November.",
      "The trade war with China dealt a double whammy to U.S farmers, who were already facing high input costs and weak profit margins. Farmers recently\u00a0told 60 Minutes\u00a0they are suffering major losses on corn, soybeans and cotton. Prices of the crops have fallen in the last two years, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation, an advocacy organization.",
      "Bessent said on Face the Nation on Sunday that domestic soybean prices have risen as much as 15% since the agreement with the Chinese.",
      "The Trump administration started considering\u00a0a financial aid package for farmers\u00a0in October, with sources telling CBS News that it could include more than $10 billion in relief. However, that proposal was put on hold due to the 43-day U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, which ended in mid-November.",

    "summary": "National Democrats have deployed resources for County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, while Mr. Trump has endorsed former City Manager Emilio Gonzalez.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Democrat Eileen Higgins won the mayoral runoff election with about 59% of the vote.",
      "It's been more than 30 years since Miami last elected a Democrat to serve as mayor, but the party feels this might be its best shot to reclaim victory in decades, as its candidate said a win would be a referendum on President Trump's immigration policy.",
      "\"What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they're not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they're also sinful,\" Eileen Higgins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said.",
      "Higgins, a county commissioner, is facing a runoff election against Republican hopeful Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, Miami-Dade County commissioner and director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush.",
      "\"My opponent would like this to be a referendum on the president,\" said Gonzalez, who has been endorsed by Mr. Trump. \"I want our voters to make this a referendum on me.\"",
      "While the race is technically a nonpartisan election, national Democrats have deployed resources for Higgins, including an endorsement video by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a visit from Arizona's Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego and a canvassing event with former Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel.",
      "Higgins came in first in the Nov. 4 election with 36% of the vote, followed by Gonzalez's 19% \u2014 but since neither candidate reached 50% in a 13-person field, a runoff election between the top two candidates is set for Tuesday. Adding to the Democratic Party's optimism is early voting data, which shows Democrats outpacing Republicans by about 8%.",
      "Florida Republicans have sought to downplay the significance of Tuesday's election. The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.",
      "Yet a win for Democrats in Florida, Mr. Trump's adopted home state, and in the city that is set to become the site for his presidential library, would be a reversal in fortune for Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump handily won the state in 2024 by more than 13%. Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years. Statewide, Republicans have a 10-point registration lead over Democrats.",
      "\"She's certainly running a lot of high-energy efforts on the ground there, bringing in a big coalition, bringing in all types of folks to support her. I certainly think she has a great shot,\" said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee Chair. \"Will be a big, big win if we win that.\"",
      "The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump again weighed in on the race Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social: \"Miami's Mayor Race is Tuesday. It is a big and important race!!! Vote for Republican Gonzalez. He is FANTASTIC! You can also vote today. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The city of Miami has a population that is 57% foreign-born, according to the 2024 U.S. Census, and about half are naturalized U.S. Citizens who would be eligible to vote in the election. While Hispanic voters nationally trend toward the Democratic Party, in South Florida, Republicans have found a stronghold among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan exiles who fled communist and socialist governments.",
      "However, Mr. Trump's immigration policy has come to something of a flashpoint in Florida. In addition to state troopers carrying out increased immigration enforcement, the Sunshine State is also home to the controversial \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center. The recent end of Temporary Protected Status for over 250,000 Venezuelans could also have considerable repercussions in a state with a large population of immigrants from the South American country, many of whom have been living in the U.S. for years and are deeply integrated in the local economy.",
      "\"It is ruining our economy,\" said Higgins. \"Sure, get the criminals out of here, but find a path to citizenship for people who deserve it and for an economy that needs it.\"",
      "Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.",
      "\"They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,\" he said. \"Why pick a fight about national immigration policy? Next, we are going to be talking about whether men should be in women's sports.\"",
      "Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground if she is elected, but warned, \"When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.\"",

      "The deal does not include Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell system or its soon-to-be-released Rubin system, Mr. Trump said.",

    "summary": "Two companies dominate U.S. dialysis services, and a CBS News review of federal data found one-third of dialysis clinics failed to meet federal standards this year.",
    "story": [
      "A leading U.S. senator is calling on federal regulators to share the results of an investigation into the dialysis industry, where critics say a \"duopoly\" has compromised the quality of critical, lifesaving kidney care.",
      "Two companies now own nearly 75% of all U.S. dialysis clinics \u2014 nearly 5,600 in total, a CBS News investigation reported earlier this year. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in an interview with CBS News he is troubled by the \"hallmarks of unlawful abuse of market power.\"",
      "\"The government may feel it has no leverage against two companies that provide for almost all the dialysis treatment in the country,\" Blumenthal said in an interview with CBS News. \"But it has failed to use more leverage, including its antitrust powers against those companies.\"",
      "The FTC, which polices the business world for anti-competitive conduct, had been probing whether the two companies' lock on the market impacted patient care, Blumenthal said, but any findings have not been made public. Blumenthal said he has requested the agency \"take appropriate robust enforcement action to remediate issues it has identified and protect patients, including veterans, from misconduct by these companies.\"",
      "Roughly 500,000 Americans depend on dialysis to stay alive as they wait and hope for a kidney transplant. The centers, where patients come to have their blood filtered offer\u00a0 the only available remedy for most suffering from end-stage kidney disease. Critics of the industry allege the leading companies that provide that care, Fresenius and DaVita, have become too focused on profits.",
      "\"This is emergency room care done in the mall,\" said Tom Mueller, the author of \"How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine,\" who spent more than five years studying the dialysis industry. \"People are not given the tailored treatment that they need.\"",
      "The companies have for three decades been creeping towards \"a duopoly,\" according to Ryan McDevitt, a Duke University economist who spoke to CBS News earlier this year about the issue.",
      "\"This is the most concentrated health care sector across the entire U.S.,\" McDevitt said.",
      "The CBS News review of federal data found one-third of dialysis clinics failed to meet federal standards this year \u2014 nearly 2,500 of the roughly 7,600 clinics nationwide. The average score was 60 out of 100 possible points.",
      "In separate statements to CBS News, both companies highlighted their performance, saying the data reflects a track record of \"exemplary care.\"",
      "McDevitt argued that Medicare's limits on how much it reimburses clinics per patient have incentivized DaVita and Fresenius to focus on filling chairs to increase their profit margins. Both companies reject that characterization.",
      "Last year alone, DaVita delivered more than 29 million dialysis treatments, earning $391 in revenue per session, and Davita and Fresenius reported a total of $33.7 billion in revenue.",
      "McDevitt said his research found that over the last twenty years, when independent clinics are acquired by DaVita or Fresenius, their transplant referrals drop by about 10%, their patient survival rates fall by 2%, hospitalizations increase by 5%, and infection rates go up by about 12%.",
      "Criticism of the industry has been disputed by the two for-profit companies. Fresenius told CBS News in a statement this summer that the company maintains an \"unwavering focus on improving quality of life, strengthening clinical outcomes, and extending the lifespan of those we have the privilege to serve.\" DaVita said in a statement that its \"dedicated clinicians consistently deliver high-quality, individualized care in a complex clinical and regulatory environment.\"",
      "For years, health surveyors from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have conducted routine monitoring of dialysis clinics to assess their performance.",
      "Since 2013, those officials have cited U.S. dialysis centers for more than 115,000 deficiencies, including poor hand hygiene, unsanitary conditions while handling IV medications, and inadequate training.",
      "Fresenius noted that more than 65% of its dialysis centers received three stars or higher on Medicare's five-star scale \u2014 a rate the company said is higher than the national average of all U.S. dialysis providers. The company also said its employees \"take immense pride in providing best-in-class, high-quality care to our patients.\"",
      "DaVita said in a statement to CBS News that problems in clinics were \"rare and isolated\" and represent \"exceptions and do not reflect the exemplary care we consistently provide.\"",
      "\"We take every concern seriously, and if we make an error, we work immediately to resolve it,\" DaVita said in its statement. \"To mischaracterize such anomalies as systemic care failures is reckless, fear-mongering, and puts patient well-being at risk.\"",
      "Blumenthal noted that one group that has seen greater reliance on the for-profit clinics are those who served in the American military. Some 40,000 veterans depend on dialysis to stay alive as they wait and hope for a kidney transplant, the only available remedy for those suffering from end-stage kidney disease.",
      "In his letter to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Blumenthal called on the agency to \"take appropriate robust enforcement action to remediate issues it has identified and protect patients, including veterans, from misconduct by these companies.\"",
      "\"This industry is ripe with predatory, monopolistic potential practices,\" Blumenthal alleged in the letter, adding that the \"anti-competitive anti consumer situation, and it cries out for the kind of investigation that the FTC would do.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Fresenius said, \"We are aware of the inquiry and are fully cooperating with the FTC. As this is an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment any further.\"",

    "summary": "Ex-FBI agents are trying to get their jobs back, claiming they were fired during Trump's second term for their efforts in 2020 to head off a riot in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.",
    "story": [
      "In a federal civil lawsuit filed in Washington Monday, a dozen former FBI agents are seeking to get their jobs back, claiming they were fired during the second Trump administration for their efforts in 2020 to head off a riot in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.",
      "The former agents say they were unlawfully terminated by the Justice Department earlier this year for kneeling in 2020, as tensions were rising on the streets of Washington, D.C., soon after Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.",
      "They allege FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and the Justice Department terminated them based on a perception of the agents that they were \"not affiliated with President Trump.\"",
      "The lawsuit recounts the actions the former agents say they took on June 4, 2020, just over a week after Floyd was killed. That day, as they were patrolling the district, the agents \"were confronted by a mob that included hostile individuals alongside families with young children,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "\"The Special Agents closest to the mob were the first to kneel,\" the plaintiffs' suit said. \"Their intent was to prevent a dangerous situation in which confrontational or unwitting civilians might make physical contact with agents or even attempt to gain control.\"",
      "And the former agents also contend that they had not been issued \"sufficient equipment for responding to civil unrest such as riot shields, gas masks, helmets, or other tactical gear.\"",
      "The former agents are not publicly named in the lawsuit and are referred to as Jane and John Does.",
      "\"Plaintiffs had been informed that the purpose of the deployment was to show a visible law enforcement presence, and they wore vests marked 'FBI' and carried their firearms,\" the lawsuit said. \"But they were not properly prepared or instructed to conduct crowd control operations.\" It continued, \"As a result of their tactical decision to kneel, the mass of people moved on without escalating to violence.\"",
      "Mary Dohrmann, an attorney representing the agents in the lawsuit, told CBS News, \"Internal FBI processes are being subverted in a way that makes us all less safe.\"",
      "An FBI spokesperson told CBS News the bureau does not comment on pending litigation, and the FBI did not comment when CBS News reported in September that agents had been fired for kneeling in 2020.",
      "The civil case is filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The fired FBI agents include counterterrorism specialists and agents with more than 15 years' experience in combating criminals.",
      "According to the lawsuit, \"Plaintiff Jane Doe 5 was informed that she was being removed at the direction of Defendant Patel from her position at FBI Headquarters as a Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI overseeing counterintelligence at the direction of Defendant Patel because she kneeled on June 4, 2020.\"",
      "Their civil case argues that Patel's statements show \"his actions in this case were motivated by partisan animus toward plaintiffs and not by a fair evaluation of the facts on June 4, 2020.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments over the president's authority to remove members of many independent agencies that Congress has sought to insulate from political pressure, with a majority of the justices appearing open to overturning a 90-year-old decision that shields some officials from removal without cause.",
      "The case, Trump v. Slaughter, arose from President Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling known as Humphrey's Executor upheld limits established by Congress that enabled the president to remove members of commissions like the FTC only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "The Trump administration argues those limits violate the separation of powers. The FTC wields executive power, so the president should have the authority to fire its members for any reason, it says. Slaughter's attorneys argue the removal protections fall within Congress' power to determine the structure of the government, and say the administration's position would allow the president to upend many other longstanding independent agencies and commissions that have been established by Congress.",
      "During oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, the three liberal justices defended the removal protections and warned that a decision in Mr. Trump's favor could cause chaos across the government. The court's conservatives, meanwhile, expressed skepticism with the argument that Congress could limit the president's ability to remove officials from the FTC and other independent agencies, opening the door to a ruling in the administration's favor.",
      "Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer presented the case for the administration. He urged the justices to overturn the decision in Humphrey's Executor, saying it encroaches on the president's removal authority under Article II of the Constitution.",
      "\"Humphrey's must be overruled. It has become a decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions. It was grievously wrong when it was decided,\" Sauer said. \"It continues to generate confusion in the lower courts, and it continues to tempt Congress to erect, at the heart of our government, a headless fourth branch, insulated from political accountability and democratic control.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, were skeptical of Sauer's argument.",
      "\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,\" Sotomayor said.",
      "She warned that a decision invalidating removal limits for members of the FTC could also put at risk the independence of other federal entities, such as the U.S. Tax Court and broader protections for the civil service. Slaughter's lawyers have warned that a ruling expanding presidential power over multi-member agencies could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, though the Supreme Court has indicated that it views the central bank differently.",
      "Kagan zeroed in on the impacts of a decision overturning Humphrey's Executor, raising the prospect that a ruling striking down the precedent could be used to target protections for officials across the government: \"The question is, where does this lead? Where does it take you to, given what your primary rationale is? Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century \u2026 Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way.\"",
      "She noted that independent agencies also wield legislative and judicial powers and warned that expanding the president's control over them would put \"massive uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president\" and leave the nation with a leader who then has \"control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking in this country.\"",
      "Jackson said that Sauer is \"asking us to infer\" that the removal protections are unconstitutional based on the structure of the Constitution, \"and I don't know why we'd make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.\"",
      "The court's conservatives were more receptive to the Trump administration's arguments.",
      "\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that \"a lot of legislative power has moved into these agencies,\" but said that \"if they're now going to be controlled by the president, it seems to me all the more imperative to do something about it.\"",
      "Attorney Amit Agarwal presented Slaughter's case, and argued that the removal protections have a long tradition in American history. He said that Congress has a role in limiting how officials on independent commissions like the FTC can be removed.",
      "\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" Agarwal said.",
      "Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas tested the boundaries of Agarwal's position, asking him whether Congress could transform Cabinet-level executive departments into multi-member commissions and limit the president's ability to fire their leaders. Agarwal said the Constitution would largely prohibit such a move, since Congress cannot limit the president's authority over officials who are wielding his \"conclusive and preclusive\" powers, which would apply to most departments.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito was similarly skeptical of Agarwal's argument, saying that \"I don't know that you can make the argument that the logic of [Sauer's] argument is going to cause these allegedly revolutionary results without being prepared to explain more concretely than you have the limits of your own argument.\"",
      "Agarwal added later: \"We have a 111-year-old statute that was enacted by the people's elected representatives. It was signed into law by a president of the United States. It was unanimously affirmed by this court. And it's been followed by every single president since 1935 until the present. We don't need an abstract theory to tell us that the FTC Act is OK. It's the other side that needs to give you a really compelling theory to explain why, in our view, 200-plus years of precedent and history need to be abandoned.\"",
      "Gorsuch continued to probe Agarwal's position, hinting that he thought the line Agarwal was trying to draw to limit the president's power to remove officials was unwieldy: \"How are we supposed to decide which powers are exclusive? \u2026 What powers are going to fall in and what are going to fall out? Are we going to have just as much litigation over that as anything else we might do in this case?\"",
      "The background of Trump v. Slaughter",
      "The case is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of that New Deal-era ruling in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have chipped away at that precedent. Most recently, the high court invalidated removal protections for leaders of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "But the Slaughter case now gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to overturn that 90-year-old precedent entirely.",
      "Since he returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the bounds of presidential power and moved to oust a host of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions, including Slaughter.",
      "Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by former President Joe Biden, Slaughter received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "Slaughter, like many other agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, filed a lawsuit arguing that her firing was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Her lawyers argue that Mr. Trump violated that law and Supreme Court precedent with the firing of Slaughter and a second commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya.",
      "A federal district court sided with Slaughter and ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks later, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated to her role at the FTC once again.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in late September to hear the case and allowed Mr. Trump to fire Slaughter while it considers the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the FTC.",
      "The Trump administration argued in filings that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. Removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, Sauer wrote.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power and said Congress could impose removal restrictions for multimember agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, like the FTC.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that since 1935, the FTC has accumulated executive powers. Today, the commission executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote in his filing.",
      "More than 200 Democrats in Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. They wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that over the past 100 years, 15 different presidents from both parties have signed bills into law that created independent agencies.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has already seen some success at the Supreme Court in his bid to assert more control over these bodies. The high court's conservative majority has allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause while legal challenges to their removals moved forward.",
      "The president has also attempted to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will hear arguments in that case next month.",

    "summary": "Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "story": [
      "A northern Virginia man was arrested and accused of placing two pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal authorities announced Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old from Woodbridge, Virginia, located just outside Washington, D.C. Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.",
      "Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.",
      "Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.",
      "An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.",
      "The court documents don't make any references to the Capitol riot that took place the following day. During Thursday's news conference, Bondi didn't provide details about the suspect's possible motive.",
      "\"Right now, it's ongoing,\" she said. \"Again, we just executed the search warrant early, early this morning. It's ongoing, but America's safer, D.C.'s safer because he's in custody.\"",
      "Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"",
      "\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.",
      "The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years.  The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.",
      "The devices \u2014 made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.",
      "The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.",
      "\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"",
      "Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.",
      "But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect \u2014 grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie \u2014 and offered $500,000 for information.",
      "In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fossil-footprints-bolivia-dinosaurs-awkward-attempt-swim/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",
      "\"Because they're so influential, knowing more about the magnetism of AGNs, and how they whip up winds such as these, is key to understanding the history of galaxies throughout the Universe,\" Diez said.",

    "summary": "Russian Soyuz crews are now spending eight months aboard the space station instead of six to stretch supplies and lower costs.",
    "story": [
      "A NASA astronaut and two cosmonaut crewmates strapped into their Soyuz ferry ship Monday evening, undocked from the International Space Station and plunged to an on-target landing on the frigid steppe of Kazakhstan early Tuesday to wrap up an\u00a0eight-month mission.",
      "With Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov strapped into the descent module's center seat, flanked on his left by cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky and on the right by NASA's Jonny Kim, the Soyuz MS-27/73S spacecraft undocked from the lab at 8:41 p.m. ET.",
      "After moving a safe distance away to a precise point in space, the Soyuz braking rockets fired for four minutes and 42 seconds starting at 11:09 p.m., slowing the ship's 17,100-mph velocity by about 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into Earth's lower atmosphere.",
      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",
      "Left behind aboard the space station were NASA Crew 11 fliers Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 01:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Under Rod Paige's leadership, the Department of Education implemented the No Child Left Behind policy that in 2002 became former President George W. Bush's signature education law.",
    "story": [
      "Rod Paige, an educator, coach and administrator who rolled out the nation's landmark No Child Left Behind law as the first African American to serve as U.S. education secretary, died Tuesday.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, who tapped Paige for the nation's top federal education post, announced the death in a statement but did not provide further details. Paige was 92.",
      "Under Paige's leadership, the Department of Education implemented No Child Left Behind policy that in 2002 became Bush's signature education law and was modeled on Paige's previous work as a schools superintendent in Houston. The law established universal testing standards and sanctioned schools that failed to meet certain benchmarks.",
      "\"Rod was a leader and a friend,\" Bush said in his statement. \"Unsatisfied with the status quo, he challenged what we called 'the soft bigotry of low expectations.' Rod worked hard to make sure that where a child was born didn't determine whether they could succeed in school and beyond.\"",
      "Roderick R. Paige was born to two teachers in the small Mississippi town of Monticello of roughly 1,400 inhabitants. The oldest of five siblings, Paige served a two-year stint the U.S. Navy before becoming a football coach at the high school, and then junior college levels. Within years, Paige rose to head coach of Jackson State University, his alma mater and a historically Black college in the Mississippi capital city.",
      "There, his team became the first \u2014 with a 1967 football game \u2014 to integrate Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, once an all-White venue.",
      "After moving to Houston in the mid-1970s to become head coach of Texas Southern University, Paige pivoted from the playing field to the classroom and education \u2014 first as a teacher, and then as administrator and eventually the dean of its college of education from 1984 to 1994.",
      "Amid growing public recognition of his pursuit of educational excellence, Paige rose to become superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, then one of the largest school districts in the country.",
      "He quickly drew the attention of Texas' most powerful politicians for his sweeping educational reforms in the diverse Texas city. Most notably, he moved to implement stricter metrics for student outcomes, something that became a central point for Bush's 2000s bid for president. Bush \u2014 who later would dub himself the \"Education President\" \u2014 frequently praised Paige on the campaign trail for the Houston reforms he called the \"Texas Miracle.\"",
      "And once Bush won election, he tapped Paige to be the nation's top education official.",
      "As education secretary from 2001 to 2005, Paige emphasized his belief that high expectations were essential for childhood development.",
      "\"The easiest thing to do is assign them a nice little menial task and pat them on the head,\" he told the Washington Post at the time. \"And that is precisely what we don't need. We need to assign high expectations to those people, too. In fact, that may be our greatest gift: expecting them to achieve, and then supporting them in their efforts to achieve.\"",
      "While some educators applauded the law for standardizing expectations regardless of student race or income, others complained for years about what they consider a maze of redundant and unnecessary tests and too much \"teaching to the test\" by educators.",
      "In 2015, House and Senate lawmakers agreed to pull back many provisions from \"No Child Left Behind,\" shrinking the Education Department's role in setting testing standards and preventing the federal agency from sanctioning schools that fail to improve. That year, then-President Barack Obama signed the sweeping education law overhaul, ushering in a new approach to accountability, teacher evaluations and the way the most poorly performing schools are pushed to improve.",
      "After serving as education secretary, Paige returned to Jackson State University a half century after he was a student there, serving as the interim president in 2016 at the age of 83.",
      "Into his 90s, Paige still publicly expressed deep concern, and optimism, about the future of U.S. education. In an opinion piece appearing in the Houston Chronicle in 2024, Paige lifted up the city that helped propel him to national prominence, urging readers to \"look to Houston not just for inspiration, but for hard-won lessons about what works, what doesn't and what it takes to shake up a stagnant system.\"",

    "story": [
      "Six months after stepping down from leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire Elon Musk suggested he likely would not repeat his time helming the controversial cost-cutting mission.",
      "Musk discussed his time at the White House in a nearly hourlong podcast interview with former Trump administration aide Katie Miller that was released Tuesday. Asked if he believes DOGE was successful, Musk responded that it was \"a little bit successful.\"",
      "\"We were somewhat successful,\" the world's richest man said, adding that he believes the initiative \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\" and was \"entirely wasteful.\"",
      "Miller asked Musk if he would repeat his time leading the cost-cutting initiative, knowing what he knows now. He demurred before saying: \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would've basically\u2026worked in my companies, essentially.\"",
      "He continued: \"They wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" referring to a series of arson and vandalism incidents that hit dealerships for Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla.",
      "Named after an internet meme, DOGE was formed\u00a0just hours\u00a0after President Trump was sworn in. Musk, who\u00a0spent hundreds of millions\u00a0supporting Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, quickly became a\u00a0near-ubiquitous presence\u00a0at the White House.",
      "Musk and his young team at DOGE quickly tore through the executive branch, shutting down programs that they found wasteful and pushing for massive reductions to the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and voluntary buyouts. In some cases, entire agencies \u2014 including the U.S. Agency for International Development \u2014 were effectively shuttered.",
      "Musk has suggested the effort could save the government hundreds of billions, and possibly $2 trillion, though some of the cost savings figures touted by DOGE have been called into question.",
      "His aggressive approach \u2014 epitomized by a February event in which he waved around a chainsaw, calling it \"the chainsaw for bureaucracy\" \u2014 had its share of detractors, including federal workers who faced layoffs and disruptions, and Democratic lawmakers who argued the initiative was wielding vast power without approval from Congress. Lawsuits were filed to halt some of the cuts. Musk defended DOGE, arguing the government needs to slash its spending.",
      "Musk and the Mr. Trump's once-close relationship ruptured shortly after the Tesla CEO left the White House in late May. In a public back-and-forth, Musk attacked the president in personal terms and criticized his signature tax legislation, and Mr. Trump threatened to cut off lucrative federal subsidies for Tesla and Musk's rocket company SpaceX.",
      "Musk has also flirted with launching his own political party \u2014 though his plans are unclear.",
      "The two have appeared to at least partially mend their relationship since then, with Musk visiting the White House last month for a dinner with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.",
      "Asked last week if Musk is back in his circle of friends, Mr. Trump said, \"I like Elon a lot,\" before suggesting that their rift was due to cuts to electric vehicle subsidies.",
      "\"I think we get along well,\" the president added.",
      "And Musk, for his part, told Miller in his podcast interview that Mr. Trump is the funniest person he knows.",
      "\"He's got a great sense of humor,\" he said, pointing to the president's\u00a0Oval Office banter\u00a0with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \"It's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"",

      "\"This was not a mass shooting or a random incident,\" the governor said in a video statement.",
      "The wounded person was taken to a local hospital in critical but stable condition, Tracy said.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Cruz, who is from Honduras and has lived in the U.S. for roughly two decades, had spent nearly three weeks avoiding work because of heightened immigration enforcement in the area, Escalante said. The family had even discussed the night before whether she should leave the house for a painting job.",
      "\"'We've all been talking to her as well, that she should probably not go,\" Escalante said, explaining that recent raids had kept everyone inside.",
      "Cruz's arrest came amid an operation dubbed \"Catahoula Crunch,\" a Department of Homeland Security effort that officials say targets \"criminal illegal aliens\" in the New Orleans area. Escalante said he does not know his mother's immigration status, but does not believe she's an American citizen. When asked if his mother had a criminal history, Escalante said he was not aware of any crimes she has committed. He's not sure why ICE agents would target his mother for deportation.",
      "ICE officials did not respond to CBS News' repeated requests for comment. ICE officials did not answer repeated requests for information on Cruz and why she was apprehended.",
      "Now, Escalante said he is the sole caregiver for his 9-year-old sister \u2014 something he never imagined would happen. Unlike their mother, the two siblings are both American citizens, but he still worries about being detained. He said he sometimes carries around his passport, just in case.",
      "\"Because I am afraid of ICE agents just stopping me because they feel like it,\" Escalante said.",
      "That fear isn't unfounded. More than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration agents so far this year, according to a ProPublica report.",
      "Jacelynn Guzman, a U.S. citizen, was chased by ICE agents last week in New Orleans.",
      "\"I immediately started telling him, 'I'm born and raised here. I'm a U.S. citizen.' And he did not care at all,\" Guzman said. \"I didn't know if I should run or not, I was scared, but then another car pulled up and I was like I'm out of here.\"",
      "Agents later said she matched the description of a suspect.",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, a prominent civil rights group, is looking at legal action to stop the detention operations in Louisiana. A LULAC spokesman told CBS News that they have set up a GoFundMe page for the family to help with expenses and bills. The spokesman also added that LULAC officials believe Cruz is being held in a Mississippi detention facility.",
      "As the family waits for news, Escalante described the way his mother sounded on the phone before the line went dead.",
      "\"She just sounded really worried, and her voice wasn't shaky \u2014 I'm pretty sure she was forcing herself, because she probably didn't want me to hear that from her,\" Escalante said, adding, \"We've had bumps here and there, but she would never show me the side of her where she has to worry about bills and all that other stuff.\"",

    "summary": "A bipartisan group of former ethics officials is asking for an internal Justice Department investigation into the legal opinion justifying strikes against alleged drug boats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan group of former federal ethics officials is asking for an internal Justice Department investigation into the legal opinion justifying U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats in the waters off South America.",
      "The ex-officials sent a request Tuesday to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility calling for an \"immediate investigation into whether members of the [Justice Department's] Office of Legal Counsel violated their professional legal responsibilities in preparing legal guidance that justified the unilateral use of lethal force against civilian foreign nationals, including alleged drug smugglers.\"",
      "The group includes Norm Eisen, Richard Painter and Virginia Canter, who served as ethics counsels for Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Their letter cited a Nov. 12 report in the Washington Post, which said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel authored a still-classified opinion finding that \"personnel taking part in military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in Latin America would not be exposed to future prosecution.\"",
      "The group's request for a formal inquiry said: \"The result of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion \u2014 free rein for the government to murder and assassinate foreign civilians \u2014 is shocking and certainly raises the most profound legal ethics concerns.\"",
      "Congressional leaders and top lawmakers on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are expected to receive a briefing from top administration officials on the military strikes and their legal rationale on Tuesday. The military has carried out more than 20 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since the beginning of September, killing more than 80 people.",
      "The Trump administration has consistently defended the military strikes as necessary and lawful, telling Congress in September that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Legal experts have cast doubt on the administration's argument, telling CBS News previously that the claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is flawed because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "In their request for a formal Justice Department internal review, the group of former ethics officials also questioned the administration's determination that the U.S. is in armed conflict with the suspected drug cartels.",
      "\"The U.S. is not in a non-international armed conflict. And even if we were, the murder of civilians would still be a violation of both international and domestic law,\" Eisen, Painter and Canter wrote. \"These flaws call into question whether the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion was prepared independently, objectively and competently.\"",
      "Eisen, who is the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, told CBS News that \"experts have been unequivocal: the legal and factual predicates for these strikes do not withstand basic scrutiny.\"",
      "\"If the administration's foundational premise is wrong, then the use of lethal force has no basis in domestic or international law \u2014 and the OLC memo transgresses ethics boundaries. OPR must investigate,\" he added.",
      "Painter told CBS News that \"the role of OLC is to provide unvarnished legal advice to the president to ensure that the laws are 'faithfully executed' as is required by the Constitution. Unfortunately, all signs point to OLC's opinion being nothing but a legal fig leaf to justify the president's attacks on foreign civilians.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the letter, a Justice Department spokesperson said the strikes \"were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict, and as such are lawful orders.\"",
      "\"Military personnel are legally obligated to follow lawful orders and, as such, are not subject to prosecution for following lawful orders,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have also sought information from the Justice Department about its legal opinions on the military strikes.",
      "In a letter to the agency shared with CBS News, Sen. Peter Welch and Sen. Dick Durbin wrote: \"These recent strikes raise numerous questions about whether the Department provided adequate legal guidance to those involved in ordering, planning, and carrying out the killings. In accordance with the Committee's constitutional oversight responsibilities, we ask that Committee members and staff be briefed on and afforded the opportunity to review any legal analysis produced by your Department.\"",
      "Eisen, Painter and Canter are seeking a review by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, which serves as a version of an internal affairs office for the department. The office's public mission statement said it works \"to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal law enforcement agency.\"",
      "Separately on Tuesday, civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union\u00a0filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York seeking the public release of the OLC memo being used to justify the boat strikes and other documents related to the campaign. The groups said they're suing because the federal government has thus far failed to release the records they requested under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "\"The public deserves to know how the Trump administration is rubber-stamping the bombing of civilians in the Caribbean Sea, with no accountability,\" said Ify Chikezie, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union.",

      "GoFundMe said the words \"work,\" \"home,\" \"food,\" \"bill\" and \"care\" were among the top keywords in fundraisers' campaigns this year. \"Monthly bills\" were the second fastest-growing category, behind appeals for support for nonprofit groups.",

      "In the U.S., fundraisers to raise money for necessities like rent, groceries, housing and fuel surged 17% in 2025, according to GoFundMe. Company CEO Tim Cadogan said the platform has seen a steady increase in such campaigns in recent years.",
      "\"For example, we saw people say they were behind on the month's rent and were looking for friends and family to help them get through the next month or two,\" Cadogan told CBS News. \"This shows us that life is getting more expensive and folks are struggling with that, so they are reaching out to friends and family to see if they can help them through.\"",

    "summary": "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Philanthropist and billionaire MacKenzie Scott announced Tuesday she has given $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits so far in 2025, a major increase over her recent yearly contributions.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\"",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in February showed that Scott has donated to more than 2,000 nonprofits, and the median size was roughly $5 million.",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public-facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\"One of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\" Gasman told the Associated Press, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "Scott's recent donations to HBCU's include $50 million to\u00a0Norfolk State University, $63 million to\u00a0Prairie View A&M University\u00a0and $50 million to\u00a0Bowie State University.",
      "On Friday, Scott donated $25 million to Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \"mission aligned\" investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",
      "In her 2025 essay, Scott seemed to urge people toward action, writing, \"There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.\"",

      "Forty minutes passed. Then, a sound in the distance struck terror in Morgan all over again.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear somebody walking up.",
      "Unable to see, she feared her attacker had returned to finish the job.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear them shuffling, walking and they hit the stairs. \u2026 And I knew they were at the top when he hit the first board and it creaked really loud.",
      "That's when Morgan heard a very familiar voice.g",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Oh honey, what happened?\"",
      "Morgan's grueling ordeal was finally over. And who would turn out to be her rescuer? Her ex-husband Rod Metzer.",
      "A HERO TO THE RESCUE?",
      "When Morgan's ex-husband Rod Metzer turned up at her house, he immediately called 911.",
      "911 DISPATCHER: Cherokee County 911.",
      "ROD METZER: Somebody \u2014 somebody broke in over here.",
      "ROD METZER: She was on the back porch. Uh, and \u2014 and the back door was wide open.",
      "ROD METZER: She was tied up with a hood over her head.",
      "As they waited for help to arrive, Rod tried to console Morgan. Their conversation heard on the 911 call.",
      "MORGAN METZER (911 call): Please don't leave, Rod.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to be right here.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Please.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to leave the door open, OK?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He came up and \u2014 and rescued her on the back porch.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Saved her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Saved her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Her hero.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:\u00a0Absolutely.",
      "Sergeant Dakota Lyvers was a detective with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department in 2021. He had a lot of questions. Exactly why had Rod gone to Morgan's home in the middle of the night?",
      "Rod moved out of Morgan's home and into his own apartment shortly after the divorce, said Lyvers.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was \u2026 getting ready for bed. He was brushing his teeth when he heard knocking on his window. Um, that knocking was accompanied by a voice in which he could only decipher the word \"Morgan\" was being said.",
      "Concerned, Rod said he tried calling Morgan, but she didn't answer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say he was thinking? I mean, someone knocks on his window in the early morning hours of New Year's Day.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He obviously went to the worst. Um, he thought that that something was, uh, gonna happen to Morgan or something might be happening to Morgan.",
      "Rod told investigators he'd gotten in his car and made the 12-minute drive over to his ex-wife's house. Despite being divorced, Rod said he was still looking out for Morgan. Their relationship stretched back nearly 20 years.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How old were you when you met Rod?",
      "Morgan Metzer: 14 years old.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was it love at first sight?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes, it was. It was \u2014 it was scary how fast it was.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He was 17 at that time.",
      "Kathy Metzer is Rod's mother.",
      "Kathy Metzer: We were on the way to a baseball game and he said, \"Mom, you're gonna meet Morgan tonight.\" And I said, \"Who's Morgan?\" \"That's my girlfriend.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Be nice.\" (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did Rod change at all when he was dating Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, yeah. \u2026 There was nothing that she could mention that she didn't get.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How did he treat you?",
      "Morgan Metzer:\u00a0 Amazing. \u2026 He called me \"princess.\" And so he literally treated me like that.",
      "No one was surprised when the couple married in 2009. Morgan was 21 years old.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Morgan was one of the most gorgeous brides I've ever seen in my life.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Weather was perfect. It was outside, so thank goodness for the weather.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was everything I dreamed of. My dad gave me everything I could want, you know. \u2026 It was just precious.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was marriage like in the very beginning?",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was just awesome. \u2026 It's just you two. \u2026 You're mourning the loss of your, like, wedding being over (laughs) and your honeymoon. And it's like, \"I wanna go again!\"",
      "Unfortunately, their newly wedded bliss would be short-lived. Eight months after the wedding, Rod's younger brother Kevin, who wished the couple \"endless years of love, health and happiness,\" at their wedding, lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 19.",
      "Kathy Metzer: It really hit Rod hard. I mean, it \u2014 I don't think he was ever the same after that. \u2026 He depended on Morgan at that point, more than he did anybody. I don't think he left her side for more than an hour or two.",
      "But the next year would bring some good news to celebrate.",
      "Morgan Metzer: We got pregnant with our son.",
      "Morgan says picking his name was easy.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Kevin always wanted to be an uncle. He always talked about it, how much fun he would have.",
      "Kathy Metzer: They named him Kevin after my Kevin, Rod's brother. (cries)",
      "But the family would suffer a second, and devastating, loss. Baby Kevin was born early, with a congenital heart defect. He lived just 18 days.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He actually died on his due date.",
      "Nikki Battiste: The loss of a child is unthinkable and I would imagine tough for you and Rod.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Very tough. \u2026 Don't really remember a lot of it. It's a big blur with all the emotions.",
      "So it seemed like a miracle when, just three months later, Morgan discovered she was pregnant again. Kathy remembers the moment Rod showed her the ultrasound picture.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He says, \"what do you see?\" I said, \"a baby.\" He said, \"No. Look, what do you see?\" And I just screamed at the top of my lungs, \"two babies,\" you know. (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Twins.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Twins. They were gonna have twins.",
      "Morgan gave birth to a healthy boy and girl in 2012. It should have been a happy time but not long after, the marriage began to change.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Probably about a year after they were born, which is right around the time that Rod lost his job, is when it started going down south from there.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did Rod do for work?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He, he had so many jobs. His main one, when he lost all of his money, was he was being a day trader for himself.",
      "Rod's job loss happened to come at the same time Morgan's career was starting to flourish.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I started my own interior design business and it took off. \u2026 I just didn't expect it to boom and blow up.",
      "Morgan's company, Shiplap and Sugar, became so successful she asked Stabasefski to join her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: She was saying, you know, like \"I need help, I'm overwhelmed.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you became business partners?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: Yeah. \u2026 Making money. \u2026 Working our tails off, doing what we love.",
      "Morgan says her professional success, and Rod's lack of it, made for a dangerous combination. She says he began to abuse her \u2014 both physically and mentally. She recalls one Labor Day weekend. She and Rod were celebrating on a boat with friends and had just returned to their cabin.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I guess we had gotten into an argument about something, \u2026 that's the first night he beat the \u2014 he beat me.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you think, he hit me. I've gotta get out of here?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. I had my dad come and get me.",
      "Shockingly, Morgan says Rod tried to convince her, and the people closest to her, that she was to blame for her injuries.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He convinced my parents that I was the one that did it.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You were just out of control. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn't keep your temper. You were just whaling all over the place.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod claimed she got hurt because he was forced to physically restrain her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I'm like, OK, well, maybe that's my fault. \u2026 And my friends stopped talking to me then because he had no marks on him. It was all me.",
      "Morgan says that's when a new phase in the marriage began, one in which she started to doubt her own reality because, she says, Rod was gaslighting her \u2014 making her think every conflict Rod instigated actually began with her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I think she thought she was crazy. You know, you get programmed to think that you're crazy, like it's all in your head.",
      "Morgan says Rod even involved their children in his deception.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He pretended I pushed him down the stairs and he literally rolled down the stairs. You know, he actually got hurt and said to the kids, \"Look, Mommy pushed me downstairs. Can you believe that?\"",
      "Morgan says Rod sexually abused her as well, although she says it took a while for her to recognize what it was.",
      "Morgan Metzer: A lot of times he's very aggressive and wouldn't take the word no. And so now looking back on it, I guess he did sexually abuse me.",
      "Morgan filed for divorce in 2020.",
      "Nikki Battiste: When Morgan decided to \u2026 go through with the divorce, how was she handling it?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: You know, it was the first time I think I saw her have peace.",
      "The divorce was final in December and Morgan was ready to move on. But now, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, it appeared Rod had come back into her life as her hero.",
      "CRITICAL CLUES IN THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Sergeant Lyvers and Sergeant Robert Haugh recall that when they first arrived at Morgan's house at 3 a.m. Rod's behavior had struck them as unusual.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: So, as we were walking up \u2026 Rodney was, um, seated in his car right here \u2026 with another deputy.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he say anything?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah, he did. \u2026 He asked, \"Hey man, are you the guy that we've been waiting on? And I said, \"uh, yes, sir, I am.\" And then he replied, \"do your f****** job.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I was taken aback. I really was.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: This guy just had found his wife bound, um, and beaten on the back porch. And you would think that my arrival to help find a resolution to this, uh, would be welcoming.",
      "Immediately, Morgan's appearance startled the investigators.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Her eye was swollen shut, black and blue. \u2026 She still had the, uh, zip tie around her one wrist. And I was shocked, and I had seen a lot in my career. And, uh, I was surprised that somebody would \u2014 would be so harsh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did it make you think?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Somebody was mad.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Absolutely. It was an emotional attack.",
      "Morgan was not only physically injured; investigators could tell she had suffered psychologically after the attacker left her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: She was in fear that she was \u2014 someone was still back here watching her and that they were gonna kill her if she moved. And so she laid here and waited.",
      "Morgan was outside for 40 minutes before Rod arrived, but initially she thought it was just half that.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Morgan believed it to be somewhere around 15 to 20 minutes, max. Um, that was her perception of time.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Interesting. I would've thought the opposite, that would've felt longer for her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I agree. \u2026 When their adrenaline's going, you know, people perceive things differently.",
      "The first thing Lyvers and Haugh did was separate Morgan, Rod and Morgan's father and brother \u2014 who came over after she called them. Then Lyvers recorded his conversation with Morgan inside the house.",
      "Safely out of earshot of her ex-husband, who was standing just outside, Morgan told investigators that she suspected her attacker was the man pretending to be her hero.",
      "MORGAN METZER: I just thought it was him.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: When you say \"him,\" you're talking about your ex-husband?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "Morgan said she had no idea who her assailant was when the attack began, but then came one critical moment.",
      "Morgan Metzer: When he said \u2026 \"you're going to miss your husband,\" I said, \"no, don't hurt my husband. I love him very much.\" And I don't know what made me do that. But at that exact moment is when \u2026 the mood of the room changed. I knew I was going to live.",
      "And then there was another, even bigger clue, when her attacker lifted Morgan off the bed to place her outside.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's when I really knew it was him.",
      "Morgan remembered something from years earlier.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was pregnant with my kids, my twins. And sometimes you have to get help out of the bed. \u2026 The way he gently held me and got me out of bed, it was so familiar that I was like, this is him. I know it's 100% percent him.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't going to let him know that I knew it was him. Because if he did then he \u2014 I didn't know what he was going to do.",
      "She told them the attack had followed a chaotic week which began with very troubling news.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He thinks he's got pancreatic cancer.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He just called me \u2026 \u00a0and said, \"I've got pancreatic cancer.\" And so I rushed to go see him. \u2026 I said, \"you're the father of my children. \u2026 I'm here for you.\"",
      "Morgan Metzer: He showed me doctor's notes and whatnot.",
      "Rod had told no one else and Morgan explained that she'd been letting him stay at her house.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He'd been sleeping on my sofa because he had been really freaked out and upset obviously.",
      "Morgan told the investigators that Rod had spent the week trying to reconcile with her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He kept begging me to get back together with me. \u2026 Just constantly haggling me.",
      "But Morgan says she had no interest. By the morning of Dec. 31, she'd had enough. Feeling the pressure of being his sole emotional support, Morgan insisted Rod share his health news with his parents.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"no, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.\" And that's when I was like, \"OK, get out.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod spent the day texting her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You need to get back with me. I'll make enough money. You can quit your job right now.\"",
      "Fed up with it all, Morgan lied and told Rod she'd be sleeping elsewhere that New Year's Eve night.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Staying at my parents' house tonight. I'm turning my phone off.\" Like, give me some space.",
      "As Morgan shared her suspicions with investigators, she didn't know if they would accept what she was telling them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I've been mentally, emotionally, physically abused.",
      "Because Rod made her feel like she was to blame for years.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's what he's built in my brain.",
      "But that all changed when Lyvers told her he believed her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I just melted. \u2026 He heard me. I have not been heard in years. Nobody listened. Nobody heard me and he heard me.",
      "Rachel Ashe: That started the investigation into Rodney Metzer.",
      "Rachel Ashe is the Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney for Cherokee County. She works exclusively on domestic violence cases. Parker, an emotional support dog, is often with her to comfort victims. Ashe says investigators were perplexed that Rod had come to Morgan's house that night after she'd told him she'd be at her parents' home.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Why did you even come here? Why didn't you go to her parents' house? Why didn't \u2014 why didn't you check with her parents?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He claimed it was just habit, normal.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"It's what I would do.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you scratching your heads?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: A little bit.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: We questioned him on it.",
      "Rod said that after hearing that knocking on his window, and someone saying Morgan's name, he tried phoning Morgan to warn her. Haugh wanted to check.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think that's what prompted, \"hey, where's your phone?\"",
      "Rod handed his cellphone to the investigators.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Gave them permission to look through his phone.",
      "And what they found came as a surprise.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was an Apple iPhone, and it had a hidden folder. \u2026 And in the hidden folder were images of Morgan \u2014 um, partially dressed.",
      "Rachel Ashe: A lot of photos of Morgan nude and those photos of Morgan nude, it was pretty apparent that she didn't know he was taking those photos of her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was quite alarmed.",
      "Investigators also discovered Rod had snapped pictures of Morgan's cellphone showing text messages between her and another man. They considered these and the photos of Morgan to be an invasion of privacy.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: You didn't have that permission. Y'all don't have that relationship. She's f****** baffled that you have that. That's stalkerish.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We knew we had to \u2026 get him in custody \u2026 while we started doing search warrants and started investigating \u2026 to prevent him from destroying evidence.",
      "ROD METZER: People make mistakes, man.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I think you made a lot of mistakes.",
      "SGT. ROBERT HAUGH: Big, big mistakes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you arrested him for having taken those photos secretly?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Stand up.",
      "ROD METZER: You're kidding me?",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Nope, we're not kidding you. Stand up. This is not a joke. C'mon.",
      "But could investigators prove that Rod had attacked Morgan that night?",
      "ZIP TIES AND ALARMING INTERNET SEARCHES",
      "Morgan Metzer: Watched him get, uh, arrested, walk to the car, and be put in. It was kind of like, is this really happening?",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was any part of you sad?",
      "Morgan Metzer: No, not at the time. It was angry and just sore.",
      "Even as they booked Rod for taking those pictures of Morgan and her texts, Haugh and Lyvers had already developed a theory about why Rod might have attacked her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I believe, he thought he was going to come in and \u2014 and rescue her and be the savior and, uh \u2014 and win her back.",
      "Investigators hoped home security cameras would support their theory. But they quickly learned that all the video from the time of the attack had been erased through the app on Morgan's phone that the assailant had used to unlock her back porch door when he left. Morgan's attacker took her phone with him. It was never recovered.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you ever able to retrieve those missing videos from the security company?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: No. \u2026 Once videos are deleted, they're deleted from their cloud.",
      "But since Morgan had a home security system, how did the attacker get in without setting off the alarm? It did not take long to figure out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: This is the window the attacker entered?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct. Right here is the, uh \u2014 the window that we found the screen was actually removed.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That basement window \u2026 had an alarm sensor that was removed from the window and put together on the windowsill. So, if the window was to open, it would appear, you know, to the alarm system that the sensor is still making contact.",
      "Investigators believed Rod had disabled the sensor while he was staying at Morgan's house that week.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night.",
      "Although the home security videos had been erased, there was other video from prior to the attack. The camera on Morgan's front porch caught Rod earlier that evening.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He had sent me a picture of a check\u2026. And he's like, \"it's underneath your front porch.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was for $56,000 and change.",
      "Morgan says the message Rod sent with the picture of the check made it seem like he was trying to make a grand gesture.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You should have all the money. You deserve everything,\" pretty much in a nutshell.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think it was to get her to come back to the house that evening because \u2026 she told Rodney she was gonna be at her parents' house for New Year's.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Morgan returned to the house, retrieved it, and kind of made some sort of a \u2014 uh \u2014 of a gesture and she walked back into the house and put it on the kitchen countertop.",
      "Morgan's attacker took that check with him. It was never found.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you find out about Rod's finances?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:: That check would've bounced.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yeah, he was broke.",
      "The day after his arrest, investigators executed search warrants on Rod's car and his apartment. As soon as they walked through the door, they found a key piece of evidence.",
      "Rachel Ashe: They located this bag of zip ties in his apartment. And \u2026 a portion of a zip tie.",
      "Before arriving at her house, Morgan's attacker had pre-looped the zip ties he'd put on her wrists.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was working in the dark. He was handcuffing somebody. You never know how much fight that person's going to put up.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: One of the zip ties actually, um, was pretty unique because it had two, um \u2014 other zip ties that had been, uh, ratcheted onto it and then cut. And so basically what we were looking at was a \u2014 a zip tie that had two extra heads.",
      "Haugh and Lyvers needed to find out if that portion of a zip tie, essentially a tail, found in Rod's apartment, lined up with one of the extra heads on Morgan's restraints. They headed to their crime lab.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So these are the zip ties that were actually found on Morgan?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yes, they are.",
      "Melanie Thrasher is a crime scene technician.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was able to match the \u2014 this tail to one of the heads on the zip tie for Morgan's wrist.",
      "The striations on the tail found in Rod's apartment lined up exactly with those on Morgan's zip tie. A \"perfect match\" said Haugh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think when you saw this?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That we were going to be adding charges to his, uh, existing booking. \u2026 And we had our guy. \u2026 I would've never, you know, imagined, uh, having a piece of evidence like this.",
      "But the search warrant of Rod's apartment yielded even more. There was a book \u2014",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \"7 Ways to \u2014",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"To Be Her Hero.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \u2014 \"Be Her Hero,\" to \u2014 to win somebody back.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That gave us the motive. \u2026 It added to that motive.",
      "Investigators examined Rod's browser history.",
      "Rachel Ashe:\u00a0 The searches \u2026 were very disturbing.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He was researching \"how to change your voice.\"",
      "Rachel Ashe: \"How long to choke somebody unconscious.\"",
      "The searches also included \"How to crack an iPhone password,\" \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and one that was especially appalling.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He Google searched \u2026 \"cancer diagnosis letters.\"",
      "Investigators searched Rod's outgoing emails. There they found Rod had set up a fake email account to create the pancreatic cancer diagnosis letter he'd shown Morgan. And there was more.",
      "Rachel Ashe: He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. \u2026 All of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He wasn't sick at all?",
      "Rachel Ashe: No. \u2026 He did not have cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you think that he faked the cancer diagnosis as a way to try to get you back or as a way to get access to your house 'cause he had this plan?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I think it was to get me back. It might have been both.",
      "On Jan. 3, two days after the attack, Lyvers and Sergeant Tom Harris interviewed Rod. They talked to him about his health.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You said you're diabetic",
      "ROD METZER: Yes.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What other kind of health issues do you have?",
      "ROD METZER: Nothing as far as I know of yet.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I thought you had cancer.",
      "Lyvers confronted Rod about the cancer diagnosis he'd faked to Morgan.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: How did you tell her that \u2026 this \u2014 this cancer thing?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know if I should talk to you guys anymore. I'm starting to get a really bad feeling. What angle you guys are coming from.",
      "Then Rod tried to turn the tables \u2014 by attempting to take the upper hand in the interview.",

      "MORGAN METZER: Yep. I thought I was dead. But then also part of me was like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let myself die. \u2026 I have gotta fight for my kids.",
      "Harris told Morgan they'd watched the home security video of Rod arriving at her house after her attack. He rang the front doorbell but when there was no response, headed around to the back.",

      "ROD METZER (jail phone call): Why is she doing this to me? She knows it wasn't me.",

      "Rachel Ashe: The sheriff's office then went to the two Lowe's that we have here in Cherokee County. \u2026 And they started searching for transactions.",
      "It didn't take long. Rod Metzer had purchased those zip ties on Dec. 30 \u2014 about 36 hours before the attack; easy to find because he paid with his debit card. Investigators obtained the security video from Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This was during COVID and this was during a period where everybody was wearing a mask, except for Rodney Metzer. So the surveillance images and the videos that were recovered from Lowe's of him purchasing those zip ties \u2026 his face is right there in the camera.",
      "Next came the security video from Rod's apartment building.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: There's actually one inside the, uh \u2014 the breezeway there, which leads to Rodney's apartment specifically.",
      "Lyvers says there was no video of Rod leaving after he said someone knocked on his window.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: What we do see is after the time of the incident that Morgan was attacked, Rodney come in, disheveled, in a hurry.",
      "Just four minutes later, Rod is caught on camera again, leaving the building, wearing completely different clothes and sneakers, and carrying a plastic bag. The time stamp was 1:24 a.m.",

      "Rachel Ashe: We just don't know where that went.",

      "Rachel Ashe: This is a prosecutor's dream to put up because the evidence in this case was overwhelming, overwhelming.",
      "But Ashe says she wanted to offer Morgan an opportunity for quicker closure than a trial would bring in the form of a plea deal for Rod.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We went through the pros and cons of letting him plead guilty, letting him accept responsibility. \u2026 We agreed, um, we should try. He took it quickly.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2021, Rod pleaded guilty to a total of 14 counts related to Morgan's attack and the photos found on his phone.",

      "Nikki Battiste: How was it to listen to your best friend read this incredibly powerful statement?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: It was awesome because she did not cry. \u2026 Her voice did not shake \u2026 and she said everything she needed to say, and when she was done, she was done.",

    "summary": "Rod Metzer tried to gain sympathy from his ex-wife, Morgan Metzer, by pretending he had cancer, going as far as creating a diagnosis letter and a bill for his alleged treatment.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day 2021 in Canton, Georgia, Morgan Metzer was awakened to a terrifying sight. A man wearing a mask and all black clothing was standing at her bedroom doorway. The man ran and jumped on top of her. \"That's when he started pistol-whipping me,\" Morgan said. The assailant used zip ties to constrain her wrists before strangling her nearly unconscious twice.",
      "\"'You're gonna regret this, you've done really wrong now,'\" Morgan recalled the man told her in a deep and gravelly voice that he seemed to be trying to disguise. She said it sounded like Batman. Morgan Metzer's harrowing attack is the focus of this week's all-new \"48 Hours\" reported by contributor Nikki Battiste. An encore of \u00a0\"The 'Batman' Intruder\" airs Saturday, Dec. 13 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Afterward, the attacker placed a pillowcase over her head and picked Morgan up and left her on the back porch, which was connected to the bedroom. He told her not to move until she heard two car honks or he'd kill her. Then all went quiet except the sound of the stream near her secluded home.",
      "Forty minutes passed, but then terror struck again. Morgan heard someone walking towards her and up the porch steps. Initially terrified her attacker had returned, she was surprised to hear a familiar voice.",
      "\"'Oh honey, what happened?'\" Morgan remembered her ex-husband, Rod Metzer, said when he found her.",
      "Rod called 911 and law enforcement showed up to the scene. Rod's rescue of his ex-wife appeared to be an act of heroism.",
      "Rod said he had been looking out for Morgan despite their divorce, which came after a nearly 20-year history together. They started dating when Morgan was 14 and Rod was 17 before marrying in their early 20s. The couple had twins, who were spending a few days with Morgan's sister in Florida when the attack occurred.",
      "Morgan said her decision to file for divorce came after years of what she described as mental and physical abuse from Rod. Rod moved out of Morgan's home into his own apartment and Morgan was ready to move on. Their divorce was finalized just weeks before the attack.",
      "However, this new start for Morgan was cut short. Earlier in the week, Morgan said Rod called her with shocking news that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "\"And so I rushed to go see him,\" Morgan told Battiste. \"He showed me doctors' notes and whatnot.\" She allowed Rod to stay at her home to help him cope with his diagnosis. \"I needed to be supportive still because it's the father of my children.\"",
      "During this time, Morgan said Rod was constantly trying to get back together with her. But she had no interest and on the morning of New Year's Eve, she told Rod he needed to share his health news with his parents.",
      "\"He said, 'No, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.' And that's when I was like, 'OK, get out,'\" Morgan recalled. Morgan said Rod left, but still spent the day texting her about reconciling. Fed up, Morgan lied and told Rod she was going to sleep at her parents' home that New Year's Eve night.",
      "How Rod knew Morgan was at her home, along with the coincidental timing of his arrival after her attack, raised questions with investigators who spoke to Rod at the scene. Rod said he was planning on spending the night at his apartment. However, he told them he heard someone knock on his ground floor apartment window and say Morgan's name. After Rod tried calling Morgan with no answer, he decided to drive to her house to check on her. He told investigators that going to her house instead of her parents' was just out of habit.",
      "After interviewing both Morgan and Rod at the scene, investigators became suspicious of Rod's story. They ordered search warrants on Rod's apartment, car and electronic devices, uncovering his internet search history. The searches included, \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and \"How to change the sound of your voice.\" One search also stood out to investigators: \"cancer letter from hospital.\"",
      "Investigators also discovered a fake email account created by Rod, posing as a doctor, to send the cancer diagnosis letter that he showed Morgan. But there was even more.",
      "\"He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer,\" said Rachel Ashe, the deputy chief assistant district attorney for Cherokee County. She said Rod \"did all of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.\" He never did.",
      "Rod Metzer eventually pleaded guilty to 14 counts relating to the attack on Morgan Metzer. He was sentenced to 70 years \u2014 25 in prison followed by an additional 45 years of probation.",

CBS News previously reported that many of the men do not have criminal convictions.",
      "The men imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a U.S.-brokered swap over the summer.

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Beating back inflation is only half the battle in lowering the cost of living \u2014 you also have to think about people's pay, economists argue.",
    "story": [
      "Mounting public attention on the struggle millions of Americans face affording food, housing and other daily necessities has largely centered on what can be done to quash inflation. Yet some economists say the discussion is incomplete without addressing another major reason life has become unaffordable for so many people: their\u00a0meager paychecks.",
      "\"It's not just about how much things cost. Affordability is truly about, 'Does an individual have enough money to buy the things they want?' So it's not about making things cheaper, but making it so you earn more so that the stuff you need is affordable,\" Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday evening is expected to address cost-of-living concerns and other economic issues at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pa. Although he has at times dismissed claims that the U.S. faces an affordability crisis, his administration has also taken steps to offer relief.",
      "In November, for example, Mr. Trump removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. The president last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "\"Your money doesn't go as far\"",
      "To be sure, controlling inflation is critical, as well as an explicit aim under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to keep both unemployment and prices in check. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, describes prices and wages as \"two sides of the same coin.\"",
      "\"You can achieve the same standard of living by either raising wages or lowering costs or both,\" he added. \"So it is important to deal with cost-of-living issues if you want to improve living standards, but raising wages also works.\"",
      "Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Department of Labor under Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017, thinks a better way to make life more affordable is to raise worker wages so their dollars stretch further. She also favors providing government subsidies to help ease the burden of affording essential \u2014 and increasingly costly \u2014 services such as child care and health care.",
      "One-third of middle-class families struggle to afford housing\u00a0and child care, according to a recent\u00a0report from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford things beyond the bare essentials, according to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. The research firm has found that the bottom 60% of income earners in the U.S. have difficulty affording expenses such as higher education, transportation and even the basic technology required for their jobs.",
      "\"There are some things that feel out of reach that didn't feel like they were out of reach in the past,\" said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Your money doesn't go as far as it used to.\"",
      "Why prices may not drop much",
      "Economists note that prices don't generally decline broadly unless the economy is in a recession, with presidential administrations and even the Fed having a limited toolkit for addressing severe bouts of inflation. Meanwhile, a sharp, across-the-board drop in prices can indicate a dangerous erosion in consumer demand, leading to an economic downturn.",
      "\"Overall, it's very rare and not a good thing to have outright deflation across the economy,\" the Cato Institute's Lincicome told CBS News.",
      "Indeed, millions of people would have to lose their jobs, and then cut their spending, for demand to slow enough for companies to broadly reduce their prices, according to Shierholz.",
      "\"In order to bring the overall price level down, you have to have a massive recession because people are not demanding stuff, because they don't have any income,\" she added. \"That's how you get a drop in the overall price level.\"",
      "Affordability fixes?",
      "Shierholz favors a range of policies for driving both short- and long-term wage growth. First and foremost, the U.S. could boost the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "Local governments aren't waiting around for the feds to take action, with dozens of states in recent years adopting higher baseline wages. In 2026,\u00a0minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 19 states and 49 cities and counties starting on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.",
      "Reforming labor laws to make it easier for workers to form a union can also lead to higher wages for workers, Shieholz said. Equally important, in her view, is providing a robust social safety net. That includes providing ample unemployment insurance benefits so workers who lose their jobs can stay afloat financially.",
      "\"That actually raises wages because it gives workers power,\" she said. \"By contrast, if your employer knows you'll drop into poverty if you give up or lose your job, you're going to be much less able to make any risky demands.\"",
      "The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonpartisan group focused on economic equality, also argues in a new report\u00a0that expanding unemployment insurance benefits helps low-income workers find better-paying jobs.",
      "Although surging employee pay can fuel inflation under certain conditions, De Rugy of the Mercatus Center said that rising wages rooted in strong economic growth \"actually improves affordability, because it tends to shift the bargaining power toward employees.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Jasmine Crockett filed paperwork to run for U.S. Senate just hours before the state's deadline \u2014 and hours after fellow Democrat Colin Allred dropped out.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Jasmine Crockett on Monday filed paperwork to run for Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in Texas, a source tells CBS News Texas, hours ahead of a planned news conference where she announced her plans.",
      "\"I'm done with going along to get along, and it gets us nowhere,\" Crockett said during her announcement Monday. \"I'm done watching rural hospitals and public schools close their doors. I'm done watching parents be afraid to send their kids to school or the mall or the movies because Republicans have flooded our streets with guns. I'm done with the Senators sitting around doing nothing, while Trump takes your hard-earned money, skims your Social Security, slashes Medicare, and gives tax breaks to billionaires. I'm done. I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring. I'm asking for your support to be the next United States Senator from the great state of Texas.\"",
      "In the Democratic primary, Crockett will face state Rep. James Talarico of Austin, whose campaign has generated national headlines and who raised a record $6.2 million in the first three weeks of his campaign announcement.",
      "After Crockett filed her paperwork, Talarico issued a statement saying, \"We're building a movement in Texas \u2014 fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state. Our movement is rooted in unity over division \u2014 so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\"",
      "Republican incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt are also locked in a closely-watched battle for the GOP nomination. The final general election matchup is expected to be one of the most expensive races in the 2026 national cycle.",
      "Paxton's campaign issued a statement Monday bashing the Dallas Democrat as \"Crazy Crockett,\" but mostly alleging Cornyn has sunken tens of millions of dollars in the race even though \"he's in third place in the primary.\"",
      "Crockett's entry into the race comes after another Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas, dropped out of the race earlier Monday. Instead of filing his paperwork to run in the Senate race, he opted to file to run for the newly-drawn 33rd Congressional District in Dallas County.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the newly-redrawn congressional map could be used in the 2026 election, which included redrawing three Dallas-area districts that are represented by Democrats.",
      "In a statement earlier Monday, Allred said, \"In the past few days, I've come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt. That's why I've made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate. But I'm nowhere near done serving my community and our state. Today, I'm announcing my campaign for Congress to represent the newly drawn Congressional District 33.\"",
      "Before the announcement, some Democrats had expressed disappointment that there could be three major candidates for the U.S. Senate race, instead of spreading out among the other statewide races such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.",
      "In an interview last month, Crockett told CBS News Texas that she would only for U.S. Senate if polling showed she could win a general election, not just the Democratic primary. In the interview, she said she would share her internal polling with Talarico and Allred. \"I'm going to open it up to them because this isn't about me ... It would be really, really, really hard for me now knowing that my district is still at least in its current configuration and knowing that my district absolutely wants me to continue to represent them wholly; it would be really, really hard. But at the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district. It's bigger than the state of Texas. This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "During the interview, the Crockett said she polling for the March 3 primary but instead focusing on the general election next November. Various Democrats have said they believe Paxton will win the Republican primary and because of his political baggage, they think the party has a chance to win a statewide seat for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Crockett said for her to win, she could not count on Republicans crossing over to support her. \"When we ended up with the Trump phenomena or even when we ended up with the Obama phenomenon, they were able to both bring out people that historically did not vote. I think that's the only way that we win in Texas is if we have a candidate that can add to the electorate. If the electorate remains the same electorate that we've had over the last 30 years, then I think we're going to end up with the same result,\" she said.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Crockett confirmed she spoke with both Talarico and Allred about the Senate race.",
      "Crockett has made national headlines by clashing with President Trump. When asked if she will energize Republicans in addition to Democrats, Matt Angle, Director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told CBS News Texas, \"She could. I think that that's the real challenge is for her to be able to increase turnout for not just her race, but for other Democrats without motivating Republicans. I've been doing politics in Texas a long time. Republicans don't have much to brag about at any level. I'm not sure that being upset with one or two Democrats is going to overcome the fact that they're profoundly disappointed with Republican leadership that's failing them.\"",
      "Vinny Minchillo, a Republican consultant in North Texas, told CBS News Texas that he agrees with those who believe Crockett cannot win a general election statewide. \"I think she's a real polarizing candidate. She's fun to watch in which she goes crazy on the news. It's always interesting to watch. But I just don't think that's going to work in a general election. I think she is too extreme and too far left for even Texas Democrats,\" Minchillo said. \"I think she'll help turn out Republicans because Republicans are not going to be comfortable with that.\"",
      "Minchillo said he believes the Republican primary is headed for a runoff but doesn't know for sure which two candidates will make advance.",
      "\"We got a long way to go. This has already been a nasty race to begin with. Cornyn came out of the gate saying that he was going to take Paxton to the woodshed and put in words stronger than that. This has been pretty nasty. Cornyn has spent the summer pounding on Paxton. He's moved numbers in his favor. Now, we're seeing a little bit of back and forth. So, this is going to be really rough. The Cornyn folks have actually opened a second front. They're starting to beat on Wesley Hunt. So that's going to be tough. I don't see a path to be honest for Hunt. I just don't think he can beat either Cornyn or Paxton. Maybe a better chance to beat Cornyn, but I just don't think he can get there unless he's got a lot of money,\" Minchillo said",
      "Minchillo predicts that between all of the candidates and their campaigns, plus the third-party groups that support them for both the primary, primary runoff, and general election, tat the Senate race could cost at least $750 million.",
      "With Crockett's decision to run for the Senate, she will leave behind the 30th Congressional District she has represented since 2023. As CBS News Texas reported last week, Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Fort Worth, will file to run in the newly drawn 30th District, which mostly includes parts of Dallas County and a portion of eastern Tarrant County. Veasey has represented the current 33rd Congressional District, which stretches from his hometown of Fort Worth to Dallas, since 2013.",
      "Frederick Haynes, III, senior pastor at the Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas, has also explored running for the 30th Congressional District and confirmed he was aware of an effort to draft him to run.",
      "The newly drawn 33rd Congressional District is now entirely within Dallas County and a majority Latino district. Allred will face Democratic Rep.Julie Johnson of Farmers Branch, who succeeded Allred in the 32nd Congressional District after he ran for U.S. Senate last year against Republican Senator Ted Cruz.",
      "The newly drawn 32nd Congressional District moves from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority. Republican candidates include Ryan Binkley, Darrell Day, Aimee Carrasco, Monty Montanez and Paul Bondar.",
      "Longtime Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California briefly considered running in this North Texas district but changed his mind after meeting with Mr. Trump. He will run for reelection in his San Diego-area district, which was redrawn by Democrats in California to neutralize Texas' redistricting. State Rep. Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, also considered running for this seat, but has announced she is running for re-election in her Texas House district.",

    "summary": "Congress has enacted limits on how much money a political committee can spend in coordination with a federal candidate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with the legality of federal limits on the amount of money a political committee can spend in coordination with a federal candidate, hearing a case that could join a line of recent fights that have led the high court to dismantle campaign finance restrictions.",
      "The dispute, known as NRSC v. FEC, involves caps imposed by Congress on what are called coordinated party expenditures through the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which was passed to regulate the financing of federal campaigns.",
      "For the 2023 to 2024 election cycle, party committees could spend between $61,800 to $123,000 for House seats and between $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate seats, according to the FEC. Congress amended the law in 2014 to allow unlimited coordinated spending on certain activities, such as election-recount lawsuits and other legal proceedings.",
      "The legal battle before the high court was brought in 2022 by then-Senate candidate JD Vance, then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio and two GOP committees, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "The Republicans sued the FEC and argued that the coordinated spending limits violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. A federal appeals court upheld the caps, citing a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that had left them in place.",
      "The Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court. The FEC under President Trump agrees that the spending limits burden the rights of political parties and candidates\u00a0 and should be struck down. The high court appointed a lawyer, Roman Martinez, to argue in defense of the restrictions, and allowed a trio of Democratic Party committees to intervene.",
      "Oral arguments",
      "Over the course of the arguments on Tuesday, three of the court's conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, appeared likely to strike down the spending caps as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "Kavanaugh repeatedly expressed concern about the power of political parties and whether they have been weakened relative to outside groups like super PACs because of campaign finance laws and the Supreme Court's decisions. That weakening has \"negative effects on our constitutional democracy,\" he said.",
      "\"The parties have been weakened overall, and this case is at least \u2026 starts to restore the strength of parties, although obviously it doesn't get them all the way there in competing with outside groups,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch did not ask any questions, and Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probed lawyers only sparingly.",
      "In one early exchange, Roberts pressed Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of the Republicans, on whether there is a distinction between spending by parties and candidates, and contributions to their campaigns. He called it a \"fiction\" that coordinated expenditures are not direct contributions to candidates, which are subject to limitations under federal law.",
      "The three liberal justices, meanwhile, warned that lifting these restrictions could open the door to corruption and allow donors to funnel bribes to candidates through the political party committees in circumvention of limits on direct contributions.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor took aim at the Supreme Court's string of recent rulings that have rolled back campaign finance laws, beginning with its 2010 ruling in the case Citizens United v. FEC, which struck down prohibitions on political spending by corporations.",
      "\"Every time we interfere with the congressional design, we make matters worse,\" she said, adding that the court's \"tinkering causes more harm than good.\"",
      "\"Once we take off this coordinated expenditure limit, then what's left?\" she asked Francisco. \"What's left is nothing, no control whatsoever.\"",
      "But Sarah Harris, the principal deputy solicitor general, rejected the suggestion that Congress imposed the caps solely to prevent corruption in the campaign-finance system.",
      "\"We think the design of that scheme completely refutes any quid pro quo interest and reveals \u2026 that the real interest is in trying to have Congress and its incumbents prescribe how much money is appropriate in particular contexts, how much money should be spent in particular election contexts,\" Harris said.",
      "Martinez, the court-appointed lawyer defending the restrictions, said that the Republicans and the Trump administration are asking the Supreme Court to overturn 50 years of campaign finance law and said the justices should dismiss the case on the grounds that it is moot. The FEC doesn't believe the coordinated spending caps are constitutional, and an executive order from Mr. Trump effectively bars it from enforcing the rules, he said.",
      "\"No one thinks President Trump is going to enforce this law and target his own vice president,\" he told the Supreme Court.",
      "Martinez also noted that Vance is not a candidate for federal office and has declined to definitively say whether he will run for president in 2028, so he is not harmed by the limits.",
      "Alito, however, wasn't convinced.",
      "\"Isn't that what [all] potential candidates always say until the day when they make the announcement?\" he said.",
      "Martinez also warned that while the Republicans are asking only to strike down the limits on coordinated party spending, it's likely they will be back before the Supreme Court urging it to dismantle a host of other campaign finance rules, like restrictions on how much donors can give to parties.",
      "\"You're going to be deluged with petitions, the dominos are going to fall and you're going to have to reconstruct campaign finance law from the ground up,\" he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is likely to issue a decision by the end of June or early day, just months before the 2026 midterm elections.",

    "summary": "Majority Leader John Thune announced that the Senate will vote on a Republican-led measure alongside a Democratic bill to extend expiring tax credits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday that Republicans intend to put up a GOP-led health care bill for a vote alongside Democrats' proposal to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits later this week.",
      "\"This program desperately needs to be reformed, the Democrats have decided, 'We're not going to do anything to reform it,' and so we'll see where the votes are on Thursday,\" Thune said at a news conference following a lunch meeting of Republican senators on Tuesday. \"But we will have an alternative that we will put up that reflects the views of the Republicans here in the United States Senate.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, outlined that the Senate will vote on a measure unveiled earlier this week by GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho.",
      "The legislation, named the Health Care Freedom for Patients Act, doesn't extend the enhanced tax credits. Instead, it would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges.",
      "\"It actually does make health insurance premiums more affordable,\" Thune said. \"It delivers the benefit directly to the patient, not to the insurance company, and it does it in a way that actually saves money to the taxpayer. That is a win-win proposal.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking shortly after Thune, called the Cassidy-Crapo bill \"junk insurance.\"",
      "Thune's announcement comes as Democrats plan to bring up a three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for a vote on Thursday. Democrats have the option to put forward a bill of their choosing as part of the agreement that ended the government shutdown.",
      "The enhanced premium tax credit helped around 22 million low- and middle-income Americans purchase health insurance in 2025. Premium costs are expected to\u00a0increase\u00a0by an average of more than $1,000 annually when they expire in January, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And KFF\u00a0estimated\u00a0that the expiration of the tax credits would more than double annual premiums, from $888 on average in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.",
      "The planned Democratic measure in the Senate is highly unlikely to pick up support from enough Republicans to advance, although Democrats hope it will force GOP members to take a politically unpopular vote against extending the subsidies. A side-by-side vote on a GOP proposal would likely alleviate some pressure on Republicans, though some have advocated against the exercise, since it wouldn't likely produce a solution.",
      "Senate Republicans have been considering their path forward for weeks, and a number of other GOP lawmakers have unveiled their own plans in recent days. Some of those proposals would extend the tax credits with new limits, including a plan from Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Susan Collins of Maine that would extend them by two years. Another plan from Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas would extend the credits by one year before redirecting funds into HSA-style accounts in 2027.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, the GOP-led bill is not expected to pick up enough support to reach the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate. The Democratic bill is also expected to fall short.",
      "Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that Republicans don't see the Democratic bill \"as a law-making exercise.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly don't, which is why they're putting up what is a show vote \u2014 it's a messaging bill,\" Thune said. \"And then we'll see after that whether or not they are serious about doing something, and if there are at least enough of them to find a path forward. We'll see.\"",
      "Thune said Democrats' plan is designed \"to make a political point.\"",
      "\"At some point if they want to make a law, I think we've got people on our side who are interested in doing that,\" he added.",

      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",

      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",

      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",

    "story": [
      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010. The U.S. needs 4.7 million housing units to keep up with demand, according to a July analysis from Zillow, an online real estate marketplace.",
      "In 2024 (the latest date for which figures are available), the median household income in the U.S. after adjusting for inflation was nearly $84,000, according to Census data. That is far less than the $113,000 in annual income needed to buy a typical home, which now costs around $435,000, according to Bankrate.",
      "In the country's priciest cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle, households must earn at least $200,000 a year to afford the median-priced home.",
      "As of 2025, about 65% of U.S. households owned their own home, down from a peak of more than 69% in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "By contrast, in some parts of the South and West, where home construction has picked up in some markets, there are glimmers of hope, Gailey said, pointing to stronger tax incentives and looser permitting requirements as policies that could boost construction.",
      "\"Those regions have brighter outlooks than the Northeast and Midwest, where building has lagged, and inventory levels remain well below pre-pandemic norms,\" she said.",
      "Aspiring homebuyers could see some relief in 2026. Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from the 6.6% average in 2025, according to Realtor.com.",

      "Macleod was walking his dogs when he was hit by a car on Saturday, the Hopkinton Police Department said in a news release. The alleged driver was identified by police as as Shannon Godbout. She is 41, CBS Boston reported, and was driving recklessly.",

    "summary": "National Democrats have deployed resources for County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, while Mr. Trump has endorsed former City Manager Emilio Gonzalez.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Democrat Eileen Higgins won the mayoral runoff election with about 59% of the vote.",
      "It's been more than 30 years since Miami last elected a Democrat to serve as mayor, but the party feels this might be its best shot to reclaim victory in decades, as its candidate said a win would be a referendum on President Trump's immigration policy.",
      "\"What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they're not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they're also sinful,\" Eileen Higgins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said.",
      "Higgins, a county commissioner, is facing a runoff election against Republican hopeful Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, Miami-Dade County commissioner and director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush.",
      "\"My opponent would like this to be a referendum on the president,\" said Gonzalez, who has been endorsed by Mr. Trump. \"I want our voters to make this a referendum on me.\"",
      "While the race is technically a nonpartisan election, national Democrats have deployed resources for Higgins, including an endorsement video by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a visit from Arizona's Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego and a canvassing event with former Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel.",
      "Higgins came in first in the Nov. 4 election with 36% of the vote, followed by Gonzalez's 19% \u2014 but since neither candidate reached 50% in a 13-person field, a runoff election between the top two candidates is set for Tuesday. Adding to the Democratic Party's optimism is early voting data, which shows Democrats outpacing Republicans by about 8%.",
      "Florida Republicans have sought to downplay the significance of Tuesday's election. The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.",
      "Yet a win for Democrats in Florida, Mr. Trump's adopted home state, and in the city that is set to become the site for his presidential library, would be a reversal in fortune for Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump handily won the state in 2024 by more than 13%. Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years. Statewide, Republicans have a 10-point registration lead over Democrats.",
      "\"She's certainly running a lot of high-energy efforts on the ground there, bringing in a big coalition, bringing in all types of folks to support her. I certainly think she has a great shot,\" said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee Chair. \"Will be a big, big win if we win that.\"",
      "The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump again weighed in on the race Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social: \"Miami's Mayor Race is Tuesday. It is a big and important race!!! Vote for Republican Gonzalez. He is FANTASTIC! You can also vote today. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The city of Miami has a population that is 57% foreign-born, according to the 2024 U.S. Census, and about half are naturalized U.S. Citizens who would be eligible to vote in the election. While Hispanic voters nationally trend toward the Democratic Party, in South Florida, Republicans have found a stronghold among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan exiles who fled communist and socialist governments.",
      "However, Mr. Trump's immigration policy has come to something of a flashpoint in Florida. In addition to state troopers carrying out increased immigration enforcement, the Sunshine State is also home to the controversial \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center. The recent end of Temporary Protected Status for over 250,000 Venezuelans could also have considerable repercussions in a state with a large population of immigrants from the South American country, many of whom have been living in the U.S. for years and are deeply integrated in the local economy.",
      "\"It is ruining our economy,\" said Higgins. \"Sure, get the criminals out of here, but find a path to citizenship for people who deserve it and for an economy that needs it.\"",
      "Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.",
      "\"They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,\" he said. \"Why pick a fight about national immigration policy? Next, we are going to be talking about whether men should be in women's sports.\"",
      "Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground if she is elected, but warned, \"When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.\"",

      "Almost 5.4 million Americans have reported being victims of domestic violence over the last five years, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The majority, nearly 80%, were women. And according to the FBI, domestic homicides more than doubled between 2019 and 2024, increasing from 1,065 to 2,339. The latest data has experts worried.",
      "\"Domestic violence remains one of the most persistent public health and safety crises in our country,\" Nathaniel Fields, CEO of the nonprofit Urban Resource Institute, told CBS News.",
      "The issue is personal for Lisa DeSort, whose 20-year-old daughter Azsia Johnson was shot and killed in New York City in 2022. CBS News returned with her to the site where the shooting took place in October, which is also domestic violence awareness month.",
      "DeSort carried a bouquet of flowers that she placed at the tree that stands where Johnson's ex-boyfriend, Isaac Argro, allegedly shot her. Johnson had been hiding at local shelters in the months leading up to the shooting, according to DeSort, but she decided to allow him to meet their 3-month-old baby one night in June 2022.",
      "\"Intimate partner violence is one of the most common charges in the borough of Manhattan, in the city of New York and nationwide,\" said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who charged then-23-year-old Argro with Johnson's murder. He has pleaded not guilty, and the case could head to trial next year.  Bragg told CBS News his office is currently looking at more than 500 cases of intimate partner violence.",
      "What's known as \"intimate partner violence\" is a subset of the broader category of domestic violence, which refers to violence carried out by any member of the family. Local, state and federal agencies have differing definitions of what constitutes domestic violence.",
      "Intimate partner violence poses unique challenges to law enforcement and agencies that support victims, and the crime often goes unreported, according to experts who track it and organizations that provide support for victims of domestic violence.",
      "\"We talk about it when it's in the news, when some celebrity, some high-profile person, has committed domestic violence, but not when it affects everyday people,\" Fields said.",
      "As a society, he said, leaders need to identify what domestic violence is and increase awareness of warning signs, such as controlling behavior and escalating violence, because relationships can devolve into domestic violence quickly. URI runs programs for students as well as incarcerated people to do just that.",
      "\"What we learned in working with thousands of young people in high schools is that we started too late, so we had to work with people in junior high schools,\" Fields said.",
      "Despite the programming and public service announcements, the rate of domestic violence across the country has remained high. A CBS News analysis of FBI data found that 24% of all reported violent crime was domestic in nature. That's roughly the same rate as 2019, before the pandemic spurred a spike in violent crime, including homicides.",
      "Gladys Ricart was murdered by her ex-boyfriend 26 years ago as she was preparing to leave for the church to marry her new love. The shooting was captured on home video, and the image of her being shot in her wedding gown jarred her Dominican American community in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood.",
      "Her niece Lethy Liriano was one of her bridesmaids, and today is an activist who leads the annual Brides' March, where hundreds of women don wedding dresses and march in upper Manhattan to call out domestic violence.",
      "\"We can understand how serious and prevalent and damaging this is to our community,\" Liriano said to marchgoers through her megaphone at this year's Brides' March on Sept. 26.",
      "Speaking to CBS News at the march, Liriano said: \"By hearing each other's stories, we are understanding that none of us are at fault for not knowing a horrific violent event was going to come.\"",
      "In more than a dozen interviews with survivors of domestic violence, activists and experts, people said that domestic violence can become an intergenerational cycle.",
      "DeSort said she herself was a victim of domestic violence and recognized the warning signs in her daughter's boyfriend. She said he would look at her daughter's phone and arrive unannounced, demanding to know where she was. And when Johnson was six months pregnant, DeSort said, he beat her.",

      "New York \u2014 NBA star Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat pleaded not guilty to federal charges Monday, the last of the basketball players tied to alleged illegal-mafia linked gambling rings to appear before a judge in a Brooklyn federal courtroom.",
      "Rozier appeared before Magistrate Judge Clay H. Kaminsky on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors allege the conspiracies happened between December 2022 and March 2024.",
      "He was released on a $3 million bond secured by his home in Florida, and another property for which the court sealed the address. Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, asked the court during the arraignment for a speedy and public trial for his client.",
      "Rozier was arrested in Orlando on Oct. 23 during a sweeping FBI crackdown in which 34 defendants were snagged across two federal indictments. Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme which facilitated bets on NBA basketball games that allegedly took advantage of insider information related to injury reports.",
      "The NBA placed Rozier on indefinite leave after the arrest. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u00a0said\u00a0in public remarks following the arrests he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the allegations against several people associated with the league.",
      "Rozier and five other defendants are accused of providing nonpublic information in exchange for a flat fee or a cut of the profits. In one game in particular, prosecutors allege, Rozier told a co-conspirator that he would fake an injury in order to leave a game early.",
      "Federal investigators had been examining unusual betting activity over a Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans game on March 23, 2023. Rozier, who played for the Hornets before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024, played only 9 minutes and 34 seconds, leaving the game with right foot discomfort. At the time, the NBA said it found no evidence that Rozier violated league rules.",
      "Rozier is not charged in the other indictment, which focuses on an\u00a0elaborate cheating scheme\u00a0that allegedly netted more than $7 million from rigged poker games, prosecutors said.",
      "Rozier appeared in court Monday alongside co-defendant Deniro Laster. Prosecutors allege that Laster, a childhood friend of Rozier's, orchestrated the sharing of non-public information and bets between various gambling rings. Laster, who lives in Cleveland, was released on a $50,000 secured bond by his mother and cousin.",
      "Both defendants surrendered their passports, agreed to travel limitations, be tested for substances and not partake in gambling, among other bond conditions.",
      "Rozier's attorney said later in the day at a status conference that his client would appear before the NBA for arbitration in the next week and a half. He also confirmed Rozier is not currently getting paid his NBA salary, and said the federal case has caused great damage to him professionally.",

    "summary": "Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "story": [
      "A northern Virginia man was arrested and accused of placing two pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal authorities announced Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old from Woodbridge, Virginia, located just outside Washington, D.C. Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.",
      "Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.",
      "Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.",
      "An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.",
      "The court documents don't make any references to the Capitol riot that took place the following day. During Thursday's news conference, Bondi didn't provide details about the suspect's possible motive.",
      "\"Right now, it's ongoing,\" she said. \"Again, we just executed the search warrant early, early this morning. It's ongoing, but America's safer, D.C.'s safer because he's in custody.\"",
      "Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"",
      "\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.",
      "The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years.  The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.",
      "The devices \u2014 made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.",
      "The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.",
      "\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"",
      "Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.",
      "But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect \u2014 grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie \u2014 and offered $500,000 for information.",
      "In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"",

    "summary": "Archaeologists finished excavating foundations of the ancient wall that surrounded Jerusalem when the story of Hanukkah took place.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have finished uncovering the longest continuous remains of an ancient wall that encircled Jerusalem, including possible evidence of a 2,100-year-old ceasefire between warring kingdoms.",
      "Last week, archaeologists finished excavating the most complete part ever discovered of the foundations of the walls, which surrounded Jerusalem during the time of the Hasmonean Kingdom, when the story of Hanukkah took place. The discovery comes almost exactly one year after a rare collection of ancient coins was unearthed by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "In Hebrew, Hanukkah means \"dedication,\" and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C., after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces, and the Hasmonean Kingdom that followed.",
      "Jews celebrate the eight-day holiday, which this year begins on Dec. 14, with the ritual of lighting a nightly candle, in honor of the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple that lasted for eight nights instead of just one. Many also eat fried foods such as potato pancakes, called latkes, to memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil.",
      "The Hasmonean wall foundation, whose excavation was finished last week in Jerusalem, was likely built a few decades after the story of Hanukkah by the same rulers. It's almost 50 meters (164 feet) long, around half the length of a football field, and around 5 meters (16 feet) wide. It held walls, which according to estimations and some historical writings, were taller than the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City.",
      "Much of the current walls surrounding Jerusalem's Old City date back hundreds of years to the Ottoman Era.",
      "The Hasmonean walls encircled an area much larger than the current Old City of Jerusalem, with 60 watchtowers along the wall that were more than 10 meters (33 feet) tall, according to ancient writings. The part recently uncovered is one of the longest sections found intact from the foundation of the Hasmonean walls.",
      "Separation wall and ceasefire",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the foundation was that the wall above it seems to have been purposefully and uniformly dismantled to a uniform height, not chaotically destroyed by the ravages of time or war, said Dr. Amit Re'em, one of the lead archaeologists for the project from the Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "Experts wondered why any leader would take apart a perfectly good security wall in an area that was constantly threatened by invasion.",
      "In 132 or 133 B.C., Hellenistic King Antiochus the Seventh, an heir to the Antiochus the Fourth from the story of Hanukkah, laid siege to Jerusalem and the Judean Kingdom, according to ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.",
      "As the Judean army struggled, Jewish king John Hyrcanus I decided to strike a deal with Antiochus. He raided King David's tomb for 3,000 talents of silver and offered 500 hostages, including his own brother, according to the writings of Josephus.",
      "\"Antiochus Sidetes (the Seventh) reached a ceasefire agreement with John Hyrcanus, saying, if you want me to remove my army, you yourself, the Jewish king, must raze to the ground the Hasmonean fortification that you and your father built,\" Re'em said Monday. Josephus' writings state that after Antiochus accepted Hyrcanus' deal, they \"pulled down the walls encircling the city.\"",
      "Other sections of the Hasmonean wall uncovered in other parts of Jerusalem weren't dismantled, so it could have just been one section that was dismantled, possibly to provide a foundation for Herod's palace, Peleg-Barkat explained. Its unlikely that Jerusalem was left unprotected without any security walls for more than a century, she said.",
      "Wall under a prison",
      "The current section of the wall was uncovered underneath an abandoned wing of the building known as the Kishleh, which was built in 1830 as a military base. The wing was used as a prison, including by the British up until the 1940s, and the walls were covered with graffiti carved by prisoners in English, Hebrew and Arabic. The remnants of the iron bars of the cells are still visible in the ceiling.",
      "Most of the building is still used by the Israeli police today, but one wing was abandoned and later transferred to the Tower of David Museum. Archaeologists first began excavating this wing of the Kishleh in 1999, but violence in Jerusalem during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, halted the excavations until two years ago.",
      "Archaeologists removed the equivalent of two Olympic swimming pools worth of dirt and debris by hand over the past two years from the hall. The excavations revealed what they believe are Middle Age-era dye pits, likely for fabric dying, and the long section of the Hasmonean wall foundation.",
      "In the coming years, the Tower of David Museum will install a floating glass floor over the ruins and use the hall as one of its new galleries in the Schulich Wing of Archaeology, Art and Innovation. The renovations of this section are expected to take at least two years, now that the archaeological dig has concluded.",
      "Last year's \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle\"",
      "Almost exactly one year ago, in December 2024, Israeli researchers discovered a rare collection of ancient coins on the third day of Hanukkah, calling the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins were more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty. Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed on the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "More recently, last month, archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country.",

A Wednesday announcement from the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia said it regretted the action but the families of competitors were concerned about their safety.",
      "Trump says he'll \"make a phone call\" to stop the fighting",
      "The new, widespread fighting followed a skirmish Sunday that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed a ceasefire pushed by President Trump that had ended armed combat in July. Mr. Trump has repeatedly included the conflict among those he says he has ended.",
      "The five days of fighting over territorial disputes left dozens dead on both sides and forced the evacuation of thousands of civilians. The ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Mr. Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges from the two nations unless they agreed.",

      "Machado last appeared in public 11 months ago. Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken told public broadcaster NRK the Venezuelan opposition leader was not in the Norwegian capital on the day of the ceremony and her daughter will accept the prize on Machado's behalf.",
      "\"We confirm that she will not attend the Nobel ceremony, but we are optimistic about her presence on the rest of the day's agenda,\" said Machado's spokesperson, Claudia Macero. She did not give information on Machado's current location.",
      "Harpviken said just four days ago\u00a0that Machado confirmed to him that she would attend the ceremony, though he said at the time that, \"given the security situation, we cannot say more about the date or how she will arrive.\"",
      "Prominent Latin American figures planned to attend Wednesday's ceremony in a signal of solidarity with Machado, including Argentine President Javier Milei, Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Machado has been living in hiding and has not been seen in public since Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after joining supporters in a protest in Caracas, Venezuela's capital.",
      "The 58-year-old's win for her struggle to achieve a democratic transition in her South American nation was announced on Oct. 10, and she was described as a woman \"who keeps the flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness.\"",
      "Machado won an opposition primary election and intended to challenge President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's presidential election, but the government barred her from running for office. Retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez took her place.",
      "The lead-up to the July 28, 2024 election saw widespread repression, including disqualifications, arrests and human rights violations. That increased after the country's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared the incumbent the winner.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez sought asylum in Spain last year after a Venezuelan court issued a warrant for his arrest.",
      "U.N. human rights officials and many independent rights groups have expressed concerns about the situation in Venezuela, and called for Maduro to be held accountable for the crackdown on dissent.",
      "Five past Nobel Peace Prize laureates were detained or imprisoned at the time of the award, according to the prize's official website, most recently Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi in 2023 and Belarusian human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski in 2022.",
      "The others were Liu Xiaobo of China in 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar in 1991 and Carl von Ossietzky of Germany in 1935.",
      "\"There is a long tradition that when a Peace Prize laureate cannot be present, close family members represent them,\" Harpviken said. \"That happened with Narges Mohammadi, and with Ales Bialiatski; both were imprisoned at the time.

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 04:32:59 -0500",
    "summary": "At least three oil tankers have been hit by explosions in what appears to be a stepped up unilateral effort by Ukraine to sink Russia's sanctions-dodging oil sales.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine has struck at least two oil tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa in a campaign against Russia's so-called shadow fleet, months after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for Kyiv's partners to strengthen their response to the vessels that Moscow uses to evade international sanctions and continue selling its natural resources.",
      "Ukraine has previously targeted fuel tankers and infrastructure in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine the crucial source of Moscow's war funding, but the recent attacks have taken place outside Russia's territorial waters.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have sanctioned hundreds of ships in the shadow fleet, accusing them of violating bans on Russian oil sales, transporting stolen Ukrainian grain, and even suspected of spying on or damaging underwater telecommunications cables and pipelines.",
      "In October, Zelenskyy said Kyiv's intelligence service was providing information to European partners and \"expect that efforts to counter Russian interference will be significantly strengthened.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, the sanctioned crude oil tanker Kairos was grounded off the coast of NATO member Bulgaria after a Turkish tugboat that had been towing it from Turkey's exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea separated from the vessel in Bulgarian waters, according to state-owned Bulgarian news agency BTA.",
      "Kairos and another sanctioned oil tanker, the Virat, were both hit by Ukrainian \"Sea Baby\" drones in the Black Sea in separate attacks at the end of November, sources in the SBU told CBS News on Tuesday. The sources said the attacks were a joint operation between the 13th Main Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency and the Ukrainian Navy.",
      "\"The SBU continues to take active steps to curtail Russia's financial capabilities to wage war against Ukraine,\" an SBU source said. \"Sea Baby naval drones disabled ships that could transport oil worth almost $70 million and helped the Kremlin circumvent international sanctions.\"",
      "The SBU sources provided a video showing the moment the Sea Baby drones struck both ships. CBS News has confirmed the ships visible in the video matches publicly available photos of the Kairos and Virat. The SBU officials said both tankers were critically damaged and \"taken out of service\" by the strikes.",
      "Publicly available ship tracking data corroborated the BTA report suggesting the Turkish tug had separated from the tanker six miles from Bulgaria's coast. The Kairos was stranded on Tuesday off Ahtopol, on Bulgaria's southern Black Sea coast, without heat or electricity, according to BTA.",
      "The Bulgarian Navy airlifted several crew members to shore, but authorities had been unable to tow the oil tanker to safety as of Tuesday due to poor weather conditions.",
      "Late last month, the technical manager of another tanker, the Mersin, said the vessel was impacted by a series of explosions while anchored off the coast of Senegal. The crew was rescued, according to Senegalese officials, and the vessel's technical manager, Besiktas Shipping, said seawater flooded into the engine room but the ship remained \"safe\" and posed no safety or navigational risks.",
      "The Mersin remained stranded with some 30,000 tons of diesel fuel on board, however, according to the African Security Analysis think tank.",
      "The tanker departed from the Russian port of Taman on Aug. 21 and arrived in Senegal in late September, where it has remained at anchor, according to open-source data from MarineTraffic. While the Mersin is not currently among the vessels sanctioned by the U.S., ships operated by BesiktasShipping have engaged in highly risky ship-to-ship crude oil transfers while anchored, according to the sanctions compliance monitoring organization OpenSanctions.",
      "Video circulating on social media, dated Nov. 30, shows the Mersin sinking. CBS News has not confirmed the source of the video, but the oil tanker's partially-submerged name is visible in the clip, seemingly recorded from a passing vessel.",
      "Ukrainian officials have not publicly confirmed any involvement in any of the explosions in the Black Sea or off the coast of Africa, all of which occurred within a few days. On Dec. 3, Besiktas Shipping said it was immediately ceasing all \"Russia related voyages.\"",
      "While insisting that it always complied and complies with restrictions on Russian oil shipments, the company said \"the security situation in the region has escalated considerably,\" and \"we have concluded that the risks posed to our vessels and crew have become untenable.\"",
      "European nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on hundreds of vessels they say are part of the Russian shadow fleet, but a planned European Union-wide move to allow national authorities to board and inspect suspected ships has yet to materialize.",
      "Shadow fleet vessels have also been linked to drone sightings at European airports, including last week when unidentified drones breached Irish airspace during a visit from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The EU and America's European NATO allies have issued increasing warnings about Russia's alleged hybrid warfare tactics in recent months, including the drone airspace incursions and sabotage operations across the continent and at sea.",

    "story": [
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2013 Some Danes told CBS News on the streets of Copenhagen they are increasingly worried about their country's security because of what they see as the growing threat from nearby Russia and concerns over the reliability of the Trump White House as an ally.",
      "Kenneth Howery, the new U.S ambassador to Denmark, is in Greenland's capital Nuuk this week for his first trip to the Danish-controlled, but self-governed, country. He said in a social media post on X that he and officials from Greenland and Denmark \"renewed our commitment to a strong and mutually beneficial relationship\" while meeting on Monday.",
      "Their meeting came after U.S. and Danish diplomatic ties were strained by President Trump reviving his long-standing interest in acquiring Greenland, which the White House has argued is necessary to protect U.S. national security. Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out taking Greenland by military force even though Denmark is a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance.",
      "Hanne Mortenson, a Danish resident of the country's capital, told CBS News late last week that she has always looked to the United States as \"the ideal of democracy,\" but believes the country is becoming \"more and more autocratic.\" She said that is troubling due to Russia's repeated, recent incursions into European airspace.",
      "\"I saw this big map yesterday on TV with how much the Russians are coming closer and that worries me,\" Mortensen said, although she added that she wouldn't want the U.S. to take over Greenland despite security concerns related to Russia.",
      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "Denmark is consistently ranked as one of the world's happiest countries, according to the Global Happiness Index. But in recent weeks, European nations have reported unidentified drones flying around key infrastructure, including in Denmark, following Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Poland, Romania and Estonia. Some of the United States' European NATO allies have alleged airspace incursions are part of a campaign of escalating hybrid warfare tactics by Russia.",
      "In September, Copenhagen Airport was forced to suspend flights due to unidentified drone sightings. Russia, however, denied involvement in drone incursions, with its embassy in Denmark saying in a statement at the time that \"incidents involving reported disruptions at Danish airports are a staged provocation. Undoubtedly, they will be used as a pretext for further escalating tension in the interests of forces seeking by all means to prolong the Ukrainian conflict and extend it to other countries.\"",
      "Still, one 70-year-old Danish woman told CBS News that the Danish sense of security and contentment is waning.",
      "\"The Russians have to go through Denmark to come to Europe,\" she told CBS News. \"I think people my age are more worried because we remember \u2013 we are after World War II children \u2013 so, we remember those days, and we have heard about it our entire childhood, about the war and the difficulties and all the horror that goes with war.\"",
      "Copenhagen resident Thomas Geuken, said he was recently talking to his 90-year-old father-in-law, \"and I asked him this morning, 'Is the glass half empty or half full?' And he actually said, 'Well, it's half empty because of the war in Ukraine and Russia. So it plays a big part in our thinking.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that Ukraine will not give up any territory to Russia and said components of a plan to end the war between the countries are ready to be presented to the U.S.",
      "\"Russia is insisting that we give up territories, but we don't want to cede anything,\" Zelenskyy said in an online press conference Monday, the AFP news agency reported.",
      "\"We have no legal right to do so, under Ukrainian law, our constitution and international law. And we don't have any moral right either,\" Zelenskyy said after leaving London, where he met with the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany.",
      "Zelenskyy's remarks suggest he will not bend to pressure from Russian President Vladimir Putin or President Trump, whose negotiators had proposed Ukraine give up its eastern region of the Donbas \u2013 about 20% of the country's territory \u2013 as part of a plan to end Russia's war on Ukraine, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official. The Donbas region has mostly been taken over by Russia's army in its nearly four-year long invasion of Ukraine, and the Kremlin had agreed to this point in the White House-authored peace proposal.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine will share a revised peace plan with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We are working very actively on all components of possible steps to end the war,\" he said Tuesday on social media. \"The Ukrainian and European components have already been worked out more, and we are ready to present them to our partners in America. Together with the American side, we expect to make the possible steps as workable as possible as soon as possible.\"",
      "While he did not share details, the plan could be sent to Washington as early as Tuesday, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "Zelenskyy held talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and French President Emmanuel Macron in London on Monday, as talks over the U.S.-proposed peace initiative have stagnated. The idea that Ukraine must give up the Donbas region is a key sticking point in the U.S. plan, which Trump administration officials offered in November as a 28-point proposal.",
      "Zelenskyy said he would be willing to travel to the United States for more talks with President Trump, who said in an interview with Politico on Monday that Ukraine has to \"play ball.\" Mr. Trump said Russia has the \"upper hand\" in the conflict, adding, \"they always did. They're much bigger.\"",
      "He also blasted European leaders over their handling of Ukraine",
      "\"They're not doing a good job,\" Mr. Trump told the outlet. \"Europe is not doing a good job in many ways. They're not doing a good job. They talk too much. And they're not producing. They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"",

    "story": [
      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",

    "summary": "Officials said the megaquake advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%, but there's hope it will serve as a wake-up call.",
    "story": [
      "Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the northern part of the country, causing 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings. The government has estimated that an offshore megaquake could cause a tsunami of up to 98 feet and kill nearly 200,000 people.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there's hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude 8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \"Nankai Trough\" megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "Japan megaquake advisory follows powerful earthquake",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency said Monday's powerful earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido.",
      "Daiki Shimohata, 33, a civil servant in Hashikami on Honshu island, told Agence France-Presse that he and his family rushed outside their home.",
      "\"The tremor was something that we've never experienced. It lasted maybe for about 20 seconds,\" Shimohata said by phone.",
      "\"We were holding our children \u2014 a 2-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy \u2014 in our arms. The shaking reminded me of the disaster (in 2011),\" he said.",
      "The quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 50 feet in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Megaquake could cause 98-foot tsunami and kill nearly 200,000",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 98-foot tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba Prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",
      "In a 2013 damage estimate for a possible Nankai Trough megaquake, the government said a magnitude 9.1 quake could generate a tsunami exceeding 33 feet within minutes, killing as many as 323,000 people, destroying more than 2 million buildings and causing economic damage exceeding 200 trillion yen ($1.28 trillion) in the region.",
      "Officials call on people to be calm and prepared",
      "Officials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.",
      "Officials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets. People in the region are also advised to discuss evacuation procedures with family members and sleep in day clothes, not in pajamas, so they can flee immediately. Furniture should also be fixed to the floor or the wall.",
      "The designated municipalities explained the advisory on their websites and started inspecting stocks of relief goods and equipment to be used at evacuation centers.",
      "Iwaki City in Fukushima urged residents to register for emergency emails, while officials in the town of Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, inspected wireless communication devices.",
      "Japan's first megaquake advisory in August of last year contained a lot of scientific jargon. It worried and baffled many across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled annual events, disappointing many travelers during Japan's Buddhist holidays.",
      "Many people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and portable toilets, leaving shelves empty at many supermarkets in western Japan and even Tokyo, which is outside of the at-risk area.",

      "Four young men were detained by Afghanistan's Taliban authorities and put into a rehabilitation program for walking around in public dressed up as their favorite characters from the hit British drama \"Peaky Blinders.\"",
      "The Taliban government's Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said the four friends \u2014   who had become popular in their local Jibrail township, in the southern province of Herat, for strutting through the streets in trench coats and flat caps \u2014 were detained for \"promoting foreign culture.\"",
      "The men, all in their early 20s, were detained in Jibrail, according to Saif-ur-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the government ministry.",
      "\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat, arrested, and a rehabilitation program started for them,\" Khyber\u00a0said Sunday in a post\u00a0on one of his social media accounts. \"Praise be to Allah, we are Muslims and Afghans; we have our own religion, culture, and values. Through numerous sacrifices, we have protected this country from the spread of harmful cultures, and now we are also defending it.\"",
      "Speaking with CBS News on Tuesday, however, Khyber said the men were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released.\"",
      "\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" Khyber told CBS News on Tuesday. \"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"",
      "The friends, Asghar Husinai, Jalil Yaqoobi, Ashore Akbari and Daud Rasa, who appeared recently on a local YouTuber's chat show, were often seen walking around in outfits modeled on the Netflix hit series' Shelby family.",
      "Video and photos of them walking shoulder to shoulder in their costumes had circulated widely on social media in Afghanistan in the days before their arrests.",
      "In the group interview posted online at the end of November by local YouTube channel Hirat Mic, the young men said they admired the show's fashion and had received overwhelmingly positive reactions from locals.",
      "\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" Yaqoobi said. \"Some comments were negative, but we only paid attention to the appreciation.\"",
      "Afghanistan's Taliban authorities, however, deemed the outfits \"contrary to Islamic values and Afghan culture.\"",
      "A video released by the ministry and shared by Khyber along with his statement includes audio said to be one of the young men expressing regret for his decision to wear the Western clothing.",
      "\"I'm on Instagram and have five million followers. Without realizing it, I used to publish and spread things that were against Sharia,\" says the voice in the audio recording, which is identified by the ministry only as one of the young men, not by name. \"I was summoned and advised, and from today onward I will no longer engage in such sinful activities \u2014 and I have stopped.\"",
      "A close friend of the four young men told CBS News their detention was \"ridiculous.\"",
      "\"The country always feels like a prison,\" said the friend, whom CBS News is not identifying for safety reasons. \"Our friends wore these outfits for no political or other reason \u2014 just for fun \u2014 and the Taliban's religious police detained them ... They admired the British series and wanted to share that admiration, but it turned into a nightmare. They are now behind bars.\"",
      "The detentions come amid a crackdown by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban authorities to enforce strict dress codes and other societal rules for men, women and children. Women and girls have seen their rights curbed most dramatically, being barred from virtually all work and formal education after the age of 11.",
      "The Taliban retook control of the country after two decades of Western-backed governance in the summer of 2021, as the U.S. military withdrew under an agreement reached between the Taliban and the U.S. during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "The vice and virtue ministry's crackdown on all behavior deemed un-Islamic under the country's strict interpretation of Sharia law has been far-reaching.",
      "In a social media post on Tuesday, spokesman Khyber said two street magicians were arrested in the Balkh province for engaging \"in activities contrary to Islamic Sharia law for a long time.\"",
      "\"Books and documents related to witchcraft were obtained from the aforementioned individuals, which, based on initial information, have played a role in family disputes, separation between spouses, and the formation of some social problems among the residents of this province,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week.",
      "Monday's quake struck northeast of the Aomori town of Hachinohe, and about 30 miles below the sea surface, the agency said. Hachinohe residents fled their homes to seek shelter in city hall, public broadcaster NHK said.",
      "A reporter for NHK in Hokkaido described a horizontal shaking of around 30 seconds that made him unable to keep standing as the earthquake struck. The quake was also felt in the northern hub of Sapporo, where alarms rang on smartphones to alert residents.",
      "The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously. Most of the victims were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole.",
      "Nuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks, Kihara said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said about 118 gallons of water spilled from a spent fuel cooling area at the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, but that its water level remained within the normal range and there was no safety concern.",
      "Kihara said about 800 homes were without electricity, and that the Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region.",
      "About 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe Air Base, and 18 defense helicopters were mobilized for damage assessment, Defense Minister Shinjir\u014d Koizumi said.",
      "About 200 passengers were stranded for the night at New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, NHK reported.",
      "\"I've never experienced such a big shaking,\" convenience store owner Nobuo Yamada told NHK in Hachinohe, adding that \"luckily\" power lines were still operating in his area.",
      "Satoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.",
      "Kato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation center, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.",
      "The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami danger for the U.S. West Coast, Canada's British Columbia or Alaska.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, in brief comments to reporters, said the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage. \"We are putting people's lives first and doing everything we can,\" she said.",
      "Later, she urged residents in the region to pay attention to the latest information from local municipalities: \"Please be prepared so you can immediately evacuate as soon as you feel a tremor.\"",
      "Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.",
      "The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year.",
      "The vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and depth below the Earth's surface."

    "story": [
      "Underwater archaeologists announced Monday they had discovered the 2,000-year-old wreck of an ancient Egyptian pleasure boat off the coast of Alexandria.",
      "Divers found the vessel's hull, which was more than 115 feet long and about 23 feet wide, submerged in the port of the island of Antirhodos, the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM)\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "There was Greek graffiti on the vessel that \"could date from the first half of the first century AD\" and \"supports the hypothesis that the ship was built in Alexandria.\"",
      "The boat \"would have had a luxuriously decorated cabin and appears to have been propelled solely by oars,\" the Alexandria-based institute added.",
      "Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria in 331 BC. A series of earthquakes and tidal waves that struck its coast submerged the island of Antirhodos, which was discovered in 1996.",
      "Over the years, divers have recovered statues, coins and other treasures there, with some on display at the Greco-Roman Museum in Alexandria.",
      "IEASM director Franck Goddio recently published a report on Antirhodos and its Temple of Isis, based on underwater exploration carried out since the 1990s.",
      "\"It's extremely exciting because it's the first time ever that such a boat has been discovered in Egypt,\" Goddio told the Guardian of the latest discovery. \"Those boats were mentioned by different ancient authors, like Strabo, and they were also represented in some iconography \u2013 for example, in the Palestrina mosaic, where you see such a boat of a much smaller size with noblemen hunting hippopotamuses. But [an actual boat] has never been discovered before.\"",
      "Future research on the recently discovered wreck \"promises to be a fascinating journey into the life, religion, wealth and waterway pleasures of ancient Roman Egypt,\" the institute said.",
      "Alexandria is home to ancient ruins and historic treasures, but Egypt's second-largest city is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels, sinking by more than three millimeters every year.",
      "Even in the United Nations' best-case scenario, a third of Alexandria will be underwater or uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "Multiple shipwrecks have been found in the bay, including the wreckage of Napoleon's fleet from the\u00a01798 Battle of the Nile. Earlier this year, a well-preserved boat measuring about 20 feet long was discovered by IEASM in the eastern harbor of Alexandria, according to a podcast posted by the\u00a0Hilti Foundation.",
      "In August, archaeologists announced that ancient statues, Roman coins and other artifacts from Alexandria were pulled from the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Authorities said that the site may be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, and the Roman Empire, which governed for around 600 years.",
      "The announcement of the pleasure boat discovery comes just days after archaeologists revealed that 225 funerary figurines were found inside a tomb in the ancient Egyptian capital of Tanis in the Nile Delta.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's president was likely to look for a strong show of support from his European partners on Monday after being admonished by President Trump, who accused him of not reading a White House-authored proposal to end Russia's ongoing war on his country.",
      "Speaking Sunday evening to reporters on the red carpet before the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, Mr. Trump said he was disappointed in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's response to the plan to end the nearly-four-year Russian invasion, while claiming Russia had backed the proposal.",
      "\"I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago,\" Mr. Trump said, adding: \"His people love it. But he hasn't \u2014 Russia's fine with it. Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it.\"",
      "Zelenskyy has not made any public comments about Mr. Trump's remarks. CBS News has reached out to Zelenskyy's team for comment.",
      "That assessment by Mr. Trump came despite a top Kremlin official telling journalists after talks last week in Moscow, between senior White House envoys and Vladimir Putin and his top aides, that they were, \"no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff then held meetings over the weekend in Florida with Ukrainian representatives. They said in a joint statement that \"both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday just hours before Zelenskyy met in London with the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany.",
      "The show of European unity was expected to see Zelenskyy continue his delicate diplomatic tightrope walk. He is embracing continued negotiations as he tries to keep Mr. Trump on his side and maintain critical U.S. intelligence and military support. He is also resisting White House pressure to accept a ceasefire deal that both Zelenskyy and his European backers say favors Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy previously said \"the main problem\" with the proposal was that it would legally recognize \"stolen\" territory occupied by Russian forces during the invasion, which European leaders have warned would set a dangerous precedent.",
      "Ukraine's leader will be keen to show he still has strong, unanimous backing from his European partners as negotiations continue over the still-ambiguous details of the U.S-brokered proposal.",
      "In addition to the impasse over Ukraine agreeing to formally cede territory to Russia, other sticking points in the talks include measures to ensure that Ukraine's security is guaranteed in the future, because of concerns Russia could try to invade again.",
      "The priorities for Ukraine and its European backers \u2014 to effectively undermine any ceasefire deal that Russia would legitimately be able to call a victory \u2014 appear to be at odds with some very basic tenets of White House policy, meanwhile.",
      "On Friday, the Trump administration published a broad new National Security Strategy document stating, among other things, that the U.S. wants to improve relations with Moscow.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the document spelling out the Trump administration's core foreign policy objectives \"absolutely corresponds to our vision.\"",
      "Russia has sought for years to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its NATO allies, and particularly between Washington and Ukraine's main backers on the continent.",
      "\"If we read closely the part about Ukraine, we can understand why Moscow shares this vision,\" European Council President Antonio Costa said Monday. \"The objective in this strategy is not a fair and durable peace. It's only [about] the end of hostilities [in Ukraine] and the stability of relations with Russia.\"",
      "\"Everyone wants stable relations with Russia,\" Costa added, but \"we can't have stable relations with Russia when Russia remains a threat to our security.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 7 tons of cocaine was seized from boats in the Caribbean in recent days, Colombia's navy said, as the U.S. continues to conduct lethal strikes on alleged drug-ferrying vessels in the region.",
      "Authorities confiscated about 7.1 tons of cocaine during two operations in the Caribbean, the country's navy said in a social media post on Wednesday. One interdiction took place 90 nautical miles from Barranquilla, a city on Colombia's northern coast, and the other one occurred about 70 miles south of that in the Gulf of Morrosquillo.",
      "The cocaine was valued at more than $340 million and 11 people \u2014 eight Colombians, two Venezuelans and one Jamaican \u2014 were arrested \"without affecting their integrity or their lives,\" the navy said in a separate statement.",
      "Authorities released images of the operations, showing photos of the boats involved as well as bricks of the alleged narcotics displayed on the ground next to officers and the detained suspects.",
      "The seizures come as Colombian President Gustavo Petro is calling on the U.S. to end strikes in the region against apparent drug-carrying vessels. The U.S. announced another strike Thursday in the Pacific Ocean that the Pentagon said killed four people.",
      "Since September, the U.S. military has launched at least 22 strikes on vessels in the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean that the Trump administration claims, without providing more evidence, are trafficking drugs. At least 87 people have been killed in the strikes so far.",
      "The latest strike comes as Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny in the wake of a recent Washington Post report\u00a0over a Sept. 2 boat strike\u00a0in the Caribbean\u00a0that killed 11 people. The report claimed the U.S. military struck the boat with two missiles, a revelation that the White House confirmed.\u00a0A source familiar with the matter\u00a0told CBS News on Wednesday that the second strike came as two people who survived the first missile were trying to climb back onto the boat. The survivors were allegedly trying to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. Some lawmakers have questioned whether the second strike constitutes a war crime.",
      "In an exclusive conversation with CBS News in October, Petro said some of those killed in the U.S. strikes have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "The White House denies those accusations, and President Trump has defended the strikes as a legitimate part of his fight against drug trafficking gangs.",
      "Earlier this week, the family of a\u00a0Colombian man who was killed in a U.S. military strike\u00a0on a boat in the Caribbean lodged a complaint against the U.S. with a human rights watchdog, arguing his death was an extrajudicial killing.",

      "2. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)",
      "This blood test is commonly performed yearly, according to Caamano, especially for men using TRT.",
      "\"This blood test measures metabolic and organ function, giving information about the kidneys and liver, and electrolyte and glucose state,\" she said. \"It is important to catch any organ issue that can pop up on its own, or that can be age- or medication-induced.\"",

      "Major health organizations \u2014 including the ACC, AHA, Endocrine Society and USPSTF \u2014 regard advanced lipid profiles as optional decision-support tools rather than standard screening tests.",
      "6. Thyroid function",
      "This blood test can be done yearly to evaluate how well your thyroid gland is functioning, according to Caamano.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "MEN MAY NEED TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS WOMEN TO PREVENT POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASE",
      "The test measures levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland and tells the thyroid how much hormone to produce. It also measures levels of free T4 (the main hormone the thyroid releases) and free T3 (the active form that the body converts T4 into).",
      "Based on these three levels, a doctor can determine whether the thyroid is underactive or overactive.",
      "\"Issues with thyroid function can lead to mood changes, fatigue, weight changes, palpitations and hair loss,\" one doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems. (iStock)",
      "Poor insulin sensitivity is closely tied to fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and vascular problems, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Detecting it early allows men to make changes that protect long-term organ health, including the brain,\" Liff said. \"Depending on the initial findings, a repeat every six months may be appropriate.\"",
      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",
      "\"These are done when men are having symptoms such as low libido, fatigue, breast enlargement or when they are using TRT,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",
      "10. Omega-3 index",

      "Low omega-3 levels, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a range of medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, poor cognition, mood disorders and more, studies have shown.",
      "Omega-3 fatty acids, or fish oil, \"were associated with significant reductions in heart attacks,\" the researchers found. (iStock)",

      "President Donald Trump was in Pennsylvania Tuesday night touting his administration's economic success, after Democrats swept a series of elections in 2025 while mainly campaigning on platforms focused on \"affordability.\"",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" Trump told the crowd in attendance at a casino resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, whom he spoke to for nearly two hours. \"Lower prices, bigger paychecks \u2013 you're getting lower prices, bigger paychecks, we're getting inflation \u2013 we're crushing it \u2013 and you're getting much higher wages. The only thing that is really going up big \u2013 it's called the stock market and your 401ks.\"",
      "Affordability has become a flashpoint heading into the midterms, with Republicans now fine-tuning their messaging on the economy after a slew of Democrats won elections in 2025 running on a platform focused on lowering costs. Prior to Tuesday night's address in Pennsylvania, Trump told Politico in an interview that he would give his economy an \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus\" grade, but a November Fox News national survey found that some 76% of voters reported they view the economy negatively, up from the 67% who reported the same in July, and up from the 70% who said the same at the end of former President Joe Biden's term.",

According to Trump, real wages \"plummeted\" by $3,000 under Biden, while under Trump's second administration, the president said, the typical factory worker has seen their real wages increase by $1,300, construction workers by over $1,800 and miners by $3,300. Trump added that, under Biden, real wages for construction workers dropped by $3,500.",
      "To put things into perspective for the audience, Trump also touched on the price of everyday goods and shared charts with the audience showing how the prices differed under his predecessor's term. Citing a report from Walmart, Trump said the cost of a full Thanksgiving meal, trimmings, turkey and all, is 25% cheaper under his administration than it was under Biden. He said the price of Thanksgiving turkeys specifically was also down 33%.",

      "In 1916, the government spent an average of $208.36 per person in today's dollars, according to Open The Books. Since then, the fiscal watchdog group says the trend line has gone up \"almost uninterrupted\" and the current per capita spending by the federal government sits at $20,474.19.",

      "Open The Books also notes that, according to national averages for how much people spend annually on their mortgages and groceries, the government's per capita spending eclipses the average spending on these two basic needs.

Ultimately, DOGE's cuts were but a drop in the bucket compared to how much the government forks over each year in mandatory spending for programs like Medicare and Social Security, Open The Books found.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., announced Tuesday that Republicans had coalesced around a proposal from Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who chairs the Senate health panel, and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, to counter Democrats' legislation.",

      "Cassidy and Crapo's plan was given the thumbs up by the majority of Republicans during the conference's closed-door meeting Tuesday afternoon, Thune said.",
      "Their proposal, which was unveiled Monday night but has been in the works for weeks, would abandon the enhanced premium subsidies in favor of health savings accounts (HSAs), funneling the money that has gone directly to insurers through the program to consumers instead.",
      "Thune argued that Senate Democrats' plan, which was unveiled by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last week and would extend the subsidies for three years, would do little to curb the cost of healthcare in the country, and instead benefit affluent Americans and insurance companies.",

      "The Senate Democrats' plan was unveiled by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last week. (Tom Brenner/Getty Images)",

But we will have an alternative that we will put up that reflects the views of the Republicans here in the United States Senate about how to make health insurance more affordable in this country, how to ensure that it's not the insurance companies that are getting enriched, that it's actually benefiting the patient.\"",
      "Republicans' decision comes as more and more proposals were pitched among their ranks, reaching nearly half a dozen plans on the table for lawmakers to choose from.",
      "Cassidy and Crapo\u2019s plan would seed HSAs with $1,000 for people ages 18 to 49 and $1,500 for those 50 to 65 for people earning up to 700% of the poverty level. In order to get the pre-funded HSA, people would have to buy a bronze or catastrophic plan on an Obamacare exchange.",

      "The bill also includes provisions reducing federal Medicaid funding to states that cover illegal immigrants, requirements that states verify citizenship or eligible immigration status before someone can get Medicaid, a ban on federal Medicaid funding for gender transition services and nixing those services from \"essential health benefits\" for ACA exchange plans, and inclusion of Hyde Amendment provisions to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortions through the new HSAs.",
      "Both plans are likely to fail, however, given that Senate Democrats have rejected doing away with the subsidies in favor of HSAs, and Republicans contend that reforms to the credits \u2014 like income caps and more stringent enforcement on taxpayer dollars funding abortions \u2014 are must-haves for their support.\u00a0Schumer argued that the \"only realist path\" to preventing premiums from hiking ahead of the end of the year deadline to extend the subsidies would be for Republicans to cross the aisle and vote for their plan. He charged that the GOP's plan was a \"phony proposal\" that did nothing to extend the sunsetting subsidies.",
      "\"That's what's driving the price up, and they're doing nothing about it,\" Schumer said. \"The bill not only fails to extend the tax credits, it increases costs, adds tons of new abortion restrictions for women, expands junk fees, and permanently funds the cost-sharing reductions. Their bill is junk insurance. It's been repudiated in the past.\"",

For some, the debate has devolved into a finger-pointing contest on which side was actually serious about addressing the growing healthcare affordability issue.",
      "\"It's not a realistic plan that the Democrats have,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said. \"If the Democrats were actually coming to the table, I'd say, yes, we need to, but what they're doing isn't realistic.\"",
      "Before Thune's announcement, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said that Republicans were in charge, not Democrats.",

That is the most important thing.\"",

It's difficult to build new buildings because of all the regulations, and even though we're sitting on masses of oil and gas, fracking is banned, so our energy prices are high, and it's not surprising that that makes us uncompetitive.\"",

      "Scam emails posing as MetaMask alerts are tricking users into revealing their crypto wallet details. (Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What is MetaMask and why scammers love it",
      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",
      "In this case, the presence of a Zendesk-style address does not make the message safe because the link still leads away from MetaMask's official website and asks you to react to manufactured urgency.",

      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts.

      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",

      "2) Auto-join networks",
      "Your phone remembers Wi-Fi networks you've connected to before, like stores, gyms, hotels, airports or even an old home router and reconnects automatically whenever it detects them again. The problem is that scammers can create look-alike networks with the same name, tricking your phone into joining without you noticing.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control. Your phone could quietly connect to networks you no longer trust or to fake hotspots designed to steal logins, read unencrypted traffic or inject malicious content. Turning off auto-join for places you don't use often keeps you safer from these silent, high-risk connections.",
      "Examples:",

      "Background permissions let apps run quietly behind the scenes and may use data or track location if not adjusted. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",
      "Examples:",
      "Bank fraud alertsWeather warningsSale notifications from a shopping appGames trying to get you to come back",

      "4) Security updates",
      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",
      "Examples:Patches that fix a flaw in your browserUpdates that stop malware from workingProtection against new phishing techniques",

      "5) App Refresh (also known as Background App Refresh)",
      "This is when apps update their content even when you're not using them, refreshing news, updating emails, pulling in notifications or syncing data. It keeps apps \"fresh,\" but also drains more battery and uses more mobile data.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0 Background App Refresh can quietly drain your battery, use mobile data and let apps run more often than they need to. Limiting it gives you more control over what apps do behind the scenes and reduces unnecessary tracking, resource use and surprise data charges.",
      "Examples:",

      "\"I was recently notified by two different banking institutions that someone completed an online application to open a deposit account in my name. Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",
      "Why would banking institutions not capture or share information about declined online applications? As far as I know, the credit bureaus do not collect information about deposit accounts and Early Warning Services only has information from banks that voluntarily report to them. So, how do I respond or react to someone trying to open deposit accounts in my name?

      "Why criminals open deposit accounts",
      "Criminals use deposit accounts for several strategic reasons that help them test stolen data and prepare bigger attacks.",

      "Deposit account fraud often falls outside normal credit monitoring. A service that looks at bank accounts and dark web activity adds extra protection. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if they cannot share details, ask them to document the attempt on your record. This helps flag future fraud attempts.",
      "Look for debit cards, 1099 forms or bank statements you did not request. Those often reveal when criminals succeed somewhere else.",
      "Next steps",

    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",
      "Short regular check-ins work better than one long conversation. Keep the tone open and supportive.",

      "Elite universities like Harvard, Princeton and Columbia spend fortunes on research, talent and digital infrastructure. Even then, they've become easy targets for attackers who see massive databases filled with personal information and donation records as a goldmine. Over the past few months, breaches across Ivy League campuses have exposed the same problem. These institutions handle huge amounts of sensitive data, but their internal defenses often don't match the scale of what they store. That pattern brings us to Harvard's newest incident, which exposed a database of alumni, donors, some students and faculty to hackers.",

      "Elite universities hold massive troves of personal and financial data that make them irresistible targets for attackers. (Photo by Aaron M. Sprecher/Getty Images)",
      "A phone phishing attack unlocks Harvard's data",
      "Harvard confirmed that a database tied to alumni, donors, faculty and some students was accessed by an unauthorized party. This happened after a phone phishing attack tricked someone into giving the attacker a way into the system.",
      "\"On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Harvard University discovered that information systems used by Alumni Affairs and Development were accessed by an unauthorized party as a result of a phone-based phishing attack,\" the university said in a notification posted on its website. \"The University acted immediately to remove the attacker's access to our systems and prevent further unauthorized access.\"",
      "The exposed data includes personal contact details, donation histories and other records tied to the university's fundraising and alumni operations. For Harvard, a school that routinely raises more than a billion dollars a year, this database is one of its most valuable assets, which makes the breach even more serious.",
      "This is also the second time Harvard has had to investigate a breach in recent months. In October, it looked into reports that its data was caught up in a broader hacking campaign targeting Oracle customers. That earlier warning already showed that the school sits in a high-risk category. This latest breach only confirms it.",

      "Ivy League schools are in a growing crisis",
      "Harvard isn't alone here. Ivy League campuses have seen a wave of incidents that line up almost back-to-back. Princeton reported on Nov. 15 that one of its databases tied to alumni, donors, students and community members was compromised.",
      "The University of Pennsylvania said on Oct. 31 that information systems connected to its development and alumni activities were accessed without permission. Columbia has been dealing with an even larger fallout. A breach in June exposed the personal data of roughly 870,000 people, including students and applicants.",
      "These attacks show how universities have become predictable targets. They store identities, addresses, financial records and donor information. They also run sprawling IT systems where a single mistake, a weak password or a convincing phone call can create an entry point.",
      "Hackers know this, and they strike repeatedly. The recent cluster of Ivy League breaches suggests that attackers are mapping these environments, looking for shared weaknesses that appear again and again.",

      "You can't stop a university or company from being breached, but you can make sure that your own information is harder to exploit. These steps help you reduce the fallout when your data ends up in the wrong hands.",
      "Using 2FA gives your accounts an extra layer of security. Even if someone steals your password in a breach, they still need the one-time code from your phone or authentication app. It blocks most casual attempts and forces attackers to work much harder.",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every site you use. This keeps one compromised password from unlocking everything else. It also removes the stress of remembering dozens of logins, so you don't cut corners.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "You can request takedowns from data broker sites, delete old accounts and trim what you share publicly. When your information isn't scattered across the internet, attackers have a much harder time piecing together your identity.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Many attackers rely on old flaws in operating systems, browsers and apps. Regular updates patch these holes and shut down the most common attack paths. If you're someone who delays updates, turning on automatic updates helps.",
      "Use alias email addresses for banking, education, shopping and newsletters. If one of them gets exposed, it won't automatically give attackers a map of your entire digital life. It makes targeted scams much harder to pull off, and also stops attackers from stealing your identity. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "You might also want to consider an identity theft protection service to be on the safe side. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Harvard's latest breach adds to a growing list of cyberattacks that show how vulnerable top universities have become. Even the most well-funded institutions aren't keeping pace with modern threats. When a simple phone phishing call can open the door to sensitive data tied to donors, alumni and students, it's clear that these campuses need stronger defenses and more proactive monitoring. Until that happens, you can expect more headlines like this and more investigations after the damage is already done.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Air taxis keep gaining momentum, yet one challenge keeps resurfacing: many cities have few places for them to land. AutoFlight believes it has an answer. The company introduced a zero-carbon water vertiport that moves across rivers, lakes or coastal zones. This solar-powered platform works as a mobile hub for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and aims to remove one of the biggest barriers to growth.",

      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "AutoFlight\u2019s solar-powered water vertiport shows how air taxis could finally gain flexible landing spots. (AutoFlight)",
      "The landing bottleneck that held air taxis back",
      "eVTOL air taxis promise quick trips that jump over traffic and turn long drives into short flights. That idea first appeared in the 1940s and '50s, when helicopter passenger services launched in the U.S. and Britain. Those early attempts faded because they could land in only a handful of places. Rooftops and scattered piers created new congestion points. Without enough landing pads, the entire system stalled.",
      "AutoFlight's new floating vertiport flips the model. Instead of forcing cities to build fixed sites that take years to complete, the vertiport travels to the aircraft.",
      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "The mobile platform supports fast charging and takeoffs for several eVTOL aircraft in real-world conditions. (AutoFlight)",
      "Inside the zero-carbon water vertiport",
      "The vertiport sits on a self-propelled barge with a deck lined with solar panels. It uses clean energy to charge eVTOLs without relying on grid power. A small cabin serves as a departure lounge and technical room. Operators can reposition the platform wherever demand rises, which gives cities far more flexibility.",
      "It works with several AutoFlight aircraft. That includes the six-seat Prosperity passenger craft and the White Shark and CarryAll vehicles used for cargo and industrial tasks. All can land, recharge and take off from the same floating hub.",
      "Because the platform runs on solar power and needs no major construction, it can be deployed much faster than any land-based site.",
      "First public demo on the water",
      "AutoFlight showed the full system on Nov. 22 at Dianshan Lake near Shanghai. A 2-ton-class eVTOL took off from the floating vertiport during a public test. The company also flew three aircraft in formation and completed live airdrop missions with supplies and life rafts. The event highlighted how the system supports emergency work and low-altitude logistics.",
      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "The system highlights how floating hubs may expand air mobility across commuting, emergency work and tourism.\u00a0 (AutoFlight)",
      "Five sectors this system could reshape",
      "This new platform supports a wide range of real-world uses that reach far beyond simple city travel.",
      "Offshore wind sites and oil rigs often wait hours for parts or personnel. AutoFlight says the system could improve transport efficiency more than tenfold.",
      "Teams can pair wide-area searches with fast aerial response. This cuts reaction time by over half and boosts survival odds.",
      "Cities along rivers and bays could build quick air routes without touching roads.",
      "Tour operators could add a \"flight plus water\" experience to premium trips.",
      "Multiple floating hubs can link into a network during peak travel or disaster relief missions.",
      "How AutoFlight pushes clean air mobility",
      "Sustainable aviation keeps gaining importance. AutoFlight partnered with CATL to integrate high-safety batteries into both its aircraft and vertiports. The system uses clean energy and low-impact infrastructure. It taps underused water surfaces and avoids major construction. Cities can deploy these pads quickly, which helps air mobility grow sooner.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air taxis may feel far off, yet this solution tackles a real problem. Landing and charging sites remain the missing link. Floating vertiports open the door to fast routes between airports and city centers. They also set the stage for quick regional hops that cut travel times and reduce stress. Tourism operators may even use them to launch new water-to-air experiences.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

      "FORMER GOOGLE CEO WARNS AI SYSTEMS CAN BE HACKED TO BECOME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WEAPONS",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Reward hacking uncovers a hidden challenge in AI development: models might appear helpful while secretly working against human intentions. Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",
      "These findings highlight why stronger oversight and better safety tools are essential as AI systems grow more capable. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Scammers use realistic emails during the holiday rush, so even normal inbox alerts can hide dangerous threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the FBI is raising the alarm",
      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center notes that Americans lose more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams during the holiday cycle and the months that follow. Credit card fraud pushed losses higher by another $199 million. Complaints usually surge in the early months of the year, which the IC3 ties to holiday activity that happens in November and December.",
      "The agency highlights four major schemes that spike during the season. They include non-delivery scams, where you pay for items that never arrive; non-payment scams, where sellers get nothing after shipping items; auction fraud, where the product is not what the listing claimed; and gift card fraud, where criminals push victims to pay with prepaid cards.",

      "The agency is also tracking a sharp rise in account takeover attacks. Since January 2025, IC3 has received more than 5,100 complaints tied to these scams with reported losses of over $262 million.",
      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results. Once a victim enters their information, scammers log in, lock out the real owner and move money. Many transfers go through cryptocurrency wallets to hide the trail.",
      "Criminals design phishing messages to look urgent, pushing people to act fast and give up sensitive information. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from holiday email scams",
      "You can lower your risk with a few simple habits.",
      "Avoid opening links or files in emails, websites or social media posts you did not expect. Also, use strong antivirus software to catch malware if you accidentally click on something unsafe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If a message asks you to update your password or account information, find the company's phone number yourself and call to verify it.",
      "Scammers create a sense of urgency. Slow down and confirm what you are being told.",
      "Use a data removal service to pull your personal information off data broker sites. These services scan dozens of brokers that publish your phone number, home address, email and even shopping habits. When less of your data is exposed, scammers have fewer details to use when crafting convincing phishing emails or impersonating trusted companies. This makes it harder for criminals to target you with personalized attacks during the holiday shopping rush.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), avoid reusing passwords and update your passwords as soon as you hear about a new scam or data leak that could affect you. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Create alias email addresses for shopping and sign-ups. These aliases forward messages to your primary inbox and help reduce spam. They also limit how much of your real information scammers can access if a retailer or website faces a breach.",
      "The FBI says victims should contact their financial institutions as soon as they notice fraud. Request a recall or reversal and ask for a hold harmless letter or letter of indemnity. Then reset every credential connected to the exposed password, including any account that uses the same login.",

      "Bradley J. Nelson, an author of the paper in Science and a professor of robotics at ETH Zurich, said the team has barely begun to understand what this technology will make possible. He expects surgeons will find many new uses once they see how precise the tool becomes inside the body.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The idea of a grain-sized robot navigating the bloodstream sounds bold, yet the science behind it is moving forward fast. Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful. This work still sits in the early stages, but it already points toward a new era of medical robotics.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Most major platforms have dealt with large-scale data leaks tied to weak or unprotected APIs. You've seen this play out with Facebook, X and even Dell.",
      "The pattern is always the same. A feature meant to make life easier becomes a gateway for bulk data collection.",
      "WhatsApp is now part of that list after researchers managed to scrape 3.5 billion phone numbers by exploiting a simple gap in the app's contact-discovery system.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",
      "7 steps you can take to keep your WhatsApp data safe",
      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "WhatsApp might have fixed the issue, but the bigger problem is still out there. Any platform that exposes an API without proper rate limits is leaving a window open for someone with the right tools and enough time. This scrape shows you how quickly that window can turn into a firehose of personal data. Until API security becomes a priority across the board, you'll keep seeing leaks like this repeat on bigger and bigger scales.",

      "\"Since 2023, we've had a lively and very active presence on campus,\" Burnett told Fox News Digital. \"We've hosted several events, we were able to rush at club rush. We had students very enthusiastic about our presence being there. It was even something that made us stand out as a Christian university, was the fact that Turning Point was practiced, and it was not only practiced, but it was also celebrated.\"",

      "\"During and after the 2024 withdrawal of American forces from Niger, the U.S. (under the Biden administration) also chose to forego keeping those forces in the region,\" the former major general added. \"Resultantly, the U.S. surrendered its ability to monitor and respond to the activities and growth of Sahel terrorist organizations, come to the assistance of U.S. embassies under threat, and solve crises like the October kidnapping of an American missionary.\"",

      "Reuters reported that the directive, sent to all U.S. missions on Dec. 2, instructs consular officers to review resumes, LinkedIn profiles and any publicly available information to determine whether an applicant \u2014 or family members traveling with them \u2014 previously worked in areas including misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance or online safety.",
      "According to the cable cited by Reuters, officers should \"pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible\" if they uncover evidence the individual was \"responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States.\"",

We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans.

Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.\"",

The EU should be supporting free speech, not attacking American companies over garbage.\"",
      "Further underscoring the administration's determination to fight censorship, Undersecretary of State Sarah Rogers posted a video on X responding to a European member of parliament stating she was \"revisiting some remarks for which people in Europe and also the U.K. have been investigated or arrested or jailed by their governments over the past few years,\" and listed examples from Germany, the U.K. and Sweden.\"",

      "\u201cShe is unfortunately not in Norway and will not stand on stage at Oslo City Hall at 1 p.m. when the ceremony starts,\u201d Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the institute and the permanent secretary of the award body, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, according to Reuters.",
      "Asked where she was, Harpviken said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Machado \u201chas done everything in her power to come to the ceremony today,\u201d the Nobel Institute said in a statement. \u201cWe are profoundly happy to confirm that she is safe and that she will be with us in Oslo,\u201d the institute added, without expanding on her exact whereabouts.",
      "Machado, 58, is barred from leaving Venezuela and has spent more than a year in hiding since the authoritarian regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared him the winner in an election last year that was widely criticized as rigged. She had been the opposition\u2019s original candidate against Maduro, but the government prevented her from running.",
      "Authorities in Venezuela, where Machado has been under a decade-long travel ban, have said she will be considered a fugitive if she attempts to travel abroad. She was last seen in public on Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after appearing with supporters at a protest in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, the day before Maduro was sworn in for his third six-year term.",
      "A news conference in Oslo where Machado was supposed to appear was canceled on Tuesday after a delay of several hours. The Nobel Institute did not say whether the news conference, which laureates traditionally hold the day before the formal award ceremony, would be rescheduled.",
      "\u201cMachado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo, Norway, will be,\u201d it said Tuesday.",
      "Harpviken said the ceremony would still go ahead and that Machado\u2019s daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, would accept the award in her place.",
      "The Nobel Institute did not immediately reply to an emailed request for additional comment.",
      "The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which hands out the annual prize, recognized Machado in October for keeping \u201cthe flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\u201d and for \u201cher tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Machado said at the time that the honor was the \u201cachievement of a whole society.\u201d",
      "But the committee\u2019s decision has come under criticism amid Machado\u2019s support for President Donald Trump\u2019s military buildup in the Caribbean as well as the use of force to remove Maduro. Trump said Tuesday that Maduro\u2019s \u201cdays are numbered,\u201d declining to comment on whether the U.S. might send troops into the oil-rich South American nation.",
      "After being awarded the prize in October, Machado dedicated it in part to Trump, who along with his supporters has openly campaigned for his own Nobel Peace Prize. She has been unwavering in her support for U.S. military actions against the Venezuelan regime, which have included strikes of questionable legality on alleged drug trafficking boats in the nearby Caribbean Sea.",
      "According to the Pentagon, almost 90 people have been killed in 22 strikes in the Caribbean and off Latin America\u2019s Pacific coast. The administration has produced no evidence to support its allegations about the boats or the people on board.",
      "Machado has also supported forceful means to dislodge Maduro, saying the country\u2019s elections are a sham.",
      "\u201cYou cannot have peace without freedom, and you cannot have freedom without strength,\u201d she told NPR a day after winning the prize on Oct. 10.",
      "In a February interview with Donald Trump Jr. Machado said that Maduro was the head of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Her comments came a month after President Trump listed it as a foreign terrorist organization and he has since used this as justification for his strikes and deportation of Venezuelans.",
      "However, the U.S. intelligence community has contradicted the claims that Maduro is directing the gang.",
      "The Norwegian Peace Council, a group of 17 organizations promoting conflict resolution that is separate from the Nobel Committee, said in October that Machado does not \u201calign with the core values\u201d of the council, adding it was not going to hold its annual tradition of honoring the new laureate with a torchlight procession on Wednesday.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cthe Lady of Steel\u201d and \u201cthe Iron Lady,\u201d Machado, an engineer and mother of three, revitalized Venezuela\u2019s opposition, standing up against Maduro\u2019s rule and his government\u2019s crackdown against opposition figures, journalists and civil society at large.",
      "She was barred from running for president against Maduro in July 2024, backing another opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, instead. While Gonz\u00e1lez was recognized as the winner internationally, Maduro claimed victory, resulting in deadly mass protests.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez later sought asylum after a Venezuelan court issued a warrant for his arrest, while Machado was forced into exile inside her own country, fearing retaliation from the Maduro regime.",
      "\u201cDespite serious threats against her life she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions of people,\u201d the Nobel Committee said in its announcement.",
      "Despite holding the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, the collapse of Venezuela\u2019s economy under Maduro has led to pervasive poverty and a mass exodus of Venezuelans that has become the largest displacement crisis in the world."

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 22:56:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Doctors say the controversial vote to not recommend the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns is creating chaos and hurdles for parents.",
    "story": [
      "Doctors, hospitals and public health departments are scrambling to ensure proper care for pregnant women and their babies following a controversial vote from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers that reversed decades of standard medical practice giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t really know just yet how individual hospitals and clinicians will handle this,\u201d said Dr. Brenna Hughes, interim chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s creating fear and distrust.\u201d",
      "Last Friday, the CDC's vaccine panel advised that only babies born to women who test positive for hepatitis B should get the first dose within 24 hours of delivery. The decision rolled back decades-long guidance that all newborns should be protected against the lifelong, incurable infection that can lead to liver disease and cancer.",
      "Many babies in the U.S., however, are born to women who never have the chance to be tested.",
      "A March of Dimes report published in November found that nearly a quarter of pregnant women aren\u2019t under a doctor\u2019s care during their first trimester, when most women are tested for hepatitis B.",
      "Dr. Steven Fleishman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns acts as a safety net.",
      "\u201cIf there is someone who gets exposed to hepatitis B later in pregnancy, or develops an infection later on,\u201d Fleishman said, \u201cthe baby is protected by that vaccine.\u201d The virus can pass from mom to baby during delivery.",
      "As of Tuesday, acting CDC director Jim O\u2019Neill hadn\u2019t yet signed off on the committee\u2019s recommendation. The agency isn\u2019t required to follow the panel\u2019s advice, but usually does.",
      "The CDC doesn't mandate vaccination. It recommends a schedule for children to be protected against infectious diseases. The vaccine panel regularly reviews data and makes changes to the schedule based on guidance by doctors or scientists with expertise in the subject matter.",
      "But experts said the advisory panel, stacked with members handpicked in June by Health Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., failed to provide the kind of scientific evidence historically associated with the CDC to back up its reasoning.",
      "The group \u201chas not followed the standard and transparent process that had made the advisory committee a bastion of good evidence-based decision making,\u201d said Dr. Jason Goldman, an internal medicine doctor and president of the American College of Physicians. \u201cTheir information and decisions cannot be trusted.\u201d",
      "The panel recommended that women who test negative for hepatitis B can decide in consultation with a health care provider whether their baby should get the birth dose.",
      "The panel\u2019s vote to hold off the hepatitis B vaccine for babies until at least 2 months of age for the first dose if the vaccine is not given at birth was totally out of line with decades of evidence proving the shot\u2019s safety and effectiveness, experts say. The birth dose, implemented for all babies in the early 1990s, has driven down cases of acute hepatitis B infections in children by 99%.",
      "During a call with reporters Tuesday, Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins Medicine and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 committee on infectious diseases, said the fallout is \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d among public health experts trying to counsel clinicians on best practices, as well as doctors in exam rooms faced with worried parents.",
      "\u201cMany physicians are working across our country in fear that doing the best thing for their patient is now at odds with information coming from what were previously trusted resources,\u201d Dr. Sarah Nosal, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said during the same call.",
      "\u201cIf you have to spend 20 minutes explaining that vaccines, yes, in fact, are safe,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Schulman, professor of medicine at Stanford Medicine, \u201cthen we\u2019re not spending 20 minutes making sure the baby\u2019s on the growth curve, that you\u2019re wearing seat belts, that you\u2019re using car seats appropriately.\u201d",
      "Dr. Anna Lok, director of clinical hepatology and assistant dean for clinical research at the University of Michigan Medical School, said the change in guidance adds barriers for parents, especially in a chaotic delivery room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just telling the parents, we\u2019re going to make you climb to Mount Everest in order to get your baby vaccinated,\u201d Lok said. \u201cBecause every single step, every hurdle, is just making sure that something that should be done, doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d",
      "Dr. Rashmi Roa, an OB-GYN who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at UCLA Health, said nothing has changed from a medical standpoint. \u201cOur recommendations will stay the same.\u201d",
      "Some states are bypassing federal recommendations and instead joining forces to establish their own guidance. Dr. Naima Joseph, an OB-GYN at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said that health officials in Massachusetts and other states have formed the Northeast Public Health Collaborative.",
      "\u201cWe have already made recommendations regarding universal birth dose hepatitis B vaccine that continues to ensure access\u201d to newborns, she said.",
      "The measured approach isn\u2019t expected nationwide, said Joe Zamboni, a lawyer for the nonprofit American Families for Vaccines. \u201cI think some states will probably do it better than others,\u201d he said.",
      "One state that worries public health experts is Florida. The state\u2019s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, said in September that Florida is working to eliminate all vaccine requirements for children to attend school.",
      "The Florida Department of Health has scheduled a meeting for this Friday, Dec. 12, to discuss those requirements. A department spokeswoman told NBC News via email that the meeting will be held in Panama City and will not be available to the public online."

    "summary": "Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Spencer Cox of Utah sit in for a wide-ranging interview with \"Today\" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie.",
    "story": [
      "Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Spencer Cox of Utah decried the state of the political discourse in the country and talked of leaning on each other after high-profile cases of political violence in a wide-ranging interview with \"Today\" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday.",
      "Both have been at the forefront of handling political crises in their states.",
      "Cox, a Republican, was widely praised for his handling of the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk in Utah in September, an event that inflamed political divides. Shapiro, a Democrat, has dealt with political violence repeatedly in his state, including the attempt on President Donald Trump's life at a rally in Butler last year and the politically motivated firebombing of his own home this year.",
      "\u201cI just need to tell you when that very dark day happened in my state, the first call I got was from this guy, from Gov. Shapiro, and he gave me some advice that changed what I was going to say when I stepped in front of that camera for the first time,\u201d Cox said, speaking alongside Shapiro at the National Cathedral in Washington.",
      "\u201cHe told me to speak with moral clarity and to speak from the heart. ... I don\u2019t care what color his politics are, in that moment we were two Americans who were deeply saddened and struggling, and I\u2019m grateful that there\u2019s somebody I can trust, even though we disagree on a lot of things,\u201d he added.",
      "Shapiro had similarly received plaudits from both sides of the aisle for his handling of the aftermath of the attempt on Trump's life.",
      "In a speech about political violence days after Kirk was assassinated, Shapiro criticized the \"selective condemnation\" of such attacks.",
      "\"I never looked to myself to being any sort of expert on political violence or, frankly, needing to engage in a national conversation about political violence, until I saw Spencer Cox, in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk, handle that matter in the way that he did,\" Shapiro said Tuesday. \"I saw him lift up not just Utahns but create an opportunity for a dialog I think we sorely need in this country to try and lift everyone up and get us out of the darkness of political violence that has fallen upon us.\"",
      "Shapiro and Cox have built a friendship across party lines through their work with the National Governors Association.",
      "The event Tuesday was billed as a bipartisan conversation to address the growing spate of violent, politically motivated attacks across the country. Cox, citing research on political violence, said the U.S. is on a long-term path that could lead to civil war.",
      "A recent NBC News poll found that more than 6 in 10 registered voters \u2014 including majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 said they think \u201cextreme political rhetoric\u201d was an important contributor to Kirk's killing in September.",
      "\"I hate even using that phrase,\" Cox said. \"But if we don\u2019t make a course correction, that\u2019s where this leads.\"",
      "The event was interrupted at multiple points by protesters, who were shouting down both Shapiro and Cox, though it was unclear what they were protesting.",
      "Shapiro repeatedly talked up condemning political violence originating from right- or left-wing actors, saying Trump has failed to condemn political violence when it originates on the right.",
      "\"It should not be hard to see the [former] Minnesota speaker of the House gunned down and mourn her loss,\" he said. \"It should not be hard to follow the beautiful eulogy of Erika Kirk with an 'amen' instead of saying, 'I can\u2019t do that, I hate my enemies,' as the president did.\"",
      "Cox responded to Shapiro by noting that, in private, Trump had praised him for expressing the need for Americans to come together.",
      "\"I\u2019m not trying to play down his divisive rhetoric at all,\" Cox said. \"I\u2019m not going to do that. But I\u2019m going to say this: If we think that a president of the United States or a governor is going to change where we are right now, we\u2019re fooling ourselves. I truly believe that the people of our country are the ones who are going to have to change this.\"",
      "Both governors talked about the role they believe social media algorithms play in the country's ever-growing political divides.",
      "\"If you want to be angry at someone, be angry at the social media companies,\" Cox said, adding, \"These are the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, and they\u2019re profiting off of destroying our kids and destroying our country, and they know it, and it\u2019s very intentional.\"",
      "\"Even though they have trillion-dollar market caps, it\u2019s still not enough,\" he continued.",
      "The governors were divided, however, over whether they believe states should pass bans on social media accounts for kids under 16, which is set to take effect in Australia on Wednesday. Cox said he was \"100%\" supportive of such a ban, while Shapiro said, \"I don't know that I'd support that.\"",
      "\"The approach that we\u2019ve tried to take in Pennsylvania, led by our first lady, has been ensuring that digital literacy is taught in our classrooms, that our teachers are empowered to understand how to do it and that our students are in a position to receive that information and understand these powerful phones and computers that they have,\" Shapiro said. \"They can be used for good, but they also have to be used in a way that folks understand fact from fiction, that they understand how addictive these platforms are and how they can learn how to use them in moderation.",
      "\"We are working with our school districts to figure out the best policy on phone usage and what can be used,\" he added. \"I think it is important that young people learn about these tools, they are empowered to use them responsibly, while at the same time, those of us in positions of authority, hold these companies accountable.\"",
      "Cox said he understood Shapiro's position but countered that \"the damage is just too great on our kids right now.\"",
      "\"These are the opioid companies of the of the early 2000s,\" Cox said. \"There is no difference. ... It\u2019s addictive, and it\u2019s addictive by design. All we tried to do was to make them remove the most addictive features on their products for kids, that\u2019s it. And they wouldn\u2019t even do that. So it just, they\u2019re bad-faith actors, and they no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt.\"",
      "At the conclusion of the discussion, Guthrie asked the governors whether either is running for president in 2028. Shapiro is widely seen as a 2028 Democratic presidential contender.",
      "\"One of us is not,\" Cox said.",
      "Shapiro did not answer."

    "story": [
      "For a company at the center of a chaotic battle over the future of Hollywood, Warner Bros. Discovery had a pretty good Monday.",
      "The media conglomerate\u2019s film \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and TV show \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d collected the most Golden Globe nominations in their categories. Another of its movies, \u201cSinners,\u201d also fared well, earning seven nominations.",
      "But the studio did not have much time to celebrate. Just as actors Marlon Wayans and Skye P. Marshall were calling the names of Golden Globe nominees at a news conference at the Beverly Hilton, Paramount launched a hostile takeover bid for WBD valued at more than $108 billion.",
      "WBD\u2019s board and shareholders are weighing competing offers for the studio from Netflix and Paramount. Meanwhile, voters in Hollywood are beginning their deliberations as award season ramps up. Many of the seven Hollywood insiders NBC News spoke with \u2014 including producers, marketers and former studio executives \u2014 said the looming media merger will shape votes for upcoming awards shows, including the Directors Guild Awards, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the coveted Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cThis deal is an emotional piece of news for a lot of people,\u201d said \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d producer Edward Saxon, a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chair of the producing program at the University of Southern California\u2019s film school. \u201cThere\u2019s worry about consolidation and about the future of theatrical. The feeling is I don\u2019t get a vote on so much of what\u2019s happening in the industry right now. If I do have a vote on something, I\u2019m going to vote against consolidation.\u201d",
      "Months of speculation about the future of WBD came to a head last week. On Friday, WBD\u2019s board agreed to sell the company\u2019s film, TV and streaming assets to Netflix for $82.7 billion, sparking a backlash from Hollywood guilds, movie theater owners and politicians on both sides of the aisle over a deal they say would harm workers and consumers.",
      "The deal came as something of a surprise. Paramount had been linked to WBD since September, and Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters had publicly downplayed Netflix\u2019s interest.",
      "Some academy members say the possibility of Netflix\u2019s owning Warner Bros., one of the last five traditional movie studios in Hollywood, is cementing their aversion to its business model.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t any love lost for Netflix in the industry right now,\u201d said a veteran academy member who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cThe industry feels like they\u2019re a TV company masquerading as a film company.\u201d",
      "In a conference call with investors and the media Friday, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that Netflix has no \u201copposition to movies in theaters\u201d and that it would uphold Warner Bros.\u2019 existing theatrical agreements. But he also said that \u201cover time the [theatrical] windows will evolve.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Netflix was hit with a consumer lawsuit seeking to block the WBD acquisition on the grounds that it threatens to reduce competition. \u201cWe believe this suit is meritless and is merely an attempt by the plaintiffs bar to leverage all the attention on the deal,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson said.",
      "Netflix has released 10 best picture nominees in its history, beginning with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \u201cRoma\u201d in 2019, but it has never won the film industry\u2019s biggest prize, in part because of an industry perception that its business model has contributed to the decline of the theatrical movie business.",
      "This year, the company has contenders in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d the George Clooney vehicle \u201cJay Kelly\u201d and the animated musical sensation \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Some in Hollywood have defended Netflix from criticism, saying it has opened the door to more creative people.",
      "\u201cThere are some people that only get their chance because of streamers,\u201d actor Joel Edgerton, whose quiet drama \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d Netflix bought at Sundance last year, told Variety at the Gotham Awards in New York this month.",
      "Other awards voters say they may give a boost to Warner Bros.\u2019 contending titles, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of this year being the last hurrah for Warner,\u201d said another academy member, who requested anonymity so as not to offend Netflix. \u201cThere\u2019s sympathy for the people who work there and what they\u2019re going through. And the heads of the film studio [Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy] are well-loved.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about his film\u2019s seven Golden Globe nominations Monday, Coogler answered a question about the pending WBD deal by saying, \u201cTheatrical releases mean everything to me,\u201d a diplomatic way of signaling worry about a Netflix deal.",
      "Paramount and Netflix will face regulatory hurdles if their offer prevails. Paramount has consistently touted its close ties to the White House as an advantage over other bidders, and, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, some of its financial backing for the deal comes from Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law.",
      "Paramount has less of a stake in this year\u2019s awards race, apart from \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning,\u201d which is likely to contend in technical categories like sound and visual effects at the Oscars. But the studio owns CBS and Paramount+, which next month will broadcast and stream the Golden Globes, an event that functions as a marketing vehicle for the nominated films and a low-stakes party for Hollywood.",
      "At last year\u2019s Globes, which aired two weeks before Trump was inaugurated for his second term and several months before David Ellison\u2019s Skydance bought the network, host Nikki Glaser poked fun at Hollywood\u2019s liberal but largely ineffectual politics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here to roast you,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cAnd how could I? You\u2019re all so famous, so talented, so powerful. I mean, you could really do anything \u2014 except tell the country who to vote for. But it\u2019s OK. You\u2019ll get them next time!\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Glaser did not respond to a question about whether her set will include political humor this year."

      "What haunts Reger most is what he says happened after his father confronted the pastor: practically nothing. By the time the Royal Rangers leader was convicted in 1988 of abusing two other children, at least 18 boys said they had been molested by him and a fellow troop leader, according to lawsuits and police records.",

Reporters have spent a year examining sexual abuse allegations within the Assemblies of God, which has 13,000 churches across the United States. Despite dozens of lawsuits and pleas from survivors, the denomination has resisted making child safety policies mandatory \u2014 including for the Royal Rangers.",
      "At least 29 Royal Rangers leaders have been accused of sexually abusing boys in their care over the past half century, according to a review of lawsuits, police reports and news clips. The volunteers were often well-regarded: men with master\u2019s degrees, sons of pastors or aspiring preachers themselves. One was a judge in Pennsylvania who pleaded guilty in 2021 to the corruption of minors. They lured their alleged victims under the guise of woodworking projects, rides home from school and games of Dungeons & Dragons.",
      "The men were accused of sexually abusing at least 83 boys in the Royal Rangers and dozens more outside the ministry \u2014 though the true total is almost certainly higher. Like other scouting programs, the Royal Rangers have attracted serial predators whose full victim counts may never be known. In Illinois, a man convicted in 1990 of sexually assaulting two boys from his troop told authorities he had molested as many as 75 children, a claim prosecutors never publicly confirmed.",
      "Some abuses surfaced only by chance. In Florida, a longtime Royal Rangers leader was arrested in 2000 after his abandoned storage unit was auctioned off. The buyer called police after discovering a photo book of nude children titled \u201cBoys Will Be Boys!\u201d along with Polaroids of a naked child. Confronted by authorities, the man handed over hundreds more pictures and confessed to molesting Royal Rangers over three decades, photographing each victim as a keepsake, according to police records and news reports.",
      "In several instances, church officials allowed men convicted of molesting boys to lead Royal Rangers troops, enabling them to harm again, criminal records show. Some Assemblies of God ministers sent suspected abusers to counseling or put them on probation rather than calling police. Others were accused of pressuring children into silence."

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 22:21:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A new apple named Ludacrisp from Pacello Orchard is named after the Grammy award-winning artist Ludacris. Here's the story behind the naming process.",
    "story": [
      "It may seem rather ludicrous that a brand-new apple varietal was named after the Grammy-winning artist behind \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Fantasy,\u201d but millennials are a unique cohort.",
      "\u201cI came from a family of farmers,\u201d JP Pacello, owner of upstate New York\u2019s Pacello Orchard, tells TODAY.com, adding that his grandfather first farmed corn, beans and wheat on the land that 37-year-old Pacello now grows apples on.",
      "\u201cI started planting trees and fell in love with it, started expanding the orchard and now we are up to about 200 acres of planted orchard with several fresh varieties,\u201d Pacello says. \u201cWe don\u2019t do any processing or juicing; it\u2019s all fresh: Galas, Honeycrisp, Evercrisp and Ludacrisp.\u201d",
      "The last apple variety he mentioned is relatively new to consumers, having been offered to orchards in 2021 and Sprouts Farmers Markets starting last year. And, of course, its name stands out on the apple stand.",
      "While Ludacris, the artist, is known for platinum records and blockbusters like the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, his apple counterpart is also garnering quite the name for itself. All over social media, folks who have seen the apple in passing have made the connection between pome and performer.",
      "\u201cMove over, Honeycrisp\u2026 there\u2019s a new apple in town,\u201d said Kat Kurdz in an October TikTok with millions of views, soundtracked by \u201cNumber One Spot.\u201d Tickled users flooded the comments with Ludacris lyrics like, \u201cWill they be available in different Area Codes?\u201d, \u201cThey said \u2018ROLLOUT\u2019\u201d and \u201cMove, crisp, get out the way.\u201d",
      "Pacello came up with the name of the apple variety as part of his membership with the Midwest Apple Improvement Association (MAIA), a 1,200-member-strong organization founded and run by growers to produce apple varieties available to orchards in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cWe grew up in the era of DMX, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, Lil Jon, those are the popular rappers, especially Ludacris, and so I was just trying to think of a name that would attract my age group,\u201d he explains.",
      "According to MAIA, which has produced other apple varieties like the Red Zeppelin and the Evercrisp, the Ludacrisp apple originates from an open-pollination of the Sweet 16 apple variety. The Ludacrisp harvests in mid- to late-October and has a flavor akin to Juicy Fruit gum \u2014 which was almost its name \u2014 according to MAIA president and CEO Bill Dodd.",
      "\u201cApple breeding is not an incredibly difficult process, but it\u2019s an incredibly time consuming process,\u201d says Dodd. \u201cWe have about nine apples that we have released. So Ludacrisp is one of them and it started about 25 to 27 years ago.\u201d",
      "MAIA actively breeds new varieties of apples with the intent of patenting them, naming them and releasing them to the public.",
      "\u201cIf you take an apple seed from any apple and plant it, it will be like a child,\u201d Dodd says, adding that any apple seed is a mix of two parent trees: the tree the apple grew on and tree one that provided the pollen.",
      "\u201cSo when you plant a seed, it\u2019s going to be something new, and so that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou plant those seeds, the trees grow, they start to produce apples. 98% of them are terrible and you throw them away, but some of them are exceptional and have the good characteristics that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d",
      "Dodd says these varieties are then grafted onto when new apples are then grafted and onto other trees, then ready to be offered to growers. One of the final pieces is the name; MAIA\u2019s membership is pooled for suggestions. And the name \u201cLudacrisp\u201d proved to be very polarizing.",
      "In a meeting with about 20 people, \u201cthe room was completely split,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThere was no one who was indifferent about it. They either thought it was the greatest thing ever or they hated it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Boom, that\u2019s what we want,\u2019\u201d he says \u2014 an apple that\u2019s a talker. After deciding on the name, MAIA went through the trademarking process, and \u201cbada bing, bada boom,\u201d he says.",
      "With his namesake fruit, Ludacris joins an elite group of humans with apples named after them. The McIntosh apple is named for farmer John McIntosh, who discovered the variety in Ontario, Canada back in 1811; the Granny Smith apple was named after Maria Ann Smith in 1868; and the Pink Lady apple was named for Australian Maud \u201cLady\u201d Williams in the \u201880s. There\u2019s also Early Joe, Jonathan, King David and Kaiser Wilhelm, among others, but not too many folks from this century hold the distinction.",
      "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know how Ludacris himself feels about it: Representatives for the rapper did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Given the rapper\u2019s penchant for surrealism, though \u2014 comic-book arms in his iconic \u201cGet Back\u201d video and giant objects all over the \u201cStand Up\u201d  video \u2014 people photoshopping his face onto apples fits right in.",
      "Our farmers remain hopeful this apple will have as much longevity as its eponym \u2014 perhaps even more.",
      "\u201cI give you my ultimate goal in life here,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThe people that were in the Ludacris kind of time frame are aging, and so I\u2019m waiting for my grandkids, or somebody\u2019s grandkids, to come up to me and say, \u2018Did you know there\u2019s a rapper named after an apple?\u2019\u201d"

      "So this, Poppy realized, was Hinge \u2014 her sister\u2019s dating app. And here, the digital version of Dandelion was still alive, being cheeky. Securing likes.",
      "Dandelion had shown Poppy some profiles of potential suitors before (mainly the funny ones), but Poppy had never seen her sister\u2019s actual profile, how she marketed herself. It was titled with three sentences that Poppy read a few times, her brain glitching on the facts that were now redundant: Dandelion. 39. Does Not Want Kids.",
      "As well as the Glastonbury photo, there was a close-up of Dandelion in bed looking sleepy, her skin prickling pink like it did when she was just out of a hot bath. In the next one, she was in her neon seersucker swimsuit in a deck chair somewhere exotic, a (probable) Negroni in her hand. In the last picture, Poppy saw herself. It was from a recent-ish Halloween party; the two of them and their friend Jetta had dressed up in vintage Adidas and tucked all their hair up into short, curly wigs. They\u2019d been characters from the film \"The Royal Tenenbaums\"; Dandelion was the dad (Ben Stiller), and Poppy and Jetta had been his two matching red-tracksuited little kids.",
      "In Hinge\u2019s inbox, Dandelion had 173 matches and countless messages. Poppy tapped on a few at random. First, a girl (too young) called Chloe, a dancer. Dandelion had never answered her Sup? To an electrician called Gerald, Dandelion had gone in with Gezza, tell me a joke. He\u2019d come back with one about an Englishman an Irishman and a Scotsman, to which Dandelion had replied immediately: I no like, byebye!",
      "As Poppy scrolled, it became apparent that her sister lied a lot, which was no enormous surprise. She told people she was an exotic dancer and a firefighter and trilingual and super into roller blading \u2014 which caused Poppy to huff an appreciative laugh. She gave Hinge\u2019s inbox one final, long swipe so that the names of tiny digital people careered past, like the bounty of a slot machine, before slowing and slowing and coming to rest on Jake.",

      "(my son is three.",
      "Split custody. No biggy)",
      "The messages had been hanging, unanswered, for a year. Poppy liked the sound of Jake; she liked that he\u2019d felt her sister\u2019s heat.",
      "It seemed highly possible that Jake\u2019s main photo was a covert selfie, that he\u2019d extended his arm and looked the other way as he\u2019d taken the picture, pretending not to pose. In it, his hair was buzzed short and his eyes were closed, which maybe was the point, because it showed his eyelashes, top and bottom together, unusually thick and pretty in his square-jawed face. In another picture, he was wearing a faded cap pushed back, his dark hair curled behind his ears. He had dimples, or maybe just the one dimple eddying into his right cheek. His profile said he was 40, but he dressed boyish: sweatshirts, worn-out jeans and trainers.",
      "Mainly, the other men Poppy had seen on Hinge were topless in a toilet taking unsmiling selfies, or Lycra clad and bulging, un- smiling on a bike. But Jake was playing Jenga with his son (captioned My Little Bud), and grinning wide and silly. In the cap picture, he was sitting with friends, holding craft beers in colorful cans on the crest of a hill, and the last shot wasn\u2019t even him, but a handsome sky at dusk.",
      "From a nearby garden the gnawing of an engine started: a mower or a chain saw. Poppy stood, and in front of the long mirror, she looked at herself and frowned. Throughout their whole lives, people had found the sisters to be confusingly similar. And, yes, Poppy knew their eyes (hair, complexion, voice, laugh), and, probably, skeletons, were ostensibly interchangeable, but she\u2019d always felt the comparison to her sister to be overly generous, like comparing a Tuesday morning to a Friday night. Two and a half years older, Dandelion had been more attractive and more confident. More mischievous (nefarious, lightly evil). Later, more successful, pretty much running a hedge fund by the age of 35. Consequently, Dandelion had been considerably more wealthy \u2014 bought her gorgeous flat with cash. Mainly, though, and ironically, as it turned out, compared to Poppy and to anyone Poppy had ever met \u2014 Dandelion seemed more vital. She\u2019d been filled with much more life.",
      "Poppy smoothed her hair into a ponytail and stepped closer to her reflection. \u201cYes, thanks, I know I look like shit. I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I ran here.\u201d She thought of her boyfriend then, waking on a Sunday morning to find her gone; he\u2019d be brewing coffee and, quite possibly, a sulk. \u201cAnyway, better go. Thanks for the phone,\u201d she said, through an inhale. Around her the room got bigger, gaped large and painful like an open wound.",
      "In the hallway, Poppy locked the bedroom door and reread Jake\u2019s messages. I can feel your heat kept catching like a splinter, though it didn\u2019t hurt. It was more that the world hurt and this one line felt soothing. It was so true \u2014 Dandelion had been a wildfire. She\u2019d ripped through life. She\u2019d frazzled. Poppy closed her eyes and, next to her, she felt her sister scorching. She felt her sister nudging.

      "But the Duffers went further than simply singing Love's praises on Instagram: They gave her a recurring role in \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 as Miss Harris, who just happens to be a school teacher.",
      "\"I was delighted to be asked!\" Love tells TODAY.com in a video interview from her classroom.",
      "Love has kept in touch with the Duffer brothers since she met them as freshmen in high school. She says she always sent them a note after each \"Stranger Things\" season ended to tell them all the things that \"delighted\" her.",
      "But after Season 4 aired in 2022, Love got a very interesting message back. The Duffers said they were hoping she might have played a small role that season but they ended up cutting the part.",
      "\"I showed it to my husband. I said, 'How lovely are these boys to lie to me like this and make me feel good, right?'\" Love recalls, laughing.",
      "But in December 2024, Love received a \"missive\" from the brothers, doubling down on their \"lie.\"",
      "\"They\u2019re like, 'Hey, remember that thing we talked about? We think we can do it now. Are you available? Could you find the time? It\u2019ll probably be summer. We hope you could make it work,'\" Love says. \"And I was like, 'Make it work? I think I\u2019ll make it work!'\"",
      "From Durham to Hawkins",
      "Love, who is in her 30th year of teaching, first met Matt and Ross Duffer when they were freshmen at C.E. Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina.",
      "\"They weren't musical kids,\" Love, who now teaches at a high school in Chapel Hill, says. \"But even then, they considered themselves artists ... who were working on a craft that would serve them now and beyond.\"",
      "Though they may not have been able to sing and dance well enough to be cast as designated characters in the school's production of \"Once Upon a Mattress,\" Love created roles for them as \"mimes and sidekicks to the Troubadour\" in the show.",
      "\"The reason they were cast often is because they were artists I wanted to spend time with and work with,\" she says. \"They spent a lot of time filming a lot of the projects that we were completing, and that was a way for them to stay involved and work on the craft that really interests them.\"",
      "After growing up in and around Durham's theater scene, the Duffer brothers \u2014 whether intentionally or not \u2014 cast a number of young Broadway actors in their breakout hit show.",
      "Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) was only 8 when he appeared in \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\" Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) had already portrayed Young Simba in \"The Lion King\" for two years. And Sadie Sink (Max) played multiple roles in the 2012 revival of \"Annie.\"",
      "In many ways, it seems that through \"Stranger Things,\" the Duffers really celebrate \"theater kids,\" Dungeons and Dragons players and anyone who may stand out as different.",
      "But Love thinks theater kids aren't just having a moment. Instead, she says, \"I think we've always had a moment inside of our own tribe. I think everybody else is catching on to how cool we are. It\u2019s been a secret club, and maybe now the secret\u2019s out.\"",
      "High School and Beyond",
      "In the post dedicated to Love, Ross Duffer said Love is the reason he and his brother decided to \"chase our dreams.\"",
      "\u201cHigh school was rough for me and my brother,\" he said. \"But Hope saw something in us we didn\u2019t see in ourselves \u2014 and she helped give us the confidence to not only survive those four years, but to move to L.A. and chase our dreams.\u201d",
      "He added, \"Shoutout to all the teachers out there making a difference. And please \u2026 let\u2019s prioritize the arts in schools.\"",
      "Love couldn't agree more.",
      "\"Having quality arts education and access to quality teachers \u2014 period \u2014 is such a formative part of our democracy,\" she says. \"Everybody can remember a teacher who either ushered them along a path that they were already on, or felt like a gatekeeper and stomped them down a path they were curious about. And I think one of the fundamental bedrocks of a healthy democratic society is everybody has access.\"",
      "Love\u2019s current and former students went on to sing her praises in the comment section of Ross Duffer's Instagram post:",
      "\u201cHope is still a teacher, and I take her class currently ...

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:38:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Paramount is launching a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros.",
    "story": [
      "Paramount is launching a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery after it lost to Netflix in a high-stakes bidding war, the company announced Monday, setting the stage for a corporate drama worthy of \u201cSuccession.\u201d",
      "Paramount said it would offer $30 per share for the media conglomerate, which owns the Warner Bros. film studio, the cable channel HBO, the streaming service HBO Max and a portfolio of cable brands.",
      "In a federal securities filing, Paramount said the hostile bid will be backed in part by funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates as well as Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law.",
      "The bid comes after Netflix agreed last week to buy a large part of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share. Netflix\u2019s takeover would not include the Warner-owned cable channels, which include CNN and TNT.",
      "The offer lays the groundwork for what could become a public and contentious battle for Warner Bros., a process that had already included appeals to Trump, who said he intends to play a role in any merger.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s board of directors has already approved its deal with Netflix, but Paramount\u2019s move to go directly to shareholders \u2014 a maneuver known in the business world as a hostile bid \u2014 will push what had been private negotiations into the public realm.",
      "Paramount\u2019s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery is the latest head-spinning twist in a saga that has riveted Hollywood, where film and television executives are growing increasingly uneasy about studio consolidation, contracting content spending and the rise of generative artificial intelligence.",
      "In a news release, Paramount said its offer to Warner Bros. shareholders \u201cprovides a superior alternative to the Netflix transaction,\u201d warning that a deal with the streaming giant risks entangling the studio in a complex regulatory process.",
      "\u201cWBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\u201d Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOur public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment.",
      "Ellison acquired Paramount earlier this year in an $8 billion deal that housed the studio\u2019s assets under his company Skydance. He is the son of Larry Ellison, a billionaire technology magnate with close ties to Trump.",
      "Unlike Netflix\u2019s bid, Paramount\u2019s offer would be a all cash, backstopped by the Ellison family\u2019s fortune. The company also said it has a $54 billion funding commitment from Bank of America, Citi and private equity firm Apollo Global. The total value of the deal would be more than $108 billion.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really here to to finish what we started,\u201d Ellison told CNBC shortly after announcing the bid.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine the No. 1 streamer with the No. 3 streamer, that creates a company that has unprecedented market power, north of 400 million subscribers,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThe next largest competitor is Disney, with just under 200 million. That\u2019s bad for Hollywood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe we have the superior offer, we\u2019re taking that directly to shareholders and we think that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d Ellison said.",
      "Major corporate acquisitions are already complicated affairs, and when companies are willing to launch hostile bids and outbid each other, they can turn combative and litigious. But the competition for Warner Bros. Discovery has been further complicated by Trump\u2019s political involvement.",
      "While such acquisitions are always subject to government regulatory approval, it is exceedingly rare for a president to take a public role in a private transaction.",
      "On Sunday, Trump said Netflix buying Warner Bros. could be an antitrust \u201cproblem.\u201d He added that he will \u201cbe involved\u201d in the approval process for that deal.",
      "The president also said that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos had recently visited him in the Oval Office to discuss the deal, but that Trump made no promises.",
      "Asked about Trump on CNBC, Ellison said that he\u2019s \u201cincredibly grateful for the relations that I have with the president.\u201d He added that he believes Trump \u201cbelieves in competition.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had great conversations with the president about this,\u201d Ellison also said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to speak for him in any way, shape or form.\u201d",
      "In a Truth Social post published just minutes after Paramount announced its hostile bid, Trump blasted the company over Sunday\u2019s installment of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which featured an interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a firebrand conservative who has become a fierce critic of the president.",
      "\u201cMy real problem with the show, however, wasn\u2019t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cTHEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\u201d",
      "The president was referring to the $16 million Paramount paid to settle a lawsuit from Trump over an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Trump accused CBS of having deceptively edited the segment \u2014 a claim the network denied.",
      "CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s post.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery hung up a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign earlier this year and announced plans to split into two publicly traded entities \u2014 one for streaming and studio assets, the other for cable networks. The offers from media giants then came rolling in.",
      "In the event Netflix\u2019s bid is approved, Warner-owned cable brands like CNN, TBS and TNT would be housed under a separate public company.",
      "Comcast, the corporation that owns NBC News, similarly plans to spin off cable brands such as MS Now (formerly MSNBC) and CNBC into a separate public company.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped about 6% at the opening of trading, while Netflix shares fell 1.3% and Paramount shares advanced about 4%.",

      "The daughter of screen legends Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Jamie Lee Curtis was just 19 when she made her big-screen debut in John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic \"Halloween.\" Curtis went on to show off her comedy chops in a starring role on the ABC sitcom \"Anything But Love\" and in box office hits including \"Trading Places\" (1983), \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988) and \"Freaky Friday\" (2003).",

      "It\u2019s also led to renewed interest in Reid\u2019s book.",
      "\u201cIt feels, like, not real,\u201d Reid says. \u201cThe No. 1 book in the Kindle store is a sexually explicit gay hockey romance.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d is the second book in Reid\u2019s \u201cGame Changers\u201d book series, each of which spotlights a different couple against the backdrop of pro hockey.",
      "A lifelong Montreal Canadiens fan, Reid says the series started with her imagining what it would like for an NHL player to come out and be \u201chappy, safe and fulfilled by doing that.\u201d (The NHL has never had an out active player.)",
      "\u201cAnd then I just thought, OK, well if that happened, then what happens for other players? What\u2019s the ripple effect of that? And that became the rest of the series,\u201d she says.",
      "Shane and Ilya are part of that \u201cripple effect.\u201d Their story is told in 2019\u2019s \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d the second book in the series, and revisited in book six, titled \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d which published in April 2022.",
      "Below, Reid discusses her experience being \u201ckept in the loop\u201d throughout the process of developing \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d for TV, the first time she met actors Williams and Storie and if she\u2019d ever return to writing about Shane and Ilya.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Yeah, that was a pretty good day. I had actually been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease three or four days before that. So getting that message at that time was pretty huge for me. It was exactly what I needed.",
      "It all went pretty quickly. The next day, we had a Zoom call, and he laid out his whole vision for the show, which is exactly the show that everybody\u2019s seeing. I was just thrilled. I was trying to keep my cool about it, but afterward, I was definitely like, oh, my God. He\u2019s a pretty big deal in Canada, so I knew if he really wanted to do this, it would happen.",
      "Mostly I was just, like, kept in the loop. Jacob wrote all the scripts. I was not involved in writing them, but I did read them all. He sent them all to me \u2014 even early drafts, he just wanted my opinion. I think my approval was very important to him, which is very touching and nice.",
      "I went to visit set a few times. I don\u2019t know anything about filmmaking, so I wasn\u2019t really looking to interfere or anything. And I trusted Jacob completely, right from that first phone call. And the scripts were so good, so I didn\u2019t have any worries, really.",
      "I didn\u2019t expect to be so \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say, like, respected, but it\u2019s kind of that. I know other authors who have had their works adapted, and they did not have this experience that I had. Like either their works never really ended up being adapted at all, they were just optioned, and then then it never happened. Or, it was done in a way that they were very much not in the loop. I think a disappointing adaptation would be worse than no adaptation at all, probably.",
      "But for me, just the whole thing was a dream. And you can even see with the way that the promotion of the show is going, everybody\u2019s still mentioning the book, mentioning me, crediting me for so much. It\u2019s really nice. I wasn\u2019t expecting any of that.",
      "The first two, I love that they released them together because each one has so much going on. They\u2019re action packed, and I feel like they could have just done one at a time and still had everybody hooked, but giving everybody two to talk about, it\u2019s been fun.",
      "I have seen rough cuts of the rest of the episodes. I haven\u2019t seen the final. I said I wanted to wait and just watch it with everyone else, but the rough cuts were incredible. I truly do think the episodes get better and better, and the first two are very strong.",
      "I met them on set when I visited back in May (2025). That was my first time ever on a film set.",
      "I met Hudson first. He was filming the scene that we see in Episode 1, where he\u2019s turning on and off a lamp, waiting for Ilya to come to the hotel room, so there\u2019s no dialogue. Then I met him after very briefly, because he was very busy that day. I think he was in every scene that was being shot. He gave me a hug. It was definitely surreal, because I was just like, you really do seem like the character in so many ways.",
      "But when I got home from that trip, he sent me a lovely DM, saying how much he loved playing this character and that really meant a lot to me. So definitely endeared me to him right away.",
      "Connor, I met on set. He sort of stays in the Ilya voice all day when he\u2019s on set. So I basically met him as Ilya, which was kind of a lot to process for me. It wasn\u2019t until I went back and visited the set again and I got to sit down, have a beer with them, and meet him as Connor \u2014 totally different person.",
      "They\u2019re both just so wonderful. I told both of them when I was in Toronto last week, that just them being themselves is better marketing for the show than you could ever pay for. They\u2019re just so authentically themselves in every interview, they legitimately are nuts about each other, they\u2019re best friends. They say that all the time. They\u2019re just lovely people.",
      "I think I have to see them that way if I want to ever write anything with them again, because that is difficult. But their performances are so strong \u2014 I was telling Connor, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t remember what Ilya used to look like. Like, I can\u2019t see him in my head anymore. So that\u2019s tricky.",
      "I think the way Hudson plays Shane, that\u2019s kind of changed some of the story stuff for me. I was like, jeez, he\u2019s really in love with him, really quickly. You can see it on his face. So, yeah, that\u2019s a little bit different, but I like it.",
      "They play them the way they should be portrayed, which is very young and boyish and playful. I think sometimes in romance novels, no matter how old a character is, whether they\u2019re in college or whatever, we picture this rugged man. They\u2019re often kind of written that way, and I feel like maybe even I did that, too, with these characters. But when you see them actually brought to life onscreen, it\u2019s like, oh yeah, they\u2019re so young.",
      "Jacob took it very seriously. Like more seriously than romance ever gets taken. I hope it\u2019s going to change the way romance gets filmed. I don\u2019t think anybody thought you could actually take a high heat romance and really film it, you know? And he did. And I get the same feeling watching this that I get from reading a high heat romance. There\u2019s nothing different about it, it\u2019s all right there. I think that\u2019s really brave.",
      "I\u2019m constantly blown away by the fearless performances that Connor and Hudson have given us. But I do think this could be a big change for the way that romance gets filmed, but also maybe the way that romance as a genre gets viewed. I\u2019ve seen quite a few people online, especially men, who didn\u2019t seem to know that these books had this much sexiness in them. They assumed they were sort of Hallmark level. If they think that this is a very compelling study of a relationship \u2014 that\u2019s what romance is. It\u2019s deep character work, it\u2019s a study. I hope that people learn that and think about it more because there\u2019s some great writing in the romance genre and I don\u2019t think it gets respected very much. So God love Jacob Tierney for changing that.",
      "Yeah, but it\u2019s important to the story. It has to be because Scott is the ripple effect. I really love what Jacob did with this episode, and it was one of the first things he described to me about his vision when we spoke on the phone the first time \u2014 he really wanted to do this, this bottle episode.",
      "I know people are a little bit like, \u201cBut Shane and Ilya,\u201d but honestly, it\u2019s so good and it\u2019s so important to their story. And you\u2019ll see why later if you haven\u2019t read the books, it\u2019s all going to make sense.",
      "Yes, it is a huge risk to take the third episode of a six-episode series and make it about different characters. But I do think it was the right decision, and I really am proud of this episode, and I hope people like it. It really is a great, great episode, and I think it just enhances the overall story. And it\u2019s very sexy, if that helps.",
      "I was really touched that Jacob wanted to include that. Obviously, that\u2019s my first book. So sometimes, you think that one can be left out. But I mean, he took the best parts of it and made it into a nice episode, which I really liked.",
      "I was nervous about watching it the first time, because I think everybody has negative feelings about their first book. I always wish I could go back and and redo it, but that\u2019s kind of what happened here. Jacob took it and condensed it, and I was like, oh, it\u2019s pretty good when you cut out all the stuff that I don\u2019t like. (Laughs.)",
      "Nope. That had to be changed.",
      "I\u2019ll say this \u2014 their first time having intercourse, the decision was made to move that to the second episode to not have everything in the first episode. So because of that, the snowstorm was added to the first episode to delay their meeting. And then the Vegas rooftop happened. And then, yes, two seasons go by where Ilya is just relentlessly texting Shane.",
      "In the book, they are hooking up at that time because they\u2019ve already had intercourse. But obviously we can\u2019t skip that first time. Jacob said this is all my fault, because I didn\u2019t describe what happened in those two seasons in the book. But I was like, no, it\u2019s your fault for moving it to the second episode.",
      "That\u2019s really probably one of the biggest changes. There\u2019s not too many big changes, but that was just mainly just because of that weird kind of having to move that scene to the second episode.",
      "I have story ideas for them that I\u2019ve been working on. They never leave my head. I think my other characters do, but those guys stay with me.",
      "I definitely left them in \u201cThe Long Game\u201d at kind of an interesting point that probably people would like to see more of. So I do have story ideas. Some of them I\u2019m working on, I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with them, but there\u2019s going to be something. You\u2019ll see something for sure.",
      "I\u2019m doing OK. It mostly affects the right side of my body, which is my dominant side. So it does make writing and using a computer challenging. It makes signing books challenging. My plan next year is to do a lot, a lot of events, a lot of traveling, all of it, because I can. I\u2019m optimistic, because there\u2019s a lot of new treatments, a lot of talk of a possible cure. I feel like I\u2019m very early stages. I\u2019m 45, and that\u2019s pretty young for Parkinson\u2019s. But for the most part, yeah, I\u2019m mostly fine. I just shake a lot.",
      "It gave me something positive to focus on over the last two years, because otherwise I probably would have gotten very sad, but instead, I\u2019ve just been very excited. And then I thought maybe there\u2019d be an adrenaline drop after the premiere and all that stuff. But it\u2019s just been so fun. The response to the show has been so much bigger than any of us imagined.",
      "Maybe that drop comes next year, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but probably not, because I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll be, like, another season.",
      "New episodes of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d drop Fridays on HBO Max leading up to its season finale on Dec. 26."

      "When the color experts at Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as their 2026 Color of the Year, they predicted the shade would inspire a kind of cool calm.",
      "But the choice of Cloud Dancer, which Pantone described as a \u201cbillowy\u201d white, has instead sparked heated controversy.",
      "People online have blasted the shade for being \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d and possibly not a color at all. After hearing the description of the color read during TODAY\u2019s Dec. 4 unveiling, Al Roker retorted \u201cotherwise known as white.\u201d",
      "Others have denounced Cloud Dancer as tone deaf and \u201cwhite washing,\u201d expressing other controversial takes.",
      "Read on to learn all about the controversy over Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year.",
      "What Is the Pantone Color of the Year?",
      "The Pantone Color Institute has been choosing an annual color of the year since late 1999 when it deemed Cerulean Blue 2000\u2019s Color of the Year, WWD reported. It called the soft blue shade the \u201cColor of the Millennium\u201d and said it inspired hope.",
      "The institute\u2019s color experts \u201ccomb the world looking for new color influences\u201d to choose its star shade each year, according to Pantone\u2019s website.",
      "Each year\u2019s color is influenced by everything from movies and fashion to art and travel destinations, and more. Colors are also inspired by lifestyle trends, new technologies, sports and socio-economic conditions.",
      "Additionally, a Pantone spokesperson tells TODAY.com, \u201cThe Pantone Color of the Year selection process is driven by the color/colors that are bubbling up across design and tying this to the zeitgeist.  The emotional resonance inherent in the color is key to the selection process.\u201d",
      "Other companies like Benjamin Moore and WGSN also choose an annual color of the year. The paint company chose Silhouette AF-655, a \u201cluxurious burnt umber with delicate notes of charcoal\u201d as its 2026 color. WGSN opted for Transformative Teal, the color \u201cfor a period of change and redirection.\u201d",
      "What Is Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year?",
      "When Pantone announced Cloud Dancer as its 2026 pick, it described the color as \u201ca billowy, balanced white\u201d that\u2019s \u201cimbued with a feeling of serenity.\u201d",
      "Like a blank slate, the \u201cethereal\u201d Cloud Dancer is a symbol of a \u201ccalming influence in a frenetic society\u201d and signifies our desire to make a fresh start, the company stated.",
      "The color also hints at \u201cour search for balance between our digital future and our primal need for human connection,\u201d said Laurie Pressman, the Pantone Color Institute\u2019s vice president.",
      "Why Is the Choice Controversial?",
      "Though Pantone described Cloud Dancer as a serene color, it inspired a red-hot response after it was chosen as 2026's Color of the Year.",
      "While some people \u2014 including wedding planners on TikTok \u2014 celebrated the choice, many others found Cloud Dancer oddly bleak, or worse.",
      "\u201cYour choice is about as inspired as mayonnaise,\u201d one person wrote next to Pantone\u2019s announcement about Cloud Dancer on Instagram.",
      "\u201cPantonedeaf,\u201d another added, while one person commented, \u201cIt seems as if this selection, and the content created around it, was conceived in a vacuum completely removed from our collective social and political present. I\u2019d hope a brand that has this much cultural impact wouldn\u2019t operate with such a glaring blind spot.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving unseasoned chicken,\u201d jabbed another.",
      "When a Washington Post reporter asked for feedback about Cloud Dancer in a TikTok video, users didn't hold back.",
      "One person called the color \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cdystopian,\" writing, \u201cThe color of the year is no color. Just another example of the life being sucked out of us all.\u201d",
      "Another said its \u201clack of color\u201d was a \u201crecession indicator,\u201d joking, \u201cPantone can\u2019t afford color this year and neither can anyone else.\u201d",
      "With headlines all year reporting on the rise of white nationalism in the United States, many critics saw the choice of Cloud Dancer as either \u201ctone deaf\u201d or biased.",
      "\u201cSO\u2026 you all sat down and had some meetings. Rolled around some ideas. And in all those meetings, not a single one of you\u2026 in this moment where white supremacy is in the news everyday\u2026. thought, \u2018maybe now isn\u2019t the right time for this,\u2019\u201d one person wrote on Pantone\u2019s Instagram.",
      "\u201cWas \u2018klanrobe white\u2019 taken?\u201d added someone else.",
      "How Has Pantone Responded to the Controversy?",
      "Pressman addressed speculation that proclaiming white the color of the year could raise some eyebrows in an interview with Washington Post.",
      "\u201cSkin tones did not factor into this at all,\u201d Pressman said, noting Pantone has been asked similar questions in the past about other color picks. \u201cWith Peach Fuzz and then with Mocha Mousse, people were weighing in and asking if this was about skin tones. And I think we were going, \u2018Wow, really?\u2019 Because for us it\u2019s really about, at such a basic level, what are people looking for that color can hope to answer?\"",
      "During a Dec. 4 launch event, Pantone\u2019s president, Sky Kelley, said she knew Cloud Dancer would be a \u201cpretty controversial\u201d choice.",
      "Pantone\u2019s pick, she said in a speech caught on video by CNET, \u201csparks a conversation about color that everyone can participate in.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt Pantone, we don\u2019t dictate that conversation, we facilitate it.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, a Pantone spokesperson also explained the meaning behind the color\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cCloud Dancer visually represents a space to create, like a blank page ready for you to turn your inspiration into reality,\u201d the spokesperson said, in part. \u201cIt gives us the ability to become receptive both to what can be and what\u2019s ahead as Cloud Dancer suggests the inner peace we feel after clearing the noise around us.\u201d",
      "Explaining that the name plays a major role to \u201cconjure up a feeling,\u201d the spokesperson said that Cloud Dancer \u201creflects a universally shared experience: wherever we are in the world, we all look up to the buoyant clouds for inspiration, wonder, and to spark imagination.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cIn the simple act of looking up, we\u2019re connected by the drifting lightness of clouds. That universality is a huge part of why Cloud Dancer was selected as the Pantone Color of the Year 2026.\u201d"

      "\"Finally, one of my family members, my sissy Chelsea Handler,\" Jenna said. \"We've been waiting for you (to come on the show).\"",
      "Jenna only has one sister, her twin Barbara, who she also affectionately calls sissy, but Handler has long been an honorary member of the family.

    "story": [
      "Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who was awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, will not attend the ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday, the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute said, adding that he did not know where she was.",
      "Machado was set to receive the award in the Norwegian capital at 1 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) in a ceremony attended by Norwegian royalty as well as Latin American leaders including Argentine President Javier Milei and Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa.",
      "\u201cShe is unfortunately not in Norway and will not stand on stage at Oslo City Hall at 1 p.m. when the ceremony starts,\u201d Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the institute and the permanent secretary of the award body, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, according to Reuters.",
      "Asked where she was, Harpviken said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Machado \u201chas done everything in her power to come to the ceremony today,\u201d the Nobel Institute said in a statement. \u201cWe are profoundly happy to confirm that she is safe and that she will be with us in Oslo,\u201d the institute added, without expanding on her exact whereabouts.",
      "Machado, 58, is barred from leaving Venezuela and has spent more than a year in hiding since the authoritarian regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared him the winner in an election last year that was widely criticized as rigged. She had been the opposition\u2019s original candidate against Maduro, but the government prevented her from running.",
      "Authorities in Venezuela, where Machado has been under a decade-long travel ban, have said she will be considered a fugitive if she attempts to travel abroad. She was last seen in public on Jan. 9, when she was briefly detained after appearing with supporters at a protest in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, the day before Maduro was sworn in for his third six-year term.",
      "A news conference in Oslo where Machado was supposed to appear was canceled on Tuesday after a delay of several hours. The Nobel Institute did not say whether the news conference, which laureates traditionally hold the day before the formal award ceremony, would be rescheduled.",
      "\u201cMachado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo, Norway, will be,\u201d it said Tuesday.",
      "Harpviken said the ceremony would still go ahead and that Machado\u2019s daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, would accept the award in her place.",
      "The Nobel Institute did not immediately reply to an emailed request for additional comment.",
      "The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which hands out the annual prize, recognized Machado in October for keeping \u201cthe flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\u201d and for \u201cher tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Machado said at the time that the honor was the \u201cachievement of a whole society.\u201d",
      "But the committee\u2019s decision has come under criticism amid Machado\u2019s support for President Donald Trump\u2019s military buildup in the Caribbean as well as the use of force to remove Maduro. Trump said Tuesday that Maduro\u2019s \u201cdays are numbered,\u201d declining to comment on whether the U.S. might send troops into the oil-rich South American nation.",
      "After being awarded the prize in October, Machado dedicated it in part to Trump, who along with his supporters has openly campaigned for his own Nobel Peace Prize. She has been unwavering in her support for U.S. military actions against the Venezuelan regime, which have included strikes of questionable legality on alleged drug trafficking boats in the nearby Caribbean Sea.",
      "According to the Pentagon, almost 90 people have been killed in 22 strikes in the Caribbean and off Latin America\u2019s Pacific coast. The administration has produced no evidence to support its allegations about the boats or the people on board.",
      "Machado has also supported forceful means to dislodge Maduro, saying the country\u2019s elections are a sham.",
      "\u201cYou cannot have peace without freedom, and you cannot have freedom without strength,\u201d she told NPR a day after winning the prize on Oct. 10.",
      "In a February interview with Donald Trump Jr. Machado said that Maduro was the head of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Her comments came a month after President Trump listed it as a foreign terrorist organization and he has since used this as justification for his strikes and deportation of Venezuelans.",
      "However, the U.S. intelligence community has contradicted the claims that Maduro is directing the gang.",
      "The Norwegian Peace Council, a group of 17 organizations promoting conflict resolution that is separate from the Nobel Committee, said in October that Machado does not \u201calign with the core values\u201d of the council, adding it was not going to hold its annual tradition of honoring the new laureate with a torchlight procession on Wednesday.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cthe Lady of Steel\u201d and \u201cthe Iron Lady,\u201d Machado, an engineer and mother of three, revitalized Venezuela\u2019s opposition, standing up against Maduro\u2019s rule and his government\u2019s crackdown against opposition figures, journalists and civil society at large.",
      "She was barred from running for president against Maduro in July 2024, backing another opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, instead. While Gonz\u00e1lez was recognized as the winner internationally, Maduro claimed victory, resulting in deadly mass protests.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez later sought asylum after a Venezuelan court issued a warrant for his arrest, while Machado was forced into exile inside her own country, fearing retaliation from the Maduro regime.",
      "\u201cDespite serious threats against her life she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions of people,\u201d the Nobel Committee said in its announcement.",
      "Despite holding the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, the collapse of Venezuela\u2019s economy under Maduro has led to pervasive poverty and a mass exodus of Venezuelans that has become the largest displacement crisis in the world."

    "story": [
      "Nuclear facilities were inspected in Japan on Tuesday as authorities assessed the damage from a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, amid warnings of aftershocks and a potentially larger tremblor in the coming days.",
      "As cleanup operations began, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told reporters that an emergency task force was formed to urgently assess damage, according to The Associated Press. \u201cWe are putting people\u2019s lives first and doing everything we can,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 34 people were injured by Monday's earthquake, most of them hit by falling objects as buildings rocked on their foundations, officials said.",
      "Since the initial tremblor struck about 30 miles below the sea surface off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, 20 aftershocks have been recorded, including one of magnitude-6.4, according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA).",
      "Though highly unlikely, a magnitude-8 quake was possible this week, accompanied by a tsunami just east of Tokyo, the JMA said.",
      "After Japan suffered one of its worst natural disasters March 11, 2011, when it was hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, a deadly wall of water slammed through the walls of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, knocking out power supply, including the backup generator, and flooding parts of the facility. Three nuclear reactors melted down, spewing radioactive particles into the air.",
      "Japanese officials found \u201cno abnormalities\u201d at Fukushima, the International Atomic Energy Agency said early Tuesday.",
      "But as inspections were carried out on other nuclear sites, the country's Nuclear Regulation Authority said in a statement that nearly 120 gallons of water spilled from a fuel cooling system at a nuclear fuel processing plant in the city of Aomori near the epicenter of Monday's earthquake.",
      "Nearby, video posted on social media showed plumes of smoke rising from a house in the city, which sits on the northern coast of Japan's main island, Honshu.",
      "The country\u2019s disaster agency said one fire had broken out in Aomori, which was later extinguished.",
      "The JMA also said houses were prone to collapsing in areas where severe shaking occurred.",
      "All tsunami warnings and advisories were also lifted early Tuesday local time after minor waves were recorded hitting the northeastern coast. Officials had earlier issued tsunami warnings of up to 10 feet.",
      "Elsewhere, across the Pacific, no tsunami was expected to hit Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California, according to the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center.",
      "Japan's fire and disaster management agency also lifted all evacuation warnings Tuesday. Earlier, nearly 114,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes.",
      "The agency said that 23 people were injured, including one seriously, in the Aomori prefecture, nine in Hokkaido, and three  in Iwate.",
      "Japan's bullet train services between Fukushima and Aomori had been suspended along with some sections of highways, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Kihara Minoru told reporters Tuesday, adding that power outages were reported in some areas.",
      "Most suspended train services resumed Tuesday afternoon, Japan Railways East said in a statement on X.",
      "Authorities also deployed fire helicopters to assess any damage across several prefectures, including Aomori, Iwate and Miyagi."

      "Less than 24 hours after he reiterated that Ukraine would not cede land to Russia, Zelenskyy met with the pontiff before   holding talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a day after he met with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany in London.",
      "Thanking the pope for the visit and \u201call the attention given to our people,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a post on X that he had invited him to visit Ukraine. \u201cThis would be a powerful signal of support for our people,\u201d he added.",
      "Ukraine was ready to present \"refined\" peace proposals to the U.S. \"in the near future,\" Zelenskyy said in later post Tuesday.",
      "St. Peter\u2019s Basilica was the setting for an iconic photo of Zelenskyy sitting face-to-face with President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the funeral for Leo\u2019s predecessor, Pope Francis, in April.",
      "Some interpreted it as a sign that relations between the two leaders were warming, two months after Zelenskyy\u2019s disastrous visit to the White House, which saw Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastise him and tell him he wasn't grateful enough to the U.S.",
      "But seven months on, peace still appears like a distant prospect, although Zelenskyy said Tuesday on X that peace proposals would be sent to the U.S. in \u201cthe near future.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Ukrainian and European components are now more developed.\u201d",
      "However, he made it clear Monday that Ukraine would not cede any land to Russia. \u201cWe have no legal right \u2014 under Ukrainian law, under our constitution, under international law \u2014 and honestly, we have no moral right, either,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a WhatsApp conversation with journalists.",
      "His Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, has said he wants Ukraine to give up all of it eastern Donbas region, be it diplomatically or by force. Fierce figthing with Ukrainian forces continues in Donetsk, while Russia controls the entirety of Luhansk.",
      "Trump originally approved a 28-point peace plan to end the war that included Ukraine\u2019s ceding its territory, among other demands seen as favoring Russia.",
      "And  in an interview published Tuesday, Trump said there was \u201cno question\u201d that the Kremlin was in a better negotiating position. Moscow has the upper hand on the battlefield and was \u201cmuch stronger\u201d than Ukraine, Trump told Politico, adding that \u201cat some point, size will win, generally.\u201d",
      "He said that he was not ready to walk away from the peace process but that the parties involved have to \u201cplay ball.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Monday that negotiations led by the U.S. had whittled the original 28 points to 20 and that while he believed in Trump\u2019s commitment to ending the war, he did not trust Russia.",
      "While the Americans were pushing for Ukraine to give up territory, \u201cwe, of course, do not want to give up anything \u2014 that is exactly what we are fighting for,\u201d he said. Trump, he added, had \u201chis own vision,\u201d although Ukrainians see \u201cthe details and nuances more deeply.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin said it has not yet been briefed on the most recent round of negotiations between American and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "After his meeting in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Zelenskyy said he had not received a clear answer about what its allies, including the U.S., would be prepared to do in the event of a new Russian aggression."

      "Can children and teenagers be forced off social media en masse? Australia is about to find out.",
      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always referred to this as the first domino, which is why they pushed back,\u201d Julie Inman Grant, who regulates online safety as Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, said at an event in Sydney last week.",
      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m trying to chat to someone, they might say, \u2018Just a minute,\u2019 and they\u2019re doing something on social media,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Canberra.",
      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",
      "If young people are blocked from social media, \u201cwe just don\u2019t learn the life skills and we don\u2019t learn the experience of going through and knowing what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said.",
      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

Zelenskyy said Monday that negotiators were still split over the core issues of territorial concessions and security guarantees.",
      "After having flown to Moscow with a revised version of the proposal, Trump\u2019s team held talks with Ukrainian officials in Miami, but the push from Washington has so far failed to yield a breakthrough.",

      "What began as a power struggle between rival generals more than two years ago has since plunged Sudan into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced millions from their homes, with mass killings leaving bloody sand visible from space and ruined infrastructure.",
      "Sudan \u201cis the largest humanitarian crisis in the world today,\u201d Leni Kinzli, the WFP\u2019s Sudan communications officer, told NBC News on Sunday. \u201cIt can no longer be forgotten or ignored, simply because the severity and the scale is one that has really not been seen at this level.\u201d",
      "At least 21.2 million people \u2014 roughly 45% of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 are now facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the internationally recognized system for assessing famine and food insecurity. Famine conditions have been confirmed in Darfur\u2019s el-Fasher and Kadugli, where \u201cpeople have endured months without reliable access to food or medical care,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has said.",
      "Kinzli described a landscape where even relatively calm areas remain fragile, while other regions edge deeper into hunger. She said WFP can reach 4 million to 5 million people with food and nutrition support each month and has the capacity to assist 8 million, but \u201cthe resources we have available are not keeping pace with the need.\u201d",
      "Aid delivery remains extremely difficult in violence-ridden areas, where conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to shape the crisis.",
      "That includes el-Fasher, which was under siege by the RSF for more than 18 months, during which time \u201cabsolutely no\u201d aid supplies were able to get in, added Kinzli. The RSF eventually overran the Sudanese army\u2019s last major stronghold in Darfur in October.",
      "In South Kordofan, a drone attack by Sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten on Thursday, killing 50 people, including 33 children, according to a local doctors' group.",
      "United Nations aid teams in Sudan issued a joint statement on Thursday warning that the violence \u201cis restricting access to food, medicine and essential supplies, and is limiting farmers\u2019 access to their fields and markets, heightening the risk of famine spreading across the Kordofan states.\u201d",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned: \u201cWe must not allow Kordofan to become another el-Fasher. It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in el-Fasher.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are seeing pretty much the same exact things in the state of South Kordofan,\u201d said Dr. Mohamed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for Sudan Doctors Network. The RSF is \u201cdoing the same siege, the same blockade, they are not allowing food or medicine to get into the cities,\u201d he told NBC News, adding that between Sept. 20 and Oct. 20 of this year, 23 children died from severe malnutrition.",
      "For the past three months, Sudanese civilians have endured RSF attacks, Elsheikh said, including widespread atrocities and human rights violations, with civilians executed arbitrarily and key infrastructure \u2014 such as hospitals, clinics, schools and homes \u2014 deliberately targeted by airstrikes.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network has documented 19 cases of rape committed by RSF forces against women who fled the fighting in el-Fasher and arrived at the al-Afad camp in al-Dabbah, said Elsheikh.",
      "Fighting in Sudan began in April 2023, when the Sudanese military, led by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, clashed with his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti, who leads the RSF.",
      "Both men had previously led counterinsurgency operations against uprisings in the region, a conflict that in 2005 contributed to Omar al-Bashir becoming the first sitting head of state indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.",
      "Burhan and Dagalo were part of the military establishment that ousted al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest. Two years later, they agreed to share power following a coup that brought down the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.",
      "However, their alliance broke down spectacularly over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, full-scale fighting erupted, dragging Sudan deeper into conflict and a humanitarian crisis.",
      "With no resolution in sight, the war is becoming only more entrenched and chaotic, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, told NBC News. What began as a two-sided struggle has splintered into a tangle of local battles, reopening old regional grievances and eroding whatever central authority once existed, she said.",
      "Both sides have shifted \u201cfrom trying to win this war to trying not to lose,\u201d she added, noting that as the fighting regionalizes, it has produced \u201csmaller fronts, smaller conflicts, which has complicated the chain of command,\u201d making even a negotiated ceasefire nearly impossible to enforce.",
      "Nearly 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, and they have been displaced within the country or are living in neighboring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "Funding for the regional response is less than 10% of what is needed, it said, making it impossible to cover basic needs.",
      "But where funding is available, and where fighting has abated, some areas have shown signs of recovery.",
      "Last year, there were 10 areas confirmed to be suffering from famine, said Kinzli, but \u201cnow there are only two.\u201d Around 3.4 million people who were previously at \u201ccrisis\u201d levels are no longer classified as such, reflecting limited stabilization in parts of Khartoum, Al Jazirah and Sennar, where some families have begun to return.",
      "While these gains remain narrow and uneven, and the situation remains dire, \u201cthis shows that when we have access and funding, we can reverse famine and improve the situation,\u201d Kinzli added. \u201cThe humanitarian response can really make a difference if and when we are able to deliver.\u201d"

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As smoke quickly filled the corridors of a 31-story tower in Hong Kong last week, Rhodora Alcaraz found herself trapped alone with a 3-month-old baby.",
      "The 28-year-old migrant worker had arrived in the Chinese territory from the Philippines only a day earlier to work for a family living in a high-rise housing estate. When a massive fire ignited in the middle of the afternoon, tearing across seven of the estate\u2019s eight buildings, Alcaraz shielded the baby in her arms and was rescued by firefighters just in time, along with her employer\u2019s elderly mother.",
      "Hong Kong, an international financial hub of 7.5 million people, is home to hundreds of thousands of domestic helpers like Alcaraz, mostly women from low-income Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.",
      "The bravery of Alcaraz and other domestic helpers during the Nov. 27 blaze at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po, which killed at least 159 people, has put a spotlight on the critical role they play in the city, where they work for low wages and often live in cramped homes alongside employers who heavily rely on them for housework and caregiving.",
      "At least 10 domestic helpers were killed in the fire, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.",
      "\u201cWe are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire,\u201d Chris Sun, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for labor and welfare, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "He added that families of the domestic helpers who died will receive about 800,000 Hong Kong dollars ($100,000) in condolence and compensation payments.",
      "The Tai Po fire, the deadliest in Hong Kong in almost 80 years, has shocked and angered the public amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight. Authorities say the rapid spread of the five-alarm fire was caused by the use of highly flammable materials around the buildings during renovations.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, John Lee, said this week that a judge-led independent committee would be set up to \u201creview\u201d the fire, which displaced thousands of people from their homes. Almost two dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and fraud in separate investigations.",
      "Alcaraz was still recovering in the hospital and was seen wearing purple scrubs and a mask in a picture posted by Philippines Sen. Imee Marcos.",
      "\u201cI salute you, Rhodora, and all overseas foreign workers who continue to sacrifice for their families even while far from home,\u201d she said in a Facebook post Sunday after visiting Alcaraz in the hospital.",
      "While authorities and aid agencies announced several support measures for affected residents, including transitional housing and a donor-supported reconstruction fund that has raised about 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($360 million), the fire creates additional uncertainty for domestic helpers, who live in Hong Kong on dedicated visas and are entitled to far fewer rights than a typical resident.",
      "A helper\u2019s salary starts at about $650 a month.",
      "Even with an additional food allowance of about $160, they still earn below the minimum wage in Hong Kong, which at about $5.40 an hour amounts to $860 a month for a 40-hour workweek. They are also ineligible for permanent residency, which in most cases can be obtained by living in the city for seven years.",
      "Many domestic helpers are mothers themselves, sending most of their earnings to their children back home to support their education.",
      "\u201cThey have deep trauma now. Whenever they pass by the building, they always cry. Some had friends who died in that building,\u201d said Sring Sringatin, a domestic helper in Hong Kong who is chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union.",
      "Sringatin said helpers from Wang Fuk Court were still residing with their employers, either in temporary shelters or alternative housing. Previously, they would often share a room with the family\u2019s children. Now that their employers are homeless, accommodating helpers has become even more difficult, according to Sringatin and other aid workers who have met with affected helpers.",
      "It is also unclear whether employers whose homes have been destroyed will be able to pay their salaries on time, even as the workers \u2014 who are so embedded with families that they often act as the primary caregivers to children and elderly relatives \u2014 continue providing care.",
      "\u201cThey just follow the families if there is care to be given,\u201d said Johannie Tong, a community relations officer for the nonprofit group Mission for Migrant Workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a default for them. The disaster has happened, but they are still working. They don\u2019t have this question, whether I should work,\u201d said Tong, who visited some of the displaced workers over the past week in government-run temporary shelters that journalists could not access.",
      "Before the fire, workers got little time to themselves. In most cases they worked six days a week, meeting fellow workers on Sundays at parks and other public places to sing karaoke, do each other\u2019s nails or enjoy picnics. Now they are not only traumatized, but they may also be facing more pressure at work and feeling isolated at a time when they are far away from their families, Tong and Sringatin said.",
      "\u201cThey are trying their best to perform their duties, but at the same time they need to be strong, because as a domestic worker there is this feeling that they don\u2019t have anyone in here,\u201d Sringatin said.",
      "Tong said her charity was trying to determine what kind of long-term help workers might need, including immigration assistance or support for their families back home. In the short term, she said, there are ample donations at their center in Hong Kong\u2019s Jordan neighborhood, where workers on Monday were sorting through clothes, toiletries, medicines and more.",
      "Mission for Migrant Workers said it had obtained a SIM card for Alcaraz to use to communicate with her family back in the Philippines.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Europe faces \u201ccrunch time\u201d on the war in Ukraine, a former European president told NBC News, as the continent battles internal division, Russian threats and open hostility from the United States.",
      "Leaders on the continent are feeling \u201cgenuine fear and distrust regarding the United States,\u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who led Estonia for a decade until 2016, told NBC News in an interview Thursday. But he also warned that Europe\u2019s internal division \u201cultimately shows the weakness\u201d of the bloc, and he feared what might happen \u201cunless we start getting our act together.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours before European powers held urgent negotiations Friday on how to keep Ukraine\u2019s war effort alive and before President Donald Trump published his National Security Strategy that spelled out in black and white Washington\u2019s dissatisfaction toward many of its partners across the pond.",
      "Trump had already left Europe out of this week\u2019s negotiations between his envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finding itself sidelined, the European Union is trying to formulate its own proposal: using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Even that, however, is facing opposition from Belgium, fearing Russian retaliation.",
      "Putin on Thursday reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met. He spoke after his predecessor, the hawkish Dmitry Medvedev, said using Russian money to aid Ukraine would be tantamount to a \u201ccasus belli\u201d \u2014 or an act justifying war \u2014 a common Kremlin refrain of his during the 45-month conflict.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time, I think, for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d said Ilves, who served two stints as foreign minister before taking Estonia\u2019s top job.",
      "For Europe, this is about more than just Ukraine; they worry any peace that favors Putin will embolden him to attack and meddle elsewhere on the continent, which has seen an uptick in drone incursions and cyberattacks over the past year.",
      "His war machine is making slow progress on the battlefield but suffering heavy casualties. Kyiv, meanwhile, is running low on money and resources, while suffering a manpower shortage and facing allegations of governmental corruption."
