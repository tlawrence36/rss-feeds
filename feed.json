      "Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna\u2019s high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience",
      "SAO PAULO -- Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna's high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience.",
      "The legendary Brazilian driver \u2014 who was killed when his car hit a concrete wall at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 \u2014 is the subject of a six-episode Netflix series that debuts on Nov. 29 and follows him from his early go-kart days to that fatal Sunday afternoon at the Imola track in Italy.",
      "Even three decades after that accident, few F1 figures evoke as much emotion and passion among fans and fellow drivers as Senna, who won three championship titles before his death at the age of 34.",
      "Senna\u2019s complex personality \u2014 he was a saint to his millions of Brazilian fans and a sinner to some critics who deemed his driving style too aggressive \u2014 comes to life through Brazilian actor Gabriel Leone, who embraced the challenge of portraying such a popular figure.",
      "\u201cHe was much more than an F1 driver for us, he became an icon, much beyond his technique and his driving,\u201d Leone told The Associated Press in an interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cHe had this humanity, this honesty. The things he said, his values, it all made him closer to people.\u201d",
      "Senna's life and career had no shortage of made-for-TV moments.",
      "This was a driver who once won a race with his car stuck in sixth gear in front of thousands of raucous fans at the Interlagos track. And who went from fifth position to first in one lap at the 1993 European Grand Prix. And who jumped out of his car during a training session to save the life of a French driver who had crashed.",
      "On the track, his rivalry with French driver Alain Prost was one of the most intense that F1 has ever seen. Off the track, he had some high-profile relationships as well and dated several models, including Elle Macpherson.",
      "\u201cFor me as an actor, the more complex the character is, the better. It is more interesting to build him and live him. And this is quite a character, the biggest hero in Brazil, not only in sport,\u201d Leone said. \u201cAyrton was transcendent, he was more than an F1 driver. That\u2019s a guy who is the hero of great drivers in history, like (Michael) Schumacher and (Lewis) Hamilton.\u201d",
      "Senna won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991 with the McLaren team and moved to Williams in the year he died as the favorite to lift the title again.",
      "For Leone, though, it was also important to portray him as a person who understood his role as a national hero, who advocated for the poor and proudly waved a Brazilian flag from his cockpit during every victory lap.",
      "\u201cHe was not distant, he was close,\" said Leone, who attended a red carpet premiere in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with several other cast members and director Vicente Amorim. \"That\u2019s for Brazilians and non-Brazilians. It was like this, and it still is like this.\u201d",
      "To many international fans, Senna was simply an exceptional talent who was born to be a driver. Even former rival Martin Brundle, now a TV pundit, once likened Senna's ability to find grip on some corners to a dance seemingly innate to a Brazilian.",
      "\u201cIt is a different kind of samba that I could not do,\u201d Brundle has said.",
      "The Netflix series, however, shows some of the hard work and attention to detail that went into Senna becoming a wet-weather master.",
      "The streaming giant \u2014 which reportedly invested more than $170 million in its production \u2014 also takes a bit of liberty with the truth when it comes to building up the animosity between Senna and one of his other real-life antagonists, Jean-Marie Balestre, the French former president of F1's governing body FIA.",
      "Balestre is often accused by fans of aiding his countryman Prost in his rivalry with Senna, including at the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix by stopping the race early before the Brazilian driver could overtake his French rival in the heavy rain. And at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Senna was disqualified in a decision that handed the championship title to Prost.",
      "The Netflix series goes a step further by making Balestre (played by Arnaud Viard) the man responsible for Senna also losing a go-kart title as a youngster, long before he even entered F1.",
      "\u201cIf that was true it would be news to every reporter covering Senna\u2019s story over the last decades,\u201d said Ernesto Rodrigues, who wrote a biography on the three-time F1 champion. \u201cYes, Senna had Balestre working against him many times. But Balestre was an autocrat with other drivers, too. It wasn\u2019t exclusive.\u201d",
      "Prost, played by Matt Mella, goes from being a racing foe to a friend after his retirement in the series just like in real life. The friction between the two as McLaren teammates and then in the title-deciding races in the 1989 and 1990 seasons create some of the best moments of the series for racing fans.",
      "Three of the women in Senna\u2019s life also appear in the series.",
      "Scenes with L\u00edlian de Vasconcellos Souza, who married Senna in 1981 and divorced him the next year, help show how the Brazilian was driven to go into F1 early in his career. Xuxa Meneghel, a wildly popular TV host, is featured for a full episode as the driver\u2019s most important girlfriend. Adriane Galisteu, who was the champion\u2019s girlfriend when he died, appears for less than three minutes.",
      "Senna's importance to today's F1 drivers was on full display at the Brazilian Grand Prix this month, when Hamilton \u2014 the British seven-time F1 champion \u2014 drove one of Senna's old cars around the track as part of the tributes marking the 30th anniversary of his death.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Hamilton said on Nov. 3. \u201cI hope I made Senna proud.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 01:38:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
    "story": [
      "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
      "DENVER -- Amid renewed interest in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey triggered in part by a new Netflix documentary, police in Boulder, Colorado, refuted assertions this week that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of the 6-year-old girl that they are not pursuing.",
      "JonBenet Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family\u2019s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States.",
      "The police comments came as part of their annual update on the investigation, a month before the 28th anniversary of JonBenet\u2019s killing. Police said they released it a little earlier because of the increased attention on the case, apparently referring to the three-part Netflix series \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the department welcomes news coverage and documentaries about the killing of JonBenet, who would have been 34 this year, as a way to generate possible new leads. He said the department is committed to solving the case but needs to be careful about what it shares about the investigation to protect a possible future prosecution.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you though, is we have thoroughly investigated multiple people as suspects throughout the years and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,\" he said.",
      "The Netflix documentary focuses on the mistakes made by police and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d surrounding the case.",
      "JonBenet was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.",
      "Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet's clothing that pointed to the involvement of an \u201cunexplained third party\u201d in her slaying.",
      "The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys \u201cvictims of this crime.\u201d",
      "John Ramsey has continued to speak out for the case to be solved. In 2022, he supported an online petition asking Colorado\u2019s governor to intervene in the investigation by putting an outside agency in charge of DNA testing in the case. In the Netflix documentary, he said he has been advocating for several items that have not been prepared for DNA testing to be tested and for other items to be retested. He said the results should be put through a genealogy database.",
      "In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees.",
      "In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn\u2019t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022 noted that some evidence could be \u201cconsumed\u201d if DNA testing is done on it.",
      "Last year, police said they convened a panel of outside experts to review the investigation to give recommendations and determine if updated technologies or forensic testing might produce new leads. In the latest update, Redfearn said that review had ended but that police continue to work through and evaluate a \u201clengthy list of recommendations\u201d from the panel.",

    "story": [
      "Angelina Jolie glides through the final days of Maria Callas in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria.\"",
      "Angelina Jolie glides through the final days of Maria Callas' short life in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria,\u201d a dramatic, evocative elegy to the famed soprano. It\u2019s an affair that\u2019s at turns melancholy, biting and grandly theatrical, an aria for a once in a generation star.",
      "Reality is of little consequence on the stage and in \u201cMaria.\u201d It\u2019s all about the raw feeling, which serves the movie well, more dream than history lesson about La Callas. Early on, she pops some Mandrax and tells her devoted butler Ferruccio (a simply wonderful Pierfrancesco Favino) that a television crew is on the way. Are they real, he wonders.",
      "\u201cAs of this morning, what is real and what is not real is my business,\u201d she says calmly and definitively, making a feast out of Steven Knight\u2019s sharp script. It\u2019s one of many great lines and moments for Jolie, whose intensity and resolve belie her fragile appearance. And it\u2019s a signal to the audience as well: Don\u2019t fret about dull facts or that Jolie doesn\u2019t really resemble Callas all that much. This is a biopic as opera \u2014 an emotional journey fitting of the great diva, full of flair, beauty, betrayal, revelations and sorrow.",
      "In \u201cMaria,\u201d we are the companion to a protagonist with an ever-loosening grip on reality, walking with her through Paris, and her life, for one week in September 1977.",
      "The images from cinematographer Ed Lachman, playfully shifting in form and style, take us on a scattershot journey through her triumphs on stage, her scandalous romance with Aristotle Onassis (Haluk Bilginer) and her traumatic youth. In the present, at age 53, she sleeps till midday, drinks the minimal calories she ingests, goes to restaurants where the waiters know her name looking for adulation and has visions of performances staged just for her all around the city.",
      "Callas is always immaculately dressed and assured, whether reflecting to the imagined news crew (led by Kodi Smit-McPhee) or attempting to find her voice again. Her instrument had famously diminished, leaving her wondering what\u2019s left to live for. The only consistent praise she gets is from her obedient housemaid Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher). It\u2019s no secret that the destination is death. And you suspect that she knows quite well that everything will be a big dimmer when her spotlight is turned off.",
      "Larra\u00edn has made a lasting mark on cinema with his unofficial trilogy about these famous women with tragic narratives. With \u201cJackie,\u201d\u201cSpencer\u201d and now \u201cMaria,\u201d his films are also an unintentional antidote to Ryan Murphy\u2019s stranglehold of the grand dames of recent history, which are all style and scandal and little substance. And yet Larra\u00edn's films are not for everyone. If \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cSpencer\u201d did not speak to you, did not show those women as you hoped they would, \u201cMaria\u201d will not turn you into a believer. Three movies in, it seems that audiences are either very on board with his vision or not. There is little room for an in between.",
      "And yet it's hard to deny that his films are incredible showcases for actors. Jolie as a movie star is somehow both omnipresent and elusive, and lately she chooses to step in front of the camera all too infrequently. Sometimes you wish she could just follow in Nicole Kidman\u2019s footsteps, for whom quantity does not seem to ever jeopardize quality, and she seems to be having fun doing it all, all the time. Perhaps it\u2019s because performances like Jolie\u2019s in \u201cMaria\u201d look so all-consuming.",
      "In the film, Maria scolds a fan for daring to question that she faked sickness to miss a performance. He doesn\u2019t understand the total commitment of body and soul required to make it look effortless, which is probably true. Jolie is not so dramatic, at least publicly, about what it takes to create art. But here the lines blur: Character and actor blend so seamlessly, so ferociously, that you leave not just with heightened empathy for La Callas but Jolie as well.",
      "In one of the film\u2019s few regrettable scenes, she\u2019s put face to face with John F. Kennedy (no fault of Caspar Phillipson), whose wife has caught the greedy eye of Onassis. As a testament to the power of Jolie and the script, you almost forgive yet another JFK impersonation for giving her one of the great brushoffs to utter, romantic and withering all at once. Is it all a little much? Of course, but that\u2019s kind of the point of Maria.",
      "\u201cMaria,\u201d a Netflix release in select theaters now and streaming Dec. 11, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201ca sexual reference, some language.\u201d Running time: 122 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. They accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",

      "The move comes 18 months after a Los Angeles County judge threw out much of the 2022 suit in which Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, claimed Wood had fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to fabricate their own allegations.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of fighting a battle where he was able to tell the truth, Brian is pleased to dismiss his still-pending claims and appeal in order to close the door on this chapter of his life,\" Manson attorney Howard King said in a statement.",
      "Manson had been appealing the judge's decision but his attorneys reached out to Wood's seeking a settlement in the spring. Wood's attorneys said Tuesday that she rejected requests that the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Manson \u201cfiled a lawsuit against Ms. Wood as a publicity stunt to try to undermine the credibility of his many accusers and revive his faltering career,\u201d Wood\u2019s lawyer Michael J. Kump said in a statement. \u201cBut his attempt to silence and intimidate Ms. Wood failed.\u201d",
      "Manson agreed to pay nearly $327,000 in attorney fees for Wood.",
      "The settlement comes nearly four years into a criminal investigation of the 55-year-old Manson involving multiple women that remains unresolved. Outgoing LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in October that his office's sex crimes division had just discovered new evidence and that a decision on whether to file charges would be made when the picture was more complete.",
      "The women involved in the criminal case have not been identified, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esme Bianco has said she was among them, and criticized the district attorney for taking so long to investigate. Bianco settled her own lawsuit against Manson last year.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Wood and Bianco have.",
      "Manson has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual acts.",
      "In 2017, with the #MeToo movement gaining momentum, Wood said publicly that she had been raped and abused, and gave testimony on the subject to a Congressional committee in 2018, but did not name anyone in either instance.",
      "Then in a 2020 Instagram post, Wood said it was Manson who had \u201chorrifically abused me for years.\u201d The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "Manson's original lawsuit alleged that Wood and another woman, Ashley Gore, also known as Illma Gore in court papers, defamed him, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say. The suit said Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denied forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.",
      "Other parts of the lawsuit had remained because they were not subject to Wood\u2019s motion, including allegations that Gore hacked Manson\u2019s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was sending illegal pornography, and \u201cswatted\u201d him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.",
      "Gore's part of the lawsuit was dismissed and Manson paid $130,000 in her attorney fees."

      "Some of the biggest performers in music \u2014 including Jelly Roll, Megan Thee Stallion, Ed Sheeran, Kane Brown, Peso Pluma and Lil Baby \u2014 have graced the live stage during the weekly concert series in Los Angeles that airs after the NFL's \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d game on Prime Video. Each show is a unique experience with artists debuting new music on bespoke sets created to bring their vision and style to life.",
      "This season's highlights have included J Balvin 's Latin vibe, Halsey 's Halloween circus intro and Gunna's big money talk. Big Sean was joined onstage by North Carolina A&T State University\u2019s marching band, and Jhene Aiko, YG and E-40 made guest appearances.",
      "Now, it's Snoop Dogg 's turn to take the mic for \u201cAML's\u201d season finale this week, just ahead of his highly anticipated 20th album, \u201cMissionary,\u201d dropping next month. The performances are filmed live in front of more than a thousand audience members and streamed on Prime Video and Amazon's streaming platform, Twitch.",
      "Jelly Roll, a Grammy-nominated country singer, was the \u201cAML\u201d season opener in October just days after the release of his 10th studio album, \u201cBeautifully Broken.\u201d His special guests included Keith Urban, Skylar Grey and Machine Gun Kelly.",
      "\u201cWe could have planned our whole rollout around this,\u201d Jelly Roll said. \u201cI\u2019m always excited to try to share what I do in front of new audiences or hope a new audience sees it or maybe the people at home who couldn\u2019t see the tour or people who bought the album and see what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Last week, TWICE expanded their brand beyond their usual K-pop fandom after the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers. The nine-member group made Amazon Music history. The concert livestream earned the most unique viewers of any production \u2014 including Kendrick Lamar's \u201cPop Out\u201d concert in June, and the Ye and Drake \u201cFree Larry Hoover\u201d show in 2021.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normally used to performing just for our fans who are purposely coming to see us \u2014 especially in the U.S. where we are used to doing that,\u201d said singer Nayeon, who was accompanied by group members Momo, Tzuyu, Mina, Minatozaki Sana, Dahyun, Jihyo, Jeongyeon and Chaeyoung.",
      "TWICE has performed inside major stadiums like MetLife and SoFi Stadium. But \u201cAML\u201d helped introduce them to first-time listeners, while also promoting their upcoming 14th mini-album \u201cStrategy,\u201d releasing Dec. 6.",
      "\u201cFor \u2018Amazon Music Live,\u2019 it\u2019s not just about our fans, but it\u2019s rather related to football,\u201d Nayeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of football fans to see us. To be invited here to perform is such an honor. We need to keep our game card for people to know who TWICE is.\u201d",
      "Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the concert series comes to life and those who play a key role.",
      "When Jelly Roll first entered the \u201cAML\u201d set, the singer thought it was just another rehearsal \u2014 until he found himself immersed in an unexpected interactive experience before stepping on the main stage.",
      "\u201cI was overwhelmed. Got nervous,\u201d said Jelly Roll, who was floored after he initially walked through the Tailgate Experience at the East End Studios in Glendale, California, where \u201cAML\u201d films season three.",
      "The experience offers a variety of attractions including flat-screen TVs above a massive circular bar, a spacious VIP section, photo booth, themed locker room, digital bonfire, featured vehicle, jersey patch station and a towering football toss game. All of this is set to the music of the week's concert series performer blasted through loudspeakers.",
      "\u201cI wanted a space that was intentional and inclusive to everybody,\u201d said Jameka Pankey, the head of events and experiential for artists at Amazon Music. She and her team wanted to make a concerted effort to pay homage to performers and the fans who enjoy their work.",
      "\u201cWe thought about all aspects of football and tailgating from fellowship, food and even how we were naming the drinks,\u201d Pankey said. \u201cWhen we were giving away gifts to fans. ... We had to do jerseys. I wanted this to be a fan experience that was out of mind.\u201d",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "At Amazon Music, collaboration has fueled success with departments joining forces to lock in the hottest talent of the week.",
      "But predicting a year out? That's a tough play when album releases are anyone's guess. They use their label connections and instincts to keep them ahead of the game and ready to pivot and lockdown the artist with the next big release.",
      "\u201cWe try to really be as genre agnostic and diverse as possible,\u201d said Kirdis Postelle, global head of content and artist marketing at Amazon Music. She works with Andrew Sexton, who handles booking for \u201cAML.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur team, along with myself, are active in conversations about this program,\u201d said Sexton, who is considered a label relations guru. Some of the selling points to attract artists have been to capitalize off the NFL's huge viewership, promote their project and perform with top-notch production.",
      "\u201cWe're very active,\" he said. \"We're always in communications with artist's teams and people are reaching out to us too. ... We're in constant conversations with the industry.\"",
      "Following a high-stakes \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d matchup is plenty of pressure. But pulling off a live major concert after a big NFL showdown? That\u2019s next-level intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge which is fungible start time,\u201d said Ed Walker, the head of video studios at Amazon Music. He played an integral role in the concert series moving from a shared studio lot in Hollywood to now filming at East End Studios \u2014 a complex with more than 96,000-square-feet of space, including two soundstages, a rooftop terrace, green rooms and three stories of office space.",
      "After the game wraps, there\u2019s an hour preshow on Twitch and a top-of-show segment that takes audiences into the artist\u2019s world. The hope is to create a \u201ccloser connection\u201d before their performance, introducing more insight into the artist\u2019s project. There are sweepstakes and competitions to maintain intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe immerse them into what they are about to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a moving target. You have a very large audience watching football, and then we have direct communications to the control room broadcasting that and they are giving us real time updates.\u201d",
      "Walker admits it\u2019s a tough balancing act, keeping the football audience engaged while also entertaining \u201cAML\u201d viewers before the show kicks off.",
      "\u201cWe got to meet in the middle, entertain them all, give them context and start the show,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile all that\u2019s happening, we have to make sure the artist is on the stage and hits the cue on time.\u201d",
      "While artists are rehearsing, Postelle wants to make sure they\u2019re comfortable and don't leave. That led to the idea of an artist experience with food, games, drinks and privacy.",
      "\u201cWe do that to make artists feel good about spending so much time here,\u201d Postelle said. \u201cThe last thing you want is for somebody to be like \u2018I\u2019m going back to the hotel to take a shower\u2019 and they fall asleep. Then we\u2019ll have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Each week, select customers in the Los Angeles area are invited to purchase $15 tickets for that week's performance during an exclusive superfan presale or general onsale. Live events company DICE tracks upcoming events and uses audience targeting based on fan interests to notify potential attendees."

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail as he awaits a May sex trafficking trial",
      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was denied bail on Wednesday as he awaits a May sex trafficking trial by a judge who cited evidence showing him to be a \u201cserious risk\u201d of witness tampering and proof he has tried to hide prohibited communications with third parties while incarcerated.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled in a five-page order following a bail hearing last week. At the hearing, lawyers for the hip-hop mogul argued that a $50 million bail package they proposed would be sufficient to ensure Combs doesn\u2019t flee and doesn\u2019t try to intimidate prospective trial witnesses.",
      "Two other judges previously had agreed with prosecutors that the Bad Boy Records founder was a danger to the community if he is not behind bars. Subramanian concurred.",
      "\u201cThere is compelling evidence of Combs's propensity for violence,\u201d Subramanian wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the decision. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for prosecutors, declined comment.",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees. An indictment alleges that he silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "A federal appeals court judge last month denied Combs\u2019 immediate release while a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan considers his bail request. That appeal was put on hold while Subramanian, newly appointed to the case after an earlier judge stepped aside, considered the bail request for the first time.",
      "Subramanian said he took a fresh look at all the bail arguments and the evidence supporting them to make his decision.",
      "Prosecutors have insisted that no bail conditions would be sufficient to protect the public and prevent the \u201cI'll Be Missing You\u201d singer from fleeing.",
      "They say that even in a federal lockup in Brooklyn, Combs has orchestrated social media campaigns designed to influence prospective jurors and tried to publicly leak materials he thinks can help his case. They say he also has contacted potential witnesses through third parties.",
      "Lawyers for Combs say any alleged sexual abuse described in the indictment occurred during consensual relations between adults and that new evidence refutes allegations that Combs used his \u201cpower and prestige\u201d to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "Subramanian said evidence shows Combs to be a \u201cserious risk of witness tampering,\u201d particularly after he communicated over the summer with a grand jury witness and deleted some of his texts with the witness.",
      "The judge also cited evidence showing that Combs violated Bureau of Prisons regulations during pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn when he paid other inmates to use their phone code numbers so he could make calls to individuals who were not on his approved contact list.",
      "He said there was also evidence that he told family members and defense counsel to add other people to three-way calls so their communications would be more difficult to trace and that he made efforts to influence his trial's jury pool or to reach potential witnesses.",
      "Subramanian said his \u201cwillingness to skirt\u201d jailhouse rules to conceal communications was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that any conditions of release would not prevent similar behavior.",
      "The judge said defense claims that Combs stopped using one particular phone technique criticized by prosecutors was belied by the fact that Combs apparently used it again on Sunday, two days after his bail hearing last week.",
      "Even a bail proposal that would include the strictest form of home confinement seemed insufficient, the judge said.",
      "\u201cGiven the nature of the allegations in this case and the information provided by the government, the Court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ \u2014 like a private security detail \u2014 to follow those conditions,\u201d Subramanian wrote."

      "The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicked off Thursday in New York City with a steady rain adding ponchos and umbrellas to the lineup of balloons, floats and star-studded performances",
      "NEW YORK -- The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was drenched in rain Thursday and briefly disrupted by Pro-Palestinian demonstrators.",
      "New York City police said they arrested 21 people after protesters sat down on the parade route with Palestinian flags and a \u201cDon't Celebrate Genocide\u201d banner.",
      "People protesting Israel's war in Gaza also interrupted last year\u2019s parade.",
      "Thanks to the wet weather, this year\u2019s parade saw lots of ponchos and umbrellas along with the usual lineup of giant balloons, floats and star-studded performances.",
      "The latest edition of the annual holiday tradition featured new Spider-Man and Minnie Mouse balloons, zoo and pasta-themed floats, an ode to Big Apple coffee and bagels, performances from Jennifer Hudson, Idina Menzel and Kylie Minogue, and more.",
      "The lineup was a far cry from the parade\u2019s initial incarnation a century ago, which featured floats showing scenes from Mother Goose, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Miss Muffet and the Spider, and other fairy tales.",
      "Some things remained the same, though. As in 1924, there are plenty of marching bands and lots of clowns, followed by the grand finale of Santa Claus riding through Manhattan and ushering in the holiday season.",
      "This year's parade featured 17 giant, helium-filled character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups, award-winning singers and actors, and the WNBA champion New York Liberty.",
      "Other highlights included reality TV star Ariana Madix, hip-hop\u2019s T-Pain, country duo Dan + Shay, The War and Treaty, The Temptations, Jimmy Fallon & The Roots, Broadway veteran Lea Salonga, and \u201cGlow\u201d actor and Macy's spokesperson Alison Brie.",
      "One new float spotlighted the Rao\u2019s food brand, featuring a knight and a dragon in battle made with actual pasta elements. Another celebrated the Bronx Zoo\u2019s 125th anniversary with representations of a tiger, a giraffe, a zebra and a gorilla.",
      "\u201cThe work that we do, the opportunity to impact millions of people and bring a bit of joy for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning, is what motivates us every day,\u201d said Will Coss, Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade executive producer.",
      "The parade began at 8:30 a.m. on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side and ends 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) away around noon at Macy\u2019s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances.",
      "The rain isn't stopping anything \u2014 the parade has only been canceled three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II \u2014 but organizers are monitoring wind speeds throughout the festivities to make sure it\u2019s safe for the big balloons to fly.",
      "Temperatures are in the upper 40s degrees F, with rain throughout the morning and winds around 10 mph (16 kph), well within the acceptable range for letting Snoopy, Bluey and their friends soar. New York City law prohibits Macy\u2019s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph (37 kph) or wind gusts are over 35 mph (56 kph).",
      "The parade airs on NBC with hosts Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker and streams on the network's Peacock service. Carlos Adyan and Andrea Meza will host a Spanish simulcast on Telemundo."

      "The tradition goes back to the pre-World War I days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when former soldiers set up mobile cookshops to make a living. The city\u2019s longest-lived stall in a fixed location, W\u00fcrstelstand Leo, has been serving up sausages since 1928. The stands developed into a bigger institution after wider-ranging permission for fixed stalls was granted in 1969.",

      "The two-minute open features the original Madden Cruiser traveling from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, to Lambeau Field last week. It has remained in Green Bay and will also be featured during the game.",
      "Lambeau Field was always one of Madden\u2019s favorite stadiums, which made this year\u2019s Thanksgiving game on NBC game even more special.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been unbelievable to see the way John\u2019s legacy is still so important and prevalent,\u201d said Ellie Wright, who produced the opening and was on the trip last week.",
      "The idea of bringing the bus out of retirement first came up during NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d production meetings in early June. Madden donated the Madden Cruiser to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.",
      "The Hall was all in on the idea of the cruiser taking one final ride around the Midwest. It is a featured attraction during enshrinement week activities, but most of the year, it is stored in a warehouse in northeast Ohio.",
      "On its trip through the Midwest, the cruiser also went through Chicago, where it made a brief stop at Soldier Field and a Boys & Girls Club in Wisconsin before reaching Lambeau Field.",
      "J.J. Johnson, who drove for Madden for the final six years of his broadcast career (2003-08), drove the cruiser last week and narrated the opening.",
      "\u201cAs I was driving between locations, the crew would ask me questions, or I\u2019d share stories, and it just brought back so many fond memories. And, for me, it\u2019s honoring John in this way,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "After having a panic attack on a flight before calling a game at Tampa Bay in 1979, Madden would travel to games via train before Greyhound donated the first bus in 1987.",
      "The first Madden Cruiser traveled more than 600,000 miles. It was replaced with an upgraded one in 1994 when Madden went from CBS to Fox.",

      "Madden called 20 Thanksgiving games on CBS and Fox from 1982 through 2001. He went to ABC for \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in 2002 and joined NBC in 2006 when \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d started, but neither network had a game on Thanksgiving.",
      "CBS has the first game, between the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions, and Fox has the late afternoon matchup between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The NFL expanded to three Thanksgiving games in 2006. NBC took over broadcasting the night game in 2012.",
      "This is the second time Green Bay has hosted the night game and the first since 2015.",
      "Even though Madden retired from broadcasting after Super Bowl 43 at the end of the 2008 season, his impact on NBC\u2019s games continues to resonate.",
      "\u201cSunday Night Football\u201d coordinating producer Rob Hyland, who was Madden\u2019s replay producer when NBC got back NFL rights in 2006, said Madden had a significant role in his development in terms of being a storyteller, not only with football but in producing the Kentucky Derby and prime-time coverage of the Olympics.",
      "\u201cJohn Madden was the most curious person I\u2019ve ever worked with, and I think his curiosity has definitely rubbed off on anyone that\u2019s worked with him,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cHow a player\u2019s ankles are taped may look different than the previous week. He would question a lot, and I discovered a lot because of his curiosity.\u201d",

      "Hall of Fame safety Leroy Butler, who played for the Packers for 12 seasons, has become an accomplished chef and will prepare the turkeys and turduckens, with some being done on the bus.",
      "\u201cOne of our production trucks has a dedication to John on the outside of it.

      "Angelina Jolie never expected to hit all the notes",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie never expected to hit all the notes. But finding the breath of Maria Callas was enough to bring things out of Jolie that she didn\u2019t even know were in her.",
      "\u201cAll of us, we really don\u2019t realize where things land in our body over a lifetime of different experiences and where we hold it to protect ourselves,\u201d Jolie said in a recent interview. \u201cWe hold it in our stomachs. We hold it in our chest. We breathe from a different place when we\u2019re nervous or we\u2019re sad.",
      "\u201cThe first few weeks were the hardest because my body had to open and I had to breathe again,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd that was a discovery of how much I wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria,\u201d which Netflix released in theaters Wednesday before it begins streaming on Dec. 11, Jolie gives, if not the performance of her career, then certainly of her last decade. Beginning with 2010\u2019s \u201cIn the Land of Blood and Honey,\u201d Jolie has spent recent years directing films while prioritizing raising her six children.",
      "\u201cSo my choices for quite a few years were whatever was smart financially and short. I worked very little the last eight years,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cAnd I was kind of drained. I couldn\u2019t for a while.\u201d",
      "But her youngest kids are now 16. And for the first time in years, Jolie is back in the spotlight, in full movie-star mode. Her commanding performance in \u201cMaria\u201d seems assured of bringing Jolie her third Oscar nomination. (She won supporting actress in 2000 for \u201cGirl, Interrupted.\u201d) For an actress whose filmography might lack a signature movie, \u201cMaria\u201d may be Jolie's defining role.",
      "Jolie's oldest children, Maddox and Pax, worked on the set of the film. There, they saw a version of their mother they hadn't seen before.",
      "\u201cThey had certainly seen me sad in my life. But I don\u2019t cry in front of my children like that,\u201d Jolie says of the emotion Callas dredged up in her. \u201cThat was a moment in realizing they were going to be with me, side by side, in this process of really understanding the depth of some of the pain I carry.\u201d",
      "Jolie, who met a reporter earlier this fall at the Carlyle Hotel, didn't speak in any detail of that pain. But it was hard not to sense some it had to do with her lengthy and ongoing divorce from Brad Pitt, with whom she had six children.",
      "Just prior to meeting, a judge allowed Pitt\u2019s remaining claim against Jolie, over the French winery Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, to proceed. On Monday, a judge ruled that Pitt must disclose documents Jolie\u2019s legal team have sought that they allege include \u201ccommunications concerning abuse.\u201d Pitt has denied ever being abusive.",
      "The result of the U.S. presidential election was also just days old, though Jolie \u2014 special envoy for the United Nations Refugee Agency from 2012 to 2022 \u2013 wasn\u2019t inclined to talk politics. Asked about Donald Trump\u2019s win, she responded, \u201cGlobal storytelling is essential,\u201d before adding: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on. Listening. Listening to the voices of people in my country and around the world.\u201d",
      "Balancing such things \u2014 reports concerning her private life, questions that accompany someone of her fame \u2014 is a big reason why Jolie is so suited to the part of Callas. The film takes place during the American-born soprano\u2019s final days. (She died of a heart attack at 53 in 1977.) Spending much of her time in her grand Paris apartment, Callas hasn\u2019t sung publicly in years; she\u2019s lost her voice. Imprisoned by the myth she\u2019s created, Callas is redefining herself and her voice. An instructor tells her he wants to hear \u201cCallas, not Maria.\" The movie, of course, is more concerned with Maria.",
      "It\u2019s Larrain\u2019s third portrait of 20th century female icon, following \u201cJackie\u201d (with Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy) and \u201cSpencer\u201d (with Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana). As Callas, Jolie is wonderfully regal \u2014 a self-possessed diva who deliciously, in lines penned by screenwriter Steven Knight, spouts lines like: \u201cI took liberties all my life and the world took liberties with me.\u201d",
      "Asked if she identified with that line, Jolie answered, \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Then she took a long pause.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure people will read a lot into this and there\u2019s probably a lot I could say but don\u2019t want to feed into,\u201d Jolie eventually continues. \u201cI know she was a public person because she loved her work. And I\u2019m a public person because I love my work, not because I like being public. I think some people are more comfortable with a public life, and I\u2019ve never been fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "When Larra\u00edn first approached Jolie about the role, he screened \u201cSpencer\u201d for her. That film, like \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cMaria,\u201d eschews a biopic approach to instead intimately focus on a specific moment of crisis. Larra\u00edn was convinced Jolie was meant for the role.",
      "\u201cI felt she could have that magnetism,\u201d Larra\u00edn says. \u201cThe enigmatic diva that\u2019s come to a point in her life where she has to take control of her life again. But the weight of her experience, of her music, of her singing, everything, is on her back. And she carries that. It\u2019s someone who\u2019s already loaded with a life that\u2019s been intense.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a loneliness that we both share,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I think people can be alone and lonely sometimes, and that can be part of who they are.\u201d",
      "Larra\u00edn, the Chilean filmmaker, grew up in Santiago going to the opera, and he has long yearned to bring its full power and majesty to a movie. In Callas, he heard something that transfixed him.",
      "\u201cI hear something near perfection, but at the same time, it\u2019s something that\u2019s about to be destroyed,\u201d Larra\u00edn says. \u201cSo it\u2019s as fragile and as strong as possible. It lives in both extremes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so moving. I hear a voice that\u2019s about to be broken, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In Callas\u2019 less perfect moments singing in the film, Larra\u00edn fuses archival recordings of Callas with Jolie\u2019s own voice. Some mix of the two runs throughout \u201cMaria.\u201d \u201cEarly in the process,\u201d Jolie says, \u201cI discovered that you can\u2019t fake-sing opera.\u201d",
      "Jolie has said she never sang before, not even karaoke. But the experience has left her with a newfound appreciation of opera and its healing properties.",
      "\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s something you lean into as you get older,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cMaybe your depth of pain is bigger, your depth of loss is bigger, and that sound in opera meets that, the enormity of it.\u201d",
      "If Larra\u00edn\u2019s approach to \u201cMaria\u201d is predicated on an unknowingness, he's inclined to say something similar about his star.",
      "\u201cBecause of media and social media, some people might think that they know a lot about Angelina,\u201d he says. \u201cMaria, I read nine biographies of her. I saw everything. I read every interview. I made this movie. But I don\u2019t think I would be capable of telling you who she was us. So if there\u2019s an element in common, it\u2019s that. They carry an enormous amount of mystery. Even if you think that you know them, you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Whether \u201cMaria\u201d means more acting in the future for Jolie, she's not sure. \u201cThere's not a clear map,\u201d she says. Besides, Jolie isn't quite ready to shake Callas.",
      "\u201cWhen you play a real person, you feel at some point that they become your friend,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s still a little personal. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ll be at a premiere or I\u2019ll walk into a room and someone will start blaring her music for fun, but I have this crazy internal sense memory of dropping to my knees and crying.\u201d"

      "Donald Trump is coming back to the White House, but don't expect another \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d or much fire and fury in book publishing in general",
      "NEW YORK -- As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling \u201cFire and Fury\u201d or her own blockbuster, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat else is there to learn?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.\u201d",
      "For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.",
      "Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d former national security adviser John Bolton's \u201cThe Room Where it Happened\u201d and Bob Woodward's \u201cFear.\u201d Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's \u201cA Handmaid's Tale,\u201d which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.",
      "But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family \u2014 they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's \u201cWho Could Ever Love You\u201d and Woodward's \u201cWar\u201d were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been there many times, with all those books,\u201d HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books \u2014 perhaps analyzing the recent election \u2014 because \u201cthere's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,\u201d one that would welcome \u201can intelligent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the reboot of any hit TV show,\u201d says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cYou\u2019re not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it\u2019s replacing.\u201d",
      "In the days following Trump's victory, \u201cThe Handmaid's Tale\u201d and George Orwell's \u201c1984\u201d returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny,\" a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and Hegseth's \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d \u2014 and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.",
      "First lady Melania Trump's memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.",
      "\u201cThe Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,\u201d says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. \u201cAfter Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.\u201d",
      "Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers \u2014 most recently Hachette Book Group \u2014 have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists \u2014 if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.",
      "A new \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a \u201cknown peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.\u201d",
      "A publicist for Wolff said he was declining comment.",
      "Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller \u201cRage,\u201d told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how \u201cout of control he gets,\u201d Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.",
      "\u201cHe wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.\u201d",

      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original, writes Associated Press Film...",
      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original.",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens in theaters Wednesday, was originally put into development as a streaming series before it was rerouted the big screen. Curiously, though, it\u2019s not scale or spectacle lacking here. Directors David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller have made an often dazzlingly animated film that is, visually, a step up from 2016\u2019s \u201cMoana.\u201d",
      "But in a story that brings in a literal boatload of new characters, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that \u201cMoana 2\u201d got caught in the crosswinds \u2014 too blown between shifting studio imperatives to really find its own way.",
      "That\u2019s a shame because the original \u201cMoana\u201d is about the lightest, most joyful animated movie Disney has made in a decade \u2013 with the possible exception of \u201cEncanto,\u201d which likewise bounced to the buoyant rhythms of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. (Miranda is crucially absent in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d though \u201cHamilton\u201d director Thomas Kail is currently developing a live-action \u201cMoana.\u201d)",
      "Photorealistic remakes have been the more dominant providence of the Magic Kingdom in recent years, a trend that\u2019s made more whimsical, imagination-filled animations like \u201cMoana\u201d all the more exceptional. Here was a movie that somehow balanced Pacific Island cultural authenticity with the cartoony delights of a demigod turned accidental shark and Jemaine Clement as a singing, flaunting giant crab. Talk about win win.",
      "Such inventiveness is harder to come by in the perfectly earnest but not especially inspired \u201cMoana.\u201d It opens with a visibly grown Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho, returning) engaged in a search for evidence of Pacific Islanders beyond her home island. She is by now a mythic figure, herself, to her people, idolized by youngsters for her courage and for being \u201csuper-besties\u201d with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson, also back).",
      "When Moana turns up an artifact with evidence of a two-peaked island, Motufetu, fabled as the once binding center of their ancestors, she sets out to find the cursed island and reunite the disparate people of Oceania. This time, though, Moana is sailing with a more crowded boat.",
      "Some of the old sidekicks \u2014 the rooster Heihei (with noises courtesy of Alan Tudyk) and the pig Pua \u2014 are back. But Moana decides she needs human help this time, and brings along a crew featuring the uber Maui fan Moni (Hual\u0101lai Chung), the engineer Loto (Rose Matefeo) and the curmudgeonly older farmer Kele (David Fane).",
      "Each of these characters has one generic note to play, and while you could see the need to add in more personalities for a series (Moana also now has a cute little sister, voiced by Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda), they are effectively dead weight in \u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "To me, the iconic image of these films is Moana as a solo adventurer, leaning against the wind in her camakau and setting an unknown course. Sure, Maui is inevitably her buddy-comedy partner in adventure, but Moana and her canoe should permit passengers no more than John Wayne did on his horse.",
      "After an encounter with the coconut brigade of the Kakamora, Moana and Maui eventually reunite via a giant clam, where Maui has been trapped by Matangai (Awhimai Fraser, having fun), a mysterious, bat-adorned figure who\u2019s a kind of villain for the movie. She\u2019s more interesting than some recent Disney antagonists and gets probably the best song (\u201cGet Lost\u201d) in a movie that mightily misses Miranda\u2019s touch. (The songs are by Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.)",
      "That scene and the climactic one, with a sea of tornadoes spinning across stormy waters, are vividly drawn \u2014 enough, surely, to delight younger moviegoers. Coming fast on the heels of \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the most salient selling points of \u201cMoana 2\u201d may be its comparatively nimble running time. At 100 minutes, it\u2019s a full hour shorter than \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Ironically, \u201cMoana 2\u201d \u2014 beefed up from a would-be series \u2014 has brevity in its favor. But the hopes for \u201cMoana 2\u201d should go beyond mere placeholder. Only a few times does the banter between Moana and Maui really remind you of the fun that characterized the original. In one such moment, Moana corrects Maui after he calls her \u2014 perhaps confusing Moana for many other Disney protagonists \u2014 a princess. His comeback? \u201cWell, a lot of people think you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/peril. Running time: 100 minutes. Two stars out of four."

During the Covid lockdowns, when her kids were confined at home and she had less time to herself, she turned to the short story form. The result, \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d is an astonishingly good debut collection that often incorporates the bizarre, life-altering reality of the pandemic into the plots.",
      "The main characters tend to be 30-something women trying to have it all. Kids, relationships, satisfying careers \u2014 the \u201cseductive slipstream of productivity.\u201d They also strive to be good citizens of an ailing planet and have sex with their partners more than once in a blue moon.",
      "In \u201cComorbidities,\u201d which won the 2023 BBC National Short Story Award, a couple with young children tries to spice up their marriage by making a sex tape. In an abundance of caution, the man pauses the action to read up on digital security and adjust his devices. Hours later, when the glow has worn off, the woman has a panic attack, worrying it might somehow end up in the \u201cdeadly slime of the internet.\u201d",
      "Her female protagonists happen to be a lusty bunch, enjoying sex in flavors that some might consider kinky. But once the little ones arrive, everything changes. Fathers might leave, but these mothers wouldn\u2019t dream of it. \u201cThey\u2019re the grand love affair, in the end. The kids.

      "\u201cRecently, I had started to notice my bad energy, and I began to follow it, wondering where it would take me,\u201d says the main character in \u201cWedding Day.\u201d And where was that? To a scheme to disrupt her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wedding by insisting he leave the party early to bring their daughter home for her bedtime. But revenge is bittersweet because once he is back in the apartment they used to share, she is overcome with painful memories of their powerful erotic attraction.",
      "For all their flaws \u2014 and they have lots of them \u2014 the women in these delectable stories are insanely fun to be with because they are so fully imagined and true to the way we live now.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new stage musical about Louis Armstrong on Broadway opens with the jazz icon in a rehearsal room alongside an anonymous piano player. Keep an eye on the guy on keys.",
      "Audiences may not know it, but there are actually two Armstrongs onstage at that moment \u2014 the actor playing the great trumpeter and one of his real-life descendants. In an act of casting kismet, the piano player is Brandon Louis Armstrong, the music giant's great-great nephew.",
      "\u201cThat moment always feels like I get to \u2014 as Brandon \u2014 speak to my great-great uncle from beyond,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to just spend a moment in conversation with him and ask if he\u2019s OK and hear his voice.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong is making his Broadway debut in \u201cA Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical,\u201d playing multiple parts, including a piano player, a teacher and as an understudy for Louis Armstrong himself.",
      "\u201cI was cautious about how I\u2019d be able to step into this world and connect with part of my family history and my lineage,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful and so thankful and so happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\u201d \u2014 starring Tony Award-winner James Monroe Iglehart and sometimes James T. Lane in the title role \u2014 is a stage bio of one of jazz's most influential figures, a musician know for \u201cHello, Dolly,\u201d \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d and \u201cA Wonderful World.\u201d",
      "The musical looks behind his wide smile to dig into his rise from poverty, his four marriages and battles with racism from the Klansmen of New Orleans to the thugs of Chicago to Hollywood\u2019s bigots. He emerges from it a transcendent force, warts and all.",
      "\u201cThe messaging behind it is that jazz is the choices that we make in between the notes,\u201d says the younger Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making the right choice every time. It\u2019s about making a choice and allowing yourself to be present wherever those choices may lead you.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong was born and raised in Los Angeles. His home was always filled with music, but no one in his immediate family is a musician or wanted to perform.",
      "\u201cI grew up with a lot of jazz playing in the household, a lot of gospel, a lot of R&B, a lot of hip-hop. My mom was also really big into like '80s hair metal bands and stuff like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d go from listening to Motown to like listening to Guns n' Roses and then Kenny Rogers. It just was always a tapestry of music.\u201d",
      "He was enchanted by his high school show choir and got invited to join \u2014 all boys got in because muscles were needed to lift the girls \u2014 and was later stunned by seeing a regional theater production of the classic musical \u201cRagtime.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so moved by it, I just was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m the person sweeping the floors when it\u2019s over. I just want to be a part of whatever that is\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "He graduated from The American Musical and Dramatic Academy and after some local stage work \u2014 including playing Donkey in \u201cShrek\u201d \u2014 landed on the third national tour of \u201cHamilton,\u201d which kicked off in 2019 in Puerto Rico starring Lin-Manuel Miranda.",
      "Armstrong didn't lean into his family name to get ahead. Press interviews when he broke out didn't even mention his famous pedigree. \u201cI never, surprisingly, thought to ever lead with that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this particular show, it's inescapable.\u201d",
      "Iglehart, also a co-director, recalls Armstrong walking into the rehearsal room and stating his name. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018How cool.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m related.\u2019\u201d He got the job based on his voice and acting \u2014 not his name.",
      "\u201cWe really did it on talent,\u201d says Iglehart. \u201cI always feel like who's ever the most talented person for the show, that should be who is in it. But then the fact that it was his lineage, we kind of felt that it was like a sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\" has been a way to honor not only Louis Armstrong but also Brandon's grandfather, Louis Henry Armstrong, who told stories about his proud lineage and would often pick Brandon up after school blasting jazz music, much to his teenage embarrassment.",
      "\u201cI just think in those moments how unbelievably proud he would be of something like this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the best kind of therapy every night.\u201d",
      "While there is an actual Armstrong in the cast, fellow actors and creatives haven't pulled Brandon aside to ask him about what Louis would think about a line or a scene. That's because Louis Armstrong left many rich writings about his thoughts.",
      "\u201cSo much of the heartbeat of what it is that our show is beating with \u2014 and I prefer it this way \u2014 is the heartbeat that\u2019s being told through Louis\u2019 voice, as opposed to someone coming in and arbitrarily putting themselves into him,\" the younger Armstrong said.",
      "In addition to the rehearsal piano player, serving in the ensemble and playing the New Orleans music teacher who recognized Louis Armstrong's talent, Brandon knows that one day he will be asked to go on as his great-great uncle.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern I think when it happens is just trying not to cry all the way through the show,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cSomehow the universe has paved out this road for me that has landed me here, getting to literally take the stage and carry that baton.\"",

      "Long before Donald Trump used the term \u201cfake news\u201d to complain about coverage he didn't like, Orson Welles mastered the art of actual fake news.",
      "Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d is the focus of William Elliott Hazelgrove's \u201cDead Air: The Night That Orson Welles Terrified America.\u201d",
      "The book serves as an enjoyable history of the radio drama, with a fair share of fascinating details about its production and historical context. But it falls short on exploring the legendary reports of mass hysteria among listeners who believed they were hearing an actual Martian invasion unfold.",
      "In appropriately cinematic detail, Hazelgrove chronicles Welles' rise and manic working style \u2014 even including a hilarious account of a scuffle that broke out between Welles and Ernest Hemingway and ended with the pair toasting each other over whiskey.",
      "The book highlights what made Welles' production particularly powerful, airing at a time when millions remained unemployed from the Great Depression and the nation was on edge about the threat of Nazi Germany. He details how Welles took advantage of those fears, including using an actor who sounded like Franklin D. Roosevelt for a part in his broadcast.",
      "\u201cA bottled-up sense of panic was in the air and people could almost smell the fear,\" he writes. \u201cOrson Welles would open that bottle and let the fear run wild.\u201d",
      "The book's biggest flaw is Hazelgrove's exploration of just how wild that fear ran. Hazelgrove too easily dismisses the modern reappraisal that reports of a widespread panic were exaggerated, and shows little skepticism about news accounts from then that were largely based on anecdotal reports.",
      "Hazelgrove also makes an unconvincing argument that there were deaths that can be attributed to the panic over the broadcast. He even stretches to speculate that a car accident reported on the night of the broadcast could have been related without any evidence to back that up.",
      "There' no doubt that Welles' drama had a major impact on pop culture, and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d will have an enduring legacy. Hazelgrove's book misses an opportunity to fully revisit the reports of the panic it caused.",

      "The lawsuit brought by Chang Chun-Ko in White Plains federal court sought unspecified damages on behalf of Chang and other alleged victims of Shen Yun, which is based in Dragon Springs in Cuddebackville, New York, along with other entities named as defendants.",
      "It said the group has adopted some of the most abusive practices of the Chinese Communist Party, including subjecting children to public humiliation as discipline, even as it faces persecution by the CCP.",
      "The lawsuit said Shen Yun has made hundreds of millions of dollars by exploiting young dancers it recruits from abroad, forcing them to work grueling hours and scaring them into thinking they'd face harm if they quit.",
      "Shen Yun did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Its website said 85% of its performers were adults. It called touring with Shen Yun a \u201cchance of a lifetime\u201d for aspiring young artists, enabling them to receive $50,000 worth of scholarships to attend schools registered with the New York State Department of Education or accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.",
      "According to the website, Shen Yun, along with Fei Tian Academy of the Arts and Fei Tian College \u2014 which were also named as defendants \u2014 were founded by followers of the Falun Gong faith.",

      "The lawsuit said she contracted measles when she was 14 but was not permitted to see a doctor. Instead, the lawsuit said, she was told to meditate to feel better and was required to work while she recovered.",
      "Chang was terminated from Shen Yun in 2020 when she was 24 years old and was returned to Taiwan, where she was diagnosed with clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit."

    "story": [
      "After almost a year of testimony, closing statements began in the YSL gang and racketeering trial that included rapper Young Thug",
      "ATLANTA -- Prosecutors said Monday that the last two defendants in a long-running gang and racketeering trial committed murder on behalf of an Atlanta street gang co-founded by rapper Young Thug.",
      "But defense attorneys said the state slapped together cherry-picked social media posts and song lyrics with unreliable witness testimony to paint a misleading narrative about young men from tough upbringings who tried to escape poverty through music.",
      "It\u2019s now up to a jury to decide whether to convict Shannon Stillwell and Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, on gang, murder, drug and gun charges. The original indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.",
      "The trial for six of those defendants began a year ago. Four of them, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty last month. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after weeks of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",
      "The trial has been plagued by problems and delays. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker, who took over the case in July after the original judge was recused, often lost patience with prosecutors.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d in an Atlanta barbershop. Prosecutors say Thomas was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged with the 2022 murder of Shymel Drinks in retaliation for the murders of two YSL associates days earlier, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, co-founded a criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they said was associated with the national Bloods gang. Young Thug's record label is also known as YSL, for Young Stoner Life. Kendrick was featured on two popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d and another Young Thug song that prosecutors played during their closing.",
      "Doug Weinstein, Kendrick's defense attorney, said it was wrong for prosecutors to target the defendants \u2014 all Black \u2014 for their music and lyrics.",
      "Prosecutor Simone Hylton said the case was about \u201creal bodies,\u201d not a \u201csong over a beat.\u201d",
      "\"We are targeting gang members who decided to wreak havoc on communities in Fulton County,\" Hylton said. \u201cAnd those communities that they violated, those communities were communities of color.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Christian Adkins said YSL was a violent gang that operated through \u201cdeception, intimidation, destruction and death.\u201d",
      "He pointed to social media posts in which he said showed members admittedly killed people in rival gangs and said their clothes and tattoos were \u201cwalking billboards\u201d for YSL.",
      "Weinstein and Stillwell's defense attorney, Max Schardt, said prosecutors threw a bunch of separate alleged crimes, many from around a decade ago, into an indictment without showing that they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"The state has spent the past year with a hammer in their hand banging on a square peg that they call evidence,\" Schardt said.",
      "But \u201cthat square peg does not fit in that round hole,\u201d he said.",
      "Alleged YSL affiliates said during the trial they lied to police to avoid long prison sentences. Schardt theorized one of those witnesses killed Thomas. He framed Stillwell, Kendrick and others as a part of his string of lies to avoid the threat of prison, Schardt said.",
      "But Hylton said that witnesses and others lied on the stand when they were in front of the people \u201cthey snitched on,\u201d not to the police.",
      "Before he got \u201csucked up in this targeting of Jeffery Williams,\u201d Weinstein said Kendrick was focused on the rap career that helped him move on from his troubled past after plans to play football at the University of Georgia fell through.",
      "His client wasn\u2019t even in the car used in the drive-by shooting that killed Thomas, Weinstein said. But prosecutors said Kendrick was the one who alerted his counterparts about Thomas' whereabouts before he was murdered.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just as guilty as the ones who pulled the trigger,\u201d Hylton said.",
      "Schardt said surveillance footage showed Stillwell drove away from Drinks' car before he was shot, and there was no gunshot residue found in Stillwell's vehicle. Hylton said the footage proved Stillwell fled the scene at 90 miles per hour through a red light after shooting at least three rounds into Drinks' Nissan.",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Tuesday. If they do not reach a verdict Wednesday, they will return after Thanksgiving.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cTogether, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America\u2019s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O\u2019Neill, a former HHS official and Silicon Valley investor, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O\u2019Neill \u201cwill oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d the president-elect announced.",
      "O\u2019Neill is a longtime associate of billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Trump's leading backers from the tech industry. Thiel and O'Neill co-founded Mithril Capital Management, a venture fund that invests in medical technology and other startup companies. O\u2019Neill previously served in HHS under George W. Bush and was considered to head the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's first term. He has expressed disdain for federal regulation, including FDA's approach to regulating emerging drugs and other technologies.",
      "O\u2019Neill also worked on some of Thiel\u2019s signature projects, often reflecting his libertarian philosophy.",
      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- A doctor who was arrested in Berlin in August is now suspected of killing eight patients and in some cases trying to cover up the evidence by setting fires, investigators said Thursday.",
      "The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service's palliative care team, was suspected at the time of his arrest of killing four elderly patients in June and July and then attempting with mixed success to set fires at their apartments.",
      "Police and prosecutors said Thursday that additional cases surfaced when they examined patients' files and carried out forensic examinations of suspected victims, two of whom were exhumed.",
      "In the earliest case, he is a suspected of administering a lethal mixture of medicines to a 70-year-old man in January. In a similar case in early April, the alleged victim was a 61-year-old woman. A few weeks later, he is alleged to have killed an 83-year-old man in his room at a Berlin hospice with a mixture of medicines.",
      "In the fourth new case, in June, he is alleged to have killed a 70-year-old woman at her apartment and then set a fire. Firefighters were able to prevent the blaze spreading to the rest of the building.",
      "The 40-year-old doctor was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, arson and attempted arson. Prosecutors said they are now treating the cases as murder because the suspect appears to have had no motive other than killing the patients.",
      "The suspect's name hasn't been released, in keeping with German privacy rules. Prosecutors say he hasn't yet responded to the allegations."

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's attorney general will appeal a ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's laws restricting abortion.",
      "A county judge in October determined that last year\u2019s voter-approved amendment enshrining reproductive rights effectively made the so-called heartbeat law unconstitutional. The law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 had been paused pending the challenge.",
      "Republican Attorney General Dave Yost on Friday filed a notice of appeal with the court. His office said there are provisions in the law that aren't addressed in the constitutional amendment.",
      "\u201cIt is up to the courts to determine how conflicts between those two documents are resolved,\" said Bethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Yost.",
      "Yost acknowledged in earlier court filings that the amendment rendered the Ohio ban unconstitutional, but sought to maintain other elements of the 2019 law, including certain notification and reporting provisions.",
      "Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins said in his ruling that retaining those provisions would have subjected doctors who perform abortions to felony criminal charges, fines, license suspensions or revocations, and civil claims of wrongful death \u2014 and required patients to make two in-person visits to their provider, wait 24 hours for the procedure and have their abortion recorded and reported."

      "The man\u2019s attorneys celebrated Monday\u2019s verdict, saying they are hopeful it will prevent other men from falling victim to a scheme that involved fraud and what they described as dangerous penile injections. They said the punitive and compensatory damages total the largest amount to ever be awarded by a jury in a medical malpractice case in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt's a national record setting case and it's righteous because I don't think there's any place for licensed professionals to be defrauding patients for money. That is a very egregious breach of their fiduciary duty,\" said Lori Bencoe, one of the lawyers who represented the plaintiff. \"That's breach of trust and anytime someone is wearing a white coat, they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\u201d",
      "The award follows a trial held in Albuquerque earlier this month that centered on allegations outlined in a lawsuit filed by the man's attorneys in 2020. NuMale Medical Center and company officials were named as defendants.",
      "According to the complaint, the man was 66 when he visited the clinic in 2017 in search of treatment for fatigue and weight loss. The clinic is accused of misdiagnosing him and unnecessarily treating him with \u201cinvasive erectile dysfunction shots\u201d that caused irreversible damage.",
      "Nick Rowley, another attorney who was part of the plaintiff's team, said the out-of-state medical corporation set up a \u201cfraudulent scheme to make millions off of conning old men.\u201d He provided some details in a social media post, saying clinic workers told patients they would have irreversible damage if they didn't agree to injections three times a week.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has denied more than a million marketing applications for candy- or fruit-flavored products that appeal to kids, part of a wider crackdown that advocates say helped drive down teen vaping after an \u201cepidemic level\u201d surge in 2019.",

      "Donald Trump's health team picks includes outspoken critics of the medical establishment and COVID-19 health measures",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has assembled a team of medical contrarians and health care critics to fulfill an agenda aimed at remaking how the federal government oversees medicines, health programs and nutrition.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump nominated Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health, tapping an opponent of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates to lead the nation's top medical research agency. He is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who were critics of COVID-19 health measures.",
      "Bhattacharya and the other nominees are expected to play pivotal roles in implementing Robert F. Kennedy Jr's sprawling \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives from U.S. foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs. Trump nominated Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH and other federal health agencies.",
      "The new health priorities bear little resemblance to those of Trump\u2019s first term, which focused on cutting regulations for food, drug and agriculture companies.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re hearing a very different tune as we head into this new Trump administration,\u201d said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University\u2019s school of public health. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we all proceed with caution and remember some of the public health losses we saw the first time.\u201d",
      "Trump's nominees don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, had been frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years.",
      "Here's a look at how the nominees may carry out Kennedy's plans to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials:",
      "The National Institutes of Health, with a $48 billion budget, funds medical research through grants to scientists across the nation and conducts its own research.",
      "Bhattacharya, a health economist and physician at Stanford University, was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Kennedy has said he would pause NIH's drug development and infectious disease research and shift its focus to chronic diseases. He also would like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest. In 2017, he said the agency wasn't doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism \u2014 an idea that has long been debunked.",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated flu vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.",
      "Weldon's congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths.",
      "Kennedy has been extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.",
      "Makary, Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is a professor at Johns Hopkins University, a trained surgeon and a cancer specialist. He is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics.",
      "Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "Kennedy has suggested he'll clear out \u201centire\u201d FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Makary's contrarian views during COVID-19 included questioning the need for COVID-19 vaccine boosters in young kids.",
      "The agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed \u2014 and an agency that Kennedy hasn't talked about much.",
      "While Trump tried to scrap the Affordable Care Act in his first term, Kennedy has not taken aim at it yet.",
      "The Biden administration on Tuesday revealed a new plan to force Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for many Americans who are obese. Kennedy has opposed the idea, saying government-sponsored insurance programs should instead expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "Trump said during his campaign that he would protect Medicare, which provides insurance for older Americans. Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage \u2014 a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud.",
      "Kennedy doesn't appear to have said much publicly about what he'd like to see from the surgeon general.",
      "The nation's top doctor has little administrative power but can influence what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it \u2014 suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories. The current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence as a public health crisis in June.",
      "Trump's pick, Nesheiwat, is employed as a New York City medical director with CityMD, a group of urgent care facilities.

      "Lebanese families with children diagnosed with cancer are now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war",
      "BEIRUT -- Carol Zeghayer gripped her IV as she hurried down the brightly lit hallway of Beirut\u2019s children\u2019s cancer center. The 9-year-old's face brightened when she spotted her playmates from the oncology ward.",
      "Diagnosed with cancer just months before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel erupted in October 2023, Carol relies on weekly trips to the center in the Lebanese capital for treatment.",
      "But what used to be a 90-minute drive, now takes up to three hours on a mountainous road to skirt the heavy bombardment in south Lebanon, but still not without danger from Israeli airstrikes. The family is just one among many across Lebanon now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just a child. When they strike, she asks me, \u2018Mama, was that far?\u2019\u201d said her mother, Sindus Hamra.",
      "The family lives in Hasbaya, a province in southeastern Lebanon where the rumble of Israeli airstrikes has become part of daily life. Just 15 minutes away from their home, in the front-line town of Khiam, Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters clash amidst relentless bombardments.",
      "On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross.",
      "The bombardment hasn\u2019t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed.",
      "More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cHer situation is very tricky \u2014 her cancer can spread to her head,\u201d Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead.",
      "While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 among them were families with children battling cancer.",
      "The Children\u2019s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient\u2019s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center\u2019s fundraising and events executive.",
      "During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.",
      "\u201cThey had no place to go,\u201d she added. \"We\u2019ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.\u201d",
      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",

      "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022.",
      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

We need to keep the expertise up. We need to keep the diplomacy up.\u201d",

      "The CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. The staff is heavy with scientists \u2014 60% have master\u2019s degrees or doctorates.",
      "The last eight years have been perhaps the most difficult in the agency's history. The CDC once enjoyed a sterling international reputation for its expertise on infectious diseases and other causes of illness and death. But trust in the agency fell because of missteps during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, political attacks and resistance to infection-prevention measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated.",

In California, more than 435 dairy herds have seen infections \u2014 more than all other U.S. states combined. And high levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows.",
      "About 20% of samples of pasteurized milk sold in stores were found to contain viral remnants of the virus, according to tests conducted earlier this year by government scientists. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the bird flu virus and also bacteria such as E. coli, listeria and salmonella, which are known to make people sick.",
      "Officials with California's Department of Food and Agriculture have been conducting weekly tests of raw milk in bulk tanks from the state's dairies. Additional tests conducted at Raw Farm sites in California were negative for the virus, but officials said they would begin testing for bird flu twice a week.",
      "Few tests of unpasteurized milk products from stores have been conducted, so it's possible that other raw dairy products may contain the virus, Osterholm said.",
      "\u201cIt is still really unclear how much testing is going on,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe're flying blind.\u201d",
      "To date, there's no evidence that people have been infected with the bird flu virus by drinking raw milk. At least 55 people in the U.S. are known to have been infected by the virus this year, but nearly all were dairy or poultry workers who developed mild illness after close contact with infected animals.",
      "Tests have shown that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu became very sick and barn cats on farms that drank milk from infected cows suffered brain damage and died, noted Nicole Martin, a microbiologist and associate director of the Milk Quality Improvement Program at Cornell University,",
      "\u201cI don't think we know yet whether people can contract H5N1 from consumption of raw milk, but we have enough evidence that would suggest that folks need to be a little more cautious right now,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Nearly 4.4% of U.S. adults, or about 11 million people, report that they drink raw milk at least once each year. About 1% of adults say they consume raw milk each week, according to a 2022 FDA study.",
      "Proponents of raw milk cite perceived health benefits and better taste as key reasons for consumption. Raw Farm advertises its products as \u201cunprocessed and complete\u201d with vitamins, minerals, enzymes and beneficial bacteria.",
      "Fans include Kennedy, who has said he only drinks raw milk. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under Trump.",
      "Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm, has appeared several times on podcasts hosted by Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's former running mate. Both Kennedy and Shanahan are customers, McAfee told the Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThey want that same level of differentiating, wonderful, tested, gorgeous, safe, delicious raw milk for everybody,\" McAfee said.",
      "Health officials have warned for years that raw milk can cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening. Between 1998 and 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented more than 200 illness outbreaks traced to raw milk, which sickened more than 2,600 people and hospitalized more than 225.",
      "Before the U.S. adopted safety standards in 1924 under what was called the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, about 25% of foodborne illnesses were related to dairy consumption, according to the Center for Dairy Research. Now, dairy products account for about 1% of such illnesses.",

      "Nebraska has moved closer to allowing medical marijuana",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Three weeks after Nebraska voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana the state moved a step closer to allowing it Tuesday when a judge ruled that the petitions that put the question on the ballot were valid.",
      "The decision by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong was a victory for advocates of medical marijuana, but opponents are likely to appeal it to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTo prevail in this action, the plaintiff and Secretary had to show that more than 3,463 signatures on the Legalization Petition and 3,357 signatures on the Regulatory Petition are invalid. The Plaintiff and Secretary are well short,\u201d Strong wrote. Fewer than 1,000 signatures on each petition were shown to be invalid.",
      "A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general said the office\u2019s lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering whether to file an appeal.",
      "Medical marijuana supporters didn't immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday after the ruling was released.",
      "More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalization at the polls Nov. 5. The results are scheduled to be certified Dec. 2.",
      "Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers argued that problems with the way thousands of signatures were gathered meant the ballot initiatives shouldn\u2019t have been put to voters. One person who circulated petitions in Grand Island was criminally charged with falsifying at least 164 signatures. Evnen, Hilgers and former state Sen. John Kuehn also raised questions about whether other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana argued in court that even if some of the signatures gathered were flawed, the group still had well over the 86,499 needed. The Secretary of State's office certified nearly 90,000 signatures on both the petition to allow marijuana for medical use and the one to set up a commission to regulate it.",
      "The judge agreed that the state wasn't able to show any widespread fraud. Instead the ruling pointed primarily to the one petition circulator who was charged and raised questions about whether some other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Strong said she reviewed thousands of messages that top two organizers of the petition campaign exchanged that filled more than 800 pages and only found one mention of notarizing petitions outside of the petition circulator's presence.",
      "This year marked the third time Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana tried to get the issue on the ballot and the first time it made it there.",
      "In 2020, the group came close after meeting signature requirements. But opponents sued, arguing that advocates violated state rules requiring ballot measures to focus on a single question. Instead, the measure posed two separate questions: whether residents should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes, and whether private companies should be allowed to grow and sell it.",
      "The state Supreme Court prevented the questions from going to voters.",
      "In 2022, organizers failed to collect enough signatures in time to get the question on the November ballot.",
      "Voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida all rejected measures to legalize recreational marijuana use this year. But dozens of states have previously legalized it for either medical or recreational use, most recently in Ohio last year. In May, the federal government also began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug."

    "summary": "There&rsquo;s no place like home for the holidays",
    "story": [
      "There\u2019s no place like home for the holidays",
      "NEW YORK -- There's no place like home for the holidays. And that may not necessarily be a good thing.",
      "In the wake of the very contentious and divisive 2024 presidential election, the upcoming celebration of Thanksgiving and the ramp-up of the winter holiday season could be a boon for some \u2014 a respite from the events of the larger world in the gathering of family and loved ones. Hours and even days spent with people who have played the largest roles in our lives. Another chapter in a lifetime of memories.",
      "That's one scenario.",
      "For others, that same period \u2014 particularly because of the polarizing presidential campaign \u2014 is something to dread. There is the likelihood of disagreements, harsh words, hurt feelings and raised voices looming large.",
      "Those who make a study of people and their relationships to each other in an increasingly complex 21st-century say there are choices that those with potentially fraught personal situations can make \u2014 things to do and things to avoid \u2014 that could help them and their families get through this time with a minimum of open conflict and a chance at getting to the point of the holidays in the first place.",
      "For those who feel strongly about the election's outcome, and know that the people they would be spending the holiday feel just as strongly in the other direction, take the time to honestly assess if you're ready to spend time together in THIS moment, barely a few weeks after Election Day \u2014 and a time when feelings are still running high.",
      "The answer might be that you're not, and it might be better to take a temporary break, says Justin Jones-Fosu, author of \u201cI Respectfully Disagree: How to Have Difficult Conversations in a Divided World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to assess your own readiness,\u201d he says, \u201cEach person is going be very different in this.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that it's not about taking a permanent step back. \u201cRight now is that moment that we\u2019re talking about because it\u2019s still so fresh. Christmas may be different.\u201d",
      "Keep focused on why why you decided to go in the first place, Jones-Fosu says. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s a relative there you don\u2019t get to see often, or a loved one is getting up in age, or your kids want to see their cousins. Keeping that reason in mind could help you get through the time.",
      "If you decide getting together is the way to go, but you know politics is still a dicey subject, set a goal of making the holiday a politics-free zone and stick with it, says Karl Pillemer, a professor at Cornell University whose work includes research on family estrangement.",
      "\u201cWill a political conversation change anyone\u2019s mind?\" he says. \u201cIf there is no possibility of changing anyone\u2019s mind, then create a demilitarized zone and don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
      "Let\u2019s be honest. Sometimes, despite best efforts and intentions to keep the holiday gathering politics- and drama-free, there\u2019s someone who\u2019s got something to say and is going to say it.",
      "In that case, avoid getting drawn into it, says Tracy Hutchinson, a professor in the graduate clinical mental health counseling program at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "\u201cNot to take the hook is one of the most important things, and it is challenging,\u201d she says. After all, you don\u2019t have to go to every argument you\u2019re invited to.",
      "If you risk getting caught up in the moment, consider engaging in what Pillemer calls \u201cforward mapping.\u201d This involves thinking medium and long term rather than just about right now \u2014 strategy rather than tactics. Maybe imagine yourself six months from now looking back on the dinner and thinking about the memories you'd want to have.",
      "\u201cThink about how you would like to remember this holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to remember it with your brother and sister-in-law storming out and going home because you\u2019ve had a two-hour argument?\u201d",
      "Things getting intense? Defuse the situation. Walk away. And it doesn't have to be in a huff. Sometimes a calm and collected time out is just what you \u2014 and the family \u2014 might need.",
      "Says Hutchinson: \u201cIf they do start to do something like that, you could say, `I\u2019ve got to make this phone call. I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m going to take a walk around the block.'\""

      "Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $35 billion proposal from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $ 35 billion proposal  from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The rule, unveiled Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department, would require Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound for a large segment of Americans who are obese.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal, which would not go into effect until after Trump takes office, will have support from his new administration \u2014 including from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an opponent of the drugs whom the president-elect has tapped to serve as head of HHS.",
      "Here's what to know about the drugs and the Biden administration's proposal:",
      "The weight-loss drugs, also called anti-obesity medications or GLP-1s, mimic the hormone known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The drugs include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro.",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But a slice of \u201cnonresponders\u201d did not lose significant body weight.",
      "Private health insurers have limited coverage of the drugs. Medicare has been barred from covering them under a law that says the program cannot pay for weight-loss products. Coverage through Medicaid, meanwhile, has varied from state to state.",
      "That's meant the drugs \u2014 which can cost upwards of $1,000 monthly \u2014 have been largely unaffordable for many.",
      "The rule announced Tuesday affects Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for roughly 70 million of the nation\u2019s poorest people, and Medicare, the health insurance program for about 67 million older Americans.",
      "Under the proposal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, would reinterpret the federal law, to consider the drugs as a treatment for obesity diseases.",
      "The nation's top health agency estimates as many as 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "And the proposal would cost a lot of money \u2014 at least $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "The drugs are popular \u2014 with a majority of Americans telling health firm KFF in a poll earlier this year that Medicare should cover the drugs. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, too, has lobbied for coverage of the drugs.",
      "But support is mixed in Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Kennedy has railed against the idea of Medicare or Medicaid covering the drugs. Instead, he's told Congress that they should expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships through the government-sponsored health care programs.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is poised to take the helm of CMS, has said the drugs can be a helpful tool. In a video posted to Instagram last year, Oz praised some of the benefits of the drugs, but said the long-term effects should be further studied.",
      "\u201cI think these new generation of medications offer us a huge opportunity,\u201d Oz said.",
      "Trump or Kennedy could ultimately ignore Biden's proposal and not implement it.",
      "Some lawmakers praised the move on Tuesday, while others expressed skepticism.",
      "Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican who sponsored a bill to have Medicare cover the weight-loss drugs, has argued that covering the drugs and other obesity treatments could save taxpayers in the long run.",
      "\u201cI am encouraged to see the Administration support our efforts to help make Americans healthier by allowing Medicare coverage of new, physician prescribed and FDA approved anti-obesity medications,\" Wenstrup said in a statement.",
      "He called for the Congress to pass a law that would help pay for dietitians, nutritionists and behavioral therapy to treat obesity.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, warned that unless the government required drugmakers to lower the price of the medications Medicare premiums would \u201cskyrocket\" under the plan.",
      "It's good for more Americans to have access to these drugs, which have proven effective, but Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition and obesity expert at Harvard University, hopes that it doesn't become the primary way obesity is treated in America.",
      "He worries that not enough investment is being made to figure out what is driving climbing obesity rates across the U.S., and the role that healthy foods and exercise might play in solving that epidemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to treat the problems that we now face with drugs, but let\u2019s not stop there,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cLet\u2019s identify what\u2019s causing the problem, and ultimately rely on these drugs \u2014 which have side effects \u2014 less and less over time.\u201d",
      "Dr. Andrew Kraftson, who treats obese patients at the University of Michigan, is happy that more of his patients might be able to afford these drugs, which he has prescribed for patients and has had successful results. But he, too, would like to see more research and guidance from the government on prescribing the medications.",
      "Kraftson also worries about some of the side effects for elderly patients. The drugs, he points out, can lead to muscle loss, which is a bigger problem for older Americans who are at risk of falling, for example.",
      "\u201cI'm advocating for their thoughtful use,\u201d Kraftson said. \"Because if you have a senior and you just write a prescription and the visit takes five minutes, is that an appropriate level of care? Have we defined that well?",

      "Kentucky\u2019s attorney general has expanded an opioid-related lawsuit to target another pharmacy benefit manager",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky's attorney general has expanded an opioid-related lawsuit to target another big pharmacy benefit manager that he claims contributed to the state's deadly addiction crisis.",
      "OptumRx has been added as a new defendant in the suit that was filed two months ago, Attorney General Russell Coleman said Tuesday. His claims against Optum and its affiliated organizations are similar to those initially made against Express Scripts, which remains a defendant in the case.",
      "The Republican attorney general accused Optum of playing a central role in what he called the reckless promotion, dispensing and oversupply of opioids. OptumRx controls a pharmacy network consisting of about 67,000 retail pharmacy locations nationwide, the suit said.",
      "Kentucky was ravaged by the addiction crisis, resulting in some of the nation\u2019s highest overdose death rates.",
      "\u201cThese groups pushed a profit-fueled agenda at the expense of Kentucky families, who are left with empty seats at the dinner table,\u201d Coleman said in a release.",
      "Optum did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. When it was sued in September, Express Scripts responded that it has long worked to combat opioid overuse and abuse and would \u201cvigorously contest these baseless allegations in court.\u201d",
      "Coleman initially filed the legal action in a state court, but the two sides are wrangling over whether it should be in state or federal court, his office said. He wants the case heard in state court.",
      "Coleman has accused the defendants of using deceptive marketing to boost sales of highly addictive drugs. They also dispensed opioids through mail-order pharmacies without effective controls in violation of Kentucky and federal law, he said.",
      "He is seeking, among other things, civil penalties for each willful violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, plus any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.",
      "\u201cDefendants have hidden their conduct through non-transparent business practices and by requiring each entity with whom they conduct business, such as opioid manufacturers, to enter into confidentiality agreements or otherwise keep their agreements confidential,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, run prescription drug coverage for health insurers and employers that provide coverage. They help decide which drugs make a plan\u2019s formulary, or list of covered medications. They also can determine where patients go to fill their prescriptions.",
      "PBMs have drawn the ire of politicians, patients and others for years. PBMs say they play an important role in controlling drug costs and pass along most of the discounts they negotiate to their clients.",
      "Government lawsuits against pharmacy benefit managers are the latest frontier \u2013 and maybe the last big one \u2013 in years of litigation over the opioid-related drug epidemic in the U.S.",
      "Drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacy chains have already faced stacks of lawsuits and settled many of them, with most of the money required to be used to fight the overdose and addiction crisis.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. A decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight annual decline, but state leaders say fatalities remain tragically high and the fight against the drug epidemic is far from over. Nearly 2,000 Kentuckians died last year from drug overdoses."

      "Food safety experts say safely serving a holiday feast takes planning and know-how",
      "Ready or not, the holidays are here. It's a time when many Americans accustomed to preparing simple meals find themselves responsible for safely serving multi-dish feasts.",
      "It's no easy task. Outbreaks of some types of food poisoning tend to rise in November and December, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tainted turkey, undercooked stuffing and germ-laced gravy from holiday buffets have all led to past illnesses \u2014 and even deaths \u2014 CDC investigators have found.",
      "It can be tricky for occasional cooks to prepare big meals in a way that avoids the common hazards that can make people sick, said Donald Schaffner, a food science expert at Rutgers University.",
      "\u201cCooking takes longer with big masses of food. Cooling takes longer with big masses of food,\u201d said Schaffner, who co-hosts the food-safety podcast \u201cRisky or Not?\u201d",
      "Together with podcast co-host Benjamin Chapman, a food scientist at North Carolina State University, Schaffner outlined common ways to keep holiday meals both festive and safe.",
      "Nearly 90% of U.S. hosts plan to serve turkey on Thanksgiving this year, according to the turkey producer Butterball.",
      "But raw turkey can harbor illness-causing bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and other germs. It must be handled safely to prevent those bugs from contaminating refrigerator surfaces, sinks and kitchen counters.",
      "A frozen bird must be thawed first. There are several accepted methods, including in the refrigerator, in the microwave or in cold running water, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cAll of these methods pose risks,\u201d he cautioned.",
      "A frozen turkey needs about 24 hours for every 4 to 5 pounds of weight to thaw in a refrigerator, according to the Agriculture Department. If you use a microwave or the cold water method, the bird must be cooked immediately. For details about safe turkey handling, check out the thawing and cooking calculators created by the USDA.",
      "And don\u2019t wash the turkey. It\u2019s a bad idea to rinse it in the sink, even though many cooks still insist on the practice, often out of habit, said Chapman.",
      "\u201cAnything that hits that surface and generates spray is going to basically spread contamination around your kitchen,\u201d he said.",
      "Instead, pat the turkey dry with paper towels and toss them, or use a kitchen towel and disinfect it in the laundry.",
      "Turkey needs to reach a cooked temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before serving. The best way to tell if it\u2019s cooked is to use a tip-sensitive digital thermometer inserted in the innermost section of the thigh, not touching the bone.",
      "Don\u2019t rely on the plastic pop-up thermometers stuck in some commercial turkeys. Chapman\u2019s past research shows that those buttons can activate well before the bird is actually done.",
      "At the same time, don\u2019t determine doneness by relying on signs such as golden-brown skin, whether the meat is no longer pink or whether the juices run clear.",
      "\u201cNone of those are great indicators of temperature,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "How you handle the rest of the meal \u2014 mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans or yams \u2014 is just as important as the main dish. It\u2019s crucial to avoid the so-called danger zone of temperatures between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where bacteria can easily grow.",
      "The key is to keep hot foods piping hot and cold foods cold \u2014 and to refrigerate everything promptly, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cThe recommendation is that you get those leftovers into the refrigerator within two hours of when they came off of the stove,\u201d he said.",
      "Make sure to refrigerate dense foods like sliced turkey, cooked sweet potatoes or gravy in shallow containers to help them cool down fast. Schaffner\u2019s recent research showed that foods cooled in containers at a depth of no more than 2 inches posed little risk of growing dangerous germs.",
      "One key way to avoid food poisoning is through scrupulous cleaning in the kitchen.",
      "Wash your hands before preparing food and after touching raw poultry. Use separate cutting boards, knives and other utensils when handling raw meat and fresh foods such as vegetables and salads.",
      "Pay close attention to any surface that may be contaminated. It\u2019s important to clean first with soap and water and then sanitize with a disinfectant \u2014 a two-step process.",

      "Authorities in Mali have arrested four senior employees of a Canadian mining company as the military regime in the West African nation continues to detain workers to pressure companies in its crucial mining sector to pay millions in additional taxes",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Authorities in Mali have arrested four senior employees of a Canadian mining company as the military regime in the West African nation continues to detain workers to pressure companies in its crucial mining sector to pay millions in additional taxes.",
      "Barrick Gold in a statement Tuesday confirmed that four employees at its Loulo-Gounkoto mining complex had been charged and awaited trial after their arrests Monday evening.",
      "The company said it rejects the charges but did not say what they were. Malian authorities refused to comment on the arrests.",
      "The same Barrick Gold employees also were briefly taken into custody in September. Barrick Gold says it has been seeking to finalize an agreement that would guide its partnership with Mali's government, including the state\u2019s share of the economic benefits generated by the mining site and the \u201clegal framework under which this would be managed.\u201d",
      "In Tuesday's statement, Barrick Gold CEO Mark Bristow said that \u201cattempts to find a mutually acceptable resolution have so far been unsuccessful, but we remain committed to engage with the government in order to resolve all the claims levied against the company and its employees and secure the early release of our unjustly imprisoned colleagues.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the CEO of Australian company Resolute Mining and two employees were arrested in Mali's capital, Bamako. They were released after the company paid $80 million to Malian authorities to resolve a tax dispute and promised to pay a further $80 million in the coming months.",
      "Mali is one of Africa\u2019s leading gold producers, but it has struggled for years with jihadi violence and high levels of poverty and hunger. The military seized power in 2020, and the regime has placed foreign mining companies under growing pressure as it seeks to shore up government revenues.",
      "\u201cMali is likely to continue to using detentions, arrests and even charges against mining executives to compel foreign-owned companies to comply with new regulations and generate short-term funds,\" Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at the Control Risks Group consulting firm, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"These regulations are currently being applied retroactively, which is likely to increase regulatory disputes and make the mining sector challenging and unpredictable for Western companies,\u201d Ochieng added.",
      "Last year, Mali's military authorities carried out an audit of the mining sector before drawing up a new mining code this year. In August, authorities set up a commission to negotiate with mining companies over what the government says they owe according to the audit.",
      "Ochieng said the government\u2019s audit has not been transparent and the new mining code gives Mali's authorities a greater share.",
      "Earlier this year, Canadian mining companies B2Gold and Allied Gold accepted the demands, making payments to authorities and agreeing to the new mining code."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s president on Wednesday met a visiting Ukraine delegation and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s recent dispatch of more than 10,000 soldiers to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "The North Korean troop deployment is threatening to expand the almost three-year war, with Ukraine and the U.S. saying that some of the soldiers have already begun engaging in battle on the front lines. Seoul and Washington also worry that Russia might in return help North Korea build more advanced nuclear weapons targeting them. In late October, South Korea warned it could respond by supplying weapons to Ukraine.",
      "During a meeting with the Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, President Yoon Suk Yeol said he hopes that Seoul and Kiev will work out effective ways to cope with the security threat posed by the North Korean-Russian military cooperation including the North\u2019s troop dispatch, Yoon\u2019s office said in a statement.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation later met separately with Yoon\u2019s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, and Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun. During the meetings, Umerov briefed the South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul will strengthen cooperation, the statement said.",
      "It said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on the North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers while closely coordinating with the United States.",
      "The South Korean statement didn\u2019t say whether the two sides discussed Seoul\u2019s possible weapons supply to Ukraine.",
      "Many observers say Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election could make South Korea more cautious about potentially shipping weapons to Ukraine because Trump has promised to end the war swiftly.",
      "Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and shipped humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms in line with its policy of not supplying lethal weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will take phased countermeasures, linking the level of their response to the degree of Russia-North Korean cooperation. Shin, the national security adviser, said last week that Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for its sending troops  to Russia. Experts say it\u2019s unlikely that Russia will transfer high-tech nuclear and missile technology to North Korea in the initial stage of the troop dispatch.",
      "North Korea and Russia have sharply increased their military and other cooperation as each face confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. The U.S., South Korea and others accuse North Korea of having shipped artillery, missiles and other conventional weapons to Russia."

      "Two of London\u2019s most famous markets \u2014 one selling fish, the other meat \u2014 are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times",
      "LONDON -- Two of London's most famous markets \u2014 one selling fish, the other meat \u2014 are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times.",
      "On Wednesday, the City of London Corporation, the governing body in the capital city's historic hub, is set to present a bill to Parliament to bring an end to its responsibilities to operate the Billingsgate fish market and the Smithfield meat market, both of which have existed in some shape or form since the 11th century.",
      "That comes a day after the corporation decided not to relocate the markets to a new development just east of London in Dagenham.",
      "It abandoned the planned move because of the growing expense, both as a result of the recent bout of inflation and an increase in construction costs \u2014 at around 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion), as things stand.",
      "Instead, under a new agreement with market traders, the corporation will provide financial compensation and advice. The traders have a bit of time to work out what to do, with operations continuing until at least 2028.",
      "\u201cThis decision represents a positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate Markets in that it empowers Traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals,\" said Chris Hayward, the policy chairman of the City of London Corporation. \u201cBy stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently.\u201d",
      "The traders will now work out how to relocate to wherever they wish to in London, potentially on their own or within groups.",
      "No doubt, wherever they end up, their place of work will be shiny and new. But it will be lacking in tradition.",
      "At Smithfield, the market traders typically begin work at 10 p.m., selling mainly to the restaurant trade, and finish up at about 6 a.m., just as the rest of the city is waking up. Pubs around the market traditionally had special licenses allowing them to open in the early hours of the morning to serve the traders.",
      "Peter Ackroyd, who wrote the seminal \u201cLondon: The Biography\u201d in 2000, said the Billingsgate fish market has its roots in the early 11th century, before William the Conqueror turned up with his Norman troops in England to bring an end to Saxon times. Smithfield, built just beyond the old Roman wall, became the go-to place for the sale of horses, sheep and cattle later that century.",
      "Ackroyd describes how, for hundreds of years, Smithfield and Billingsgate, as well as other markets selling flowers, fruit and vegetables, and poultry, were woven into the fabric of London life, though often known for drunkenness, general rowdiness and violence. The great British author Charles Dickens described Smithfield, for example, as a center of \u201cfilth and mire,\u201d referencing the market in both \u201dOliver Twist\" and \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d",
      "With the advent of food standards and regular rebuilds, the markets are clearly not as squalid as they were in medieval times.",
      "But another costly rebuilding was looming. Smithfield's buildings date from Victorian times, with some modifications, and suffered a major fire in 1958, while Billingsgate has been at its current site in London Docklands since 1982, a district that was then derelict but is now home to the gleaming towers of the Canary Wharf financial district.",
      "There are proposals to build 4,000 much-needed new houses at the Billingsgate site, while Smithfield is set to become a cultural center and will house the new London Museum.",

      "Ukrainian officials say Russia has conducted a \u201cmassive\u201d attack against Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, firing nearly 200 missiles and drones and leaving more than a million households without power",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia conducted a \u201cmassive\u201d attack against Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure on Thursday, firing nearly 200 missiles and drones and leaving more than a million households without power, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Russia's second major aerial attack on Ukraine's power grid in less than two weeks amplified fears that the Kremlin aims to cripple the country's power generation capacity before winter.",
      "\u201cAttacks on energy facilities are happening all over Ukraine,\u201d Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said in a post on Facebook. He added that emergency power outages were implemented nationwide.",
      "Russia in previous years has targeted Ukraine\u2019s electricity generation, aiming to deny civilians critical heating and drinking water supplies during the bitter winter months and break Ukrainian spirits. The attacks also seek to hobble Ukraine\u2019s defense industry that is now producing missiles, drones and armored vehicles, among other military assets.",
      "In some regions on Thursday, Kalibr cruise missiles with cluster munitions smashed into civilian targets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, calling it \u201can insidious escalation.\u201d Cluster munitions release numerous small bombs over a wide area, making them dangerous to civilians both during and after an attack.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his forces struck 17 Ukrainian targets Thursday, including military facilities and their \u201csupport systems,\u201d with 100 drones and 90 missiles.",
      "It was the 11th massive combined attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year.",
      "But the Ukrainian air force claimed to have shot down 76 cruise missiles and three other types of missile as well as 32 drones. It added that it lost track of 62 Russian drones, which most likely were jammed by electronic warfare.",
      "Neither side's claims could be independently verified.",
      "Ukrainian officials have warned recently that Russia was stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles, presumably for another pre-winter aerial campaign against Ukraine\u2019s power grid. Ukrainian officials have in the past accused Russia of \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d Such massive attacks have been a regular feature of the war.",
      "Around half of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the almost three years of war with Russia, and rolling electricity blackouts are common. Kyiv's Western allies have sought to help Ukraine protect power generation with air defense systems and funds for rebuilding.",
      "Last March, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for two high-ranking Russian military officers on war crimes charges linked to attacks on Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure, including power plants and electricity sub-stations.",
      "The war has been going in Russia's favor in recent months as its bigger army uses its advantages in manpower and equipment to push Ukrainian forces backward in eastern areas, though its offensive has been slow and costly.",
      "Putin said that over the past two days Russia had fired 100 missiles and 466 drones at Ukraine, saying they were a response to Ukraine using American-made missiles to hit targets on Russian soil after gaining permission to do so from President Joe Biden.",
      "Speaking at a summit in Kazakhstan of a security alliance of former Soviet nations, Putin threatened to use a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called Oreshnik, against \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.",
      "The missile launched for the first time at Ukraine last week has six warheads and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, according to Putin, who declared that it can't be intercepted by any modern air defense systems.",
      "Oreshnik can penetrate underground bunkers and releases dozens of submunitions that \u201cturn everything to dust,\u201d Putin said. The use of several Oreshnik missiles in one strike would be comparable in its devastating power to a nuclear weapon, he claimed.",
      "Explosions in Thursday's Russian attack were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lutsk, and many other cities in central and western Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy urged Western countries to accelerate delivery of promised air defense weaponry. Ukrainian officials in the past have grumbled that military aid is slow to arrive.",
      "\u201cEach such attack proves that air defense systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not at storage bases,\u201d Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app.",
      "Russia uses large numbers of missiles and drones to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and exploits weather conditions such as dense fog and cloud cover to make interceptions harder, the Ukrainian air force said.",
      "The head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season. \u201cThey were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Western governments and South Korea say North Korea in recent months has intensified its military support for Russia.",
      "The head of the Lviv region in western Ukraine, Maksym Kozytskyi, said the attack left more than half a million households without electricity.",
      "Over 280,000 households in the northwestern Rivne region were without electricity because of the attack, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Koval. Running water supplies were also patchy in affected areas. Some schools in Rivne city switched to online classes.",
      "There were also strikes on the bordering Volyn region, where 215,000 households had no electricity, regional head Ivan Rudnytskyi said. All critical infrastructure that lost power was switched to generators.",
      "Energy infrastructure was also targeted in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region, local officials said. Air defenses were activated there, and emergency power outages were introduced.",
      "Local officials ordered the opening of \u201cpoints of invincibility\u201d \u2014 shelter-type places where people can charge their phones and other electrical devices and get refreshments during blackouts.",
      "In Kyiv, where the air raid alert lasted over nine hours, missile debris fell in one neighborhood, local officials said. No casualties were reported.",

      "A former British soldier who claimed he was trying to work as a double agent has been convicted of spying for Iran",
      "LONDON -- A former British soldier whose audacious escape from a London prison spurred a dayslong search was convicted on Thursday of spying for Iran.",
      "Daniel Khalife, 23, was found guilty by a jury in Woolwich Crown Court on violations of Britain's Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act by collecting information useful to an enemy \u2014 Iran. He was cleared of a charge of planting fake bombs in his military barracks.",
      "Prosecutors said Khalife played a \u201ccynical game\u201d by claiming he wanted to be a spy after he had delivered a large amount of restricted and classified material to the Iranian intelligence service, including the names of special forces officers.",
      "Khalife testified that he had been in touch with people in the Iranian government but that it was all part of a ploy to ultimately work as a double agent for Britain, a scheme he developed from watching the TV show \u201cHomeland.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to utilize my background to further our national security,\u201d he told jurors.",
      "Defense lawyer Gul Nawaz Hussein said Khalife\u2019s aspirations to be a James Bond figure were na\u00efve, stupid and bordered on slapstick. He said his client was more \u201cScooby Doo\u201d than \u201c007.\u201d",
      "Despite what seemed like amateurish bumbling, Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, said Khalife presented a danger.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate Walter Mitty character who was having a significant impact in the real world,\u201d Murphy said, referring to the fictional character in a James Thurber short story about a meek proofreader who daydreams of daring escapades.",
      "\u201cWe know very well the threat that Iranians pose to the U.K.'s national security\u201d Murphy said, noting that 20 plots, including assassination plans, had been disrupted by U.K. authorities.",
      "Khalife\u2019s court case had not received much attention until he escaped from a London prison in September 2023 and went on the run for three days.",
      "Khalife was working in the kitchen in Wandsworth Prison, in south London, when he strapped himself to the bottom of a delivery truck and got a lift to freedom. He was ultimately nabbed on a canal path after a massive search.",
      "The escape from the Victorian-era prison exposed much broader weaknesses with the nation\u2019s aging and overcrowded correctional system. An inquiry is currently underway into how Khalife was able to escape and whether others helped.",
      "During his trial, Khalife pleaded guilty to the escape, but continued to contest the spying charges.",
      "Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said Khalife faces \u201ca long custodial sentence\u201d when he is sentenced after the New Year.",
      "Khalife joined the Army at 16 and was assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit that is deployed with battlefield troops, as well as special forces and intelligence squads.",
      "He was told he could not join the intelligence service because his mother is from Iran.",
      "At 17, he reached out to a man connected with Iranian intelligence and began passing along information, prosecutors said. He was given NATO secret security clearance when he took part in a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021.",
      "British security officials were not aware of Khalife\u2019s contacts with the Iranians until he contacted MI6, the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence service, to offer to work as a double agent.",
      "He reached out to MI6 anonymously, saying he had earned the trust of his Iranian handlers and that they had rewarded him by leaving $2,000 cash ($1,578 pounds) in a dog poo bag in a north London park.",
      "Khalife said most of the material he provided to his Iranian handlers was information he made up or data available online and didn\u2019t expose military secrets.",
      "But prosecutors said some of the army documents were genuine and they used evidence from Khalife's mobile phones, notes he wrote to himself and surveillance footage to show he gathered and shared classified information. They also found he traveled to Turkey to meet a contact.",
      "\u201cHe surreptitiously sought out and obtained copies of secret and sensitive information which he knew were protected and passed these on to individuals he believed to be acting on behalf of the Iranian state,\u201d said Bethan David of the Crown Prosecution Service. \u201cThe sharing of the information could have exposed military personnel to serious harm, or a risk to life, and prejudiced the safety and security of the United Kingdom.\""

      "Greek officials say that four migrants, including two children, died when a boat struck rocks near the Greek island of Samos",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Four people, including two children, died after a boat carrying migrants ran aground on a rocky shoreline of Samos, the second shipwreck this week on the eastern Greek island, officials said Thursday.",
      "Sixteen people were rescued, but it remained unclear how many were aboard the boat. The Greek coast guard launched a search-and-rescue operation involving patrol vessels, lifeboats, and land teams to locate any potential missing passengers.",
      "A Greek government official said he expected the risk facing migrants to rise over the winter months, and blamed conflicts in the Middle East for a swell in illegal crossings this year.",
      "On Monday, eight migrants \u2014 six children and two women \u2014 died in a shipwreck off Samos.",
      "Samos and other Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea are key transit points for migrants crossing from Turkey to the European Union, with a rise in arrivals in recent months that Greek authorities say is linked to ongoing wars in the Middle East and parts of Africa.",
      "\u201cThe conditions are certainly not favorable,\u201d Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told private Skai television Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey do not tend towards reducing the flow of migrants, but rather increasing them \u2014 with all the geopolitical turmoil, especially in the Middle East, with ongoing wars and other issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Panagiotopoulos said he expected the risk of tragedies in the eastern Aegean to increase in the coming weeks as weather conditions worsen, and added that Greece will renew efforts to seek European Union funding for border wall construction under the next Polish presidency of the EU, which starts on Jan. 1.",
      "Separately, police announced on Thursday the arrest of nine people accused of operating a smuggling ring that allegedly provided migrants with false and illegally used documents to travel to western European cities.",
      "The group, active since July, provided migrants with safe housing, clothing, and travel documents before escorting them to Athens International Airport, police said. Fees for those services ranged from 3,000 to 5,000 euros ($3,150 to 5,250).",
      "Also on Thursday, the Greek coast guard said it had arrested a Syrian man on suspicion of ferrying 5 adults and 13 children by speedboat from Turkey to Samos. The boat was intercepted just off the island on Wednesday, a coast guard statement said, and its occupants were taken to the port of Karlovassi on Samos.",
      "According to United Nations data, some 56,000 migrants have illegally entered Greece so far this year \u2014 mostly in small boats from Turkey \u2014 compared to roughly 48,000 for the whole of 2023.",

      "The unmined gold would be \u201cwealth that could transform El Salvador,\u201d he wrote on the social platform X. Bukele's party controls El Salvador's Congress by a wide margin and his political opposition has been devastated, so a formal proposal to end the ban is unlikely to meet much resistance.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- The United States has imposed sanctions on an additional 21 allies of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing them on Wednesday of perpetrating some of the repression with which officials in the country responded to July's disputed presidential election.",
      "The security and cabinet-level officials sanctioned by the Department of the Treasury include the head of the nation's corrections agency, the director of an intelligence service and the minister of Maduro\u2019s Office of the President. They joined a list of dozens of sanctioned Venezuelans that includes the head of the country\u2019s high court, ministers and prosecutors.",
      "The Biden administration last week recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela's president-elect. The U.S. also on Wednesday placed visa restrictions on additional individuals it accused of repressing Venezuelans after the July 28 election.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of vote tallies.

      "A government official says Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products",
      "TORONTO -- Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official said Wednesday.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "But Trump posted Wednesday evening on Truth Social that he had a \u201cwonderful conversation\" with new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico.\u201d",
      "\u201cMexico will stop people from going to our Southern Border, effective immediately. THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD STOPPING THE ILLEGAL INVASION OF THE USA. Thank you!!!\u201d Trump posted.",
      "It was unclear what impact the conversation will have on Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs.",
      "In Canada, a government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "Another product on the list was whiskey, which comes from Tennessee and Kentucky, the latter of which is the home state of then-Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "Trump made the threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about a influx north of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border pale in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials argue their country is not the problem and that tariffs will have severe implications for both countries.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014",
      "A social media ban for children under 16 passed the Australian Senate Thursday and will soon become a world-first law.",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",

      "The House has yet to endorse opposition amendments made in the Senate. But that is a formality since the government has already agreed they will pass.",

      "Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been \u201crushed.\u201d",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law\u2019s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.",
      "\u201cThe social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice \u2013 the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "The amendments bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "The House is scheduled to pass the amendments on Friday. Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,\u201d she told the AP in an email.",
      "Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage.",
      "\u201cI have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today\u2019s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,\u201d Holdsworth told the AP in an email.",
      "Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people\u2019s mental health and sense of connection.",
      "\u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,\u201d Stone said in a statement.",
      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

      "The culture of the humble \u201cW\u00fcrstelstand\u201d became this week one of the latest additions to the national list of intangible cultural heritage, overseen by the Austrian UNESCO Commission. It joins the Austrian capital's distinctive wine taverns, or \u201cHeurigen,\u201d which have been listed since 2019, and the city's famous coffee house culture, which was honored in 2011.",

      "\u201cOriginally it was just a bucket with hot water in which the sausages used to swim,\" he said. They were sold from \"small carriages drawn by dogs and bigger ones drawn by horses, later by a VW bus or a tractor to their spot.\u201d",
      "The tradition goes back to the pre-World War I days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when former soldiers set up mobile cookshops to make a living. The city\u2019s longest-lived stall in a fixed location, W\u00fcrstelstand Leo, has been serving up sausages since 1928. The stands developed into a bigger institution after wider-ranging permission for fixed stalls was granted in 1969.",
      "It was then that the griddle was introduced and the cheesy K\u00e4sekrainer invented, Bitzinger said. \"Today that\u2019s already a classic.\u201d",
      "The UNESCO designation \u201chonors the tradition, the hospitality and the diversity of our city,\u201d Mayor Michael Ludwig said in a statement.",

      "Bitzinger said that \u201cwe have been fighting a long time for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe special thing about it is that it\u2019s a form of gastronomy everybody can afford,\" he said. \"Here the general director and, during the opera ball, a celebrity stands next to a worker and the street sweeper who just finished cleaning the street. That unites people.\u201d",

      "The idea, said the chapel\u2019s theological assistant, was to recognize the growing importance of artificial intelligence in human lives, even when it comes to religion, and explore the limits of human trust in a machine.",
      "After the two-month run of the \u201cDeus in Machina\u201d exhibit at Peter\u2019s Chapel starting in late August, some 900 conversations from visitors \u2013- some came more than once \u2013- were transcribed anonymously. Those behind the project said it was largely a success: Visitors often came out moved or deep in thought, and found it easy to use.",
      "A small sign invited visitors to enter a confessional -\u2013 chosen for its intimacy \u2013- and below a lattice screen across which penitent believers would usually speak with a priest, a green light signaled the visitor's turn to speak, and a red one came on when \u201cAI Jesus\u201d on a computer screen on the other side was responding.",
      "Often, a lag time was needed to wait for the response \u2013 a testament to the technical complexities. After exiting, nearly 300 visitors filled out questionnaires that informed the report released Wednesday.",

      "An AI video generator from Heygen was used to produce voice and video from a real person, he said. Haslbauer said no specific safeguards were used \u201cbecause we observed GPT-4o to respond fairly well to controversial topics.\u201d",

      "Most visitors described themselves as Christians, though agnostics, atheists, Muslims, Buddhists and Taoists took part too, according to a recap of the project released by the Catholic parish of Lucerne.",
      "About one-third were German speakers, but \u201cAI Jesus\u201d \u2014 which is conversant in about 100 languages \u2014 also had conversations in languages like Chinese, English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Russian and Spanish.",
      "\u201cWhat was really interesting (was) to see that the people really talked with him in a serious way. They didn\u2019t come to make jokes,\u201d said chapel theologian Marco Schmid, who spearheaded the project. Most visitors were aged 40 to 70, and more Catholics respondents found the experience stimulating than did Protestants, the report showed.",
      "Schmid was quick to point out that the \u201cAI Jesus\u201d \u2013 billed as a \u201cJesus-like\u201d persona \u2013 was an artistic experiment to get people thinking about the intersection between the digital and the divine, not substitute for human interaction or sacramental confessions with a priest, nor was it intended to save pastoral resources.",
      "\u201cFor the people it was clear that it was a computer ... It was clear it was not a confession,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t programmed to give absolutions or prayers. At the end, it was more summary of the conversation.\u201d",
      "The Catholic Church from the Vatican on down has been wrestling with the challenges \u2013- and possible opportunities -\u2013 presented by the explosion in public interest in AI since generative artificial intelligence captured the world\u2019s attention two years ago when OpenAI's ChatGPT made its debut.",
      "The Vatican has appointed a friar from a medieval Franciscan order as its top expert on AI, and a Lutheran church in Bavaria served up sermons delivered by a chatbot last year. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message for this year, pushed for an international treaty to ensure the ethical use of AI technology.",
      "Chatbots like ChatGPT are powered by algorithmic models trained on vast pools of text and other data to mimic speech and generate seemingly unique and human-like responses.",
      "Haslbauer is sensitive to public reaction and has noted chatter on social media saying the project is \u201cblasphemous\u201d or the \u201cwork of the devil.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you read comments on the internet about it, some are very negative \u2014 which is scary,\u201d Haslbauer, whose long-haired look featured as a basis for the image of the virtual Jesus.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in the chapel, Haslbauer queried \u201cAI Jesus\u201d about its message for a troubled world, and about whether AI could be helpful as a way for people to find God.",
      "\u201cAll knowledge and wisdom ultimately come from God,\" the chatbot said in a soothing voice, after a pause to respond, and the image briefly crackled. \u201cIf used wisely, AI can indeed be a tool to explore the wonders of creation, deepen our understanding of Scripture, and foster connections among people.\u201d",
      "\"Yet it remains essential to seek God with all your heart and soul beyond any technology,\u201d it added.",
      "Kenneth Cukier, a journalist, author and expert with the U.S.-based nonprofit group called \u201cAI and Faith,\u201d said if \u201cAI Jesus\u201d helps people connect deeper to themselves and the world, it \u201chas to be a good thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will lead to better individuals and a better world,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever \u2014 and there\u2019s a big however \u2014 this does feel a little bit infantile, and pardon my pun, machine-like.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe risk is that it pulls people, ultimately, farther away from that which is more meaningful, deeper and authentic in spirituality,\u201d said Cukier, co-author of \u201cBig Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Work, Live and Think.\u201d",
      "For Schmid, the exhibit was a pilot project \u2014 and he doesn't foresee a second coming of \u201cAI Jesus\u201d anytime soon.",
      "\u201cFor us, it was also clear it was just a limited time that we will expose this Jesus,\" he said, adding that any return would need to be done after deeper thought.",
      "\u201cWe are discussing ... how we could revive him again,\" he said, noting interest from parishes, schoolteachers, researchers and others as the project got media attention in Switzerland and beyond. \u201cThey all are interested and would like to have this \u2018AI Jesus\u2019. So we have now a little bit to reflect on how we want to continue.\"",

      "Syria's opposition groups say armed forces launched a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces and seized territory in northwestern Syria",
      "Syrian armed groups launched a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces and seized territory in northwestern Syria, opposition groups said Thursday. The government and its allies responded with airstrikes and shelling to ward off the insurgent advances, activists said.",
      "The violence has displaced thousands of families, and forced aid groups to suspend some of their services. Volunteers with the Syrian Civil Defense, known as the White Helmets, said at least 18 people, including three children and two women, were killed in two different villages in western Aleppo following airstrikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the airstrikes were from Russian warplanes.",
      "Syria\u2019s armed forces said Thursday the offensive was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which controls much of northwest Syria and is a violation of a de-escalation agreement. It said the attacks are ongoing and have targeted a number of villages and military bases.",
      "Turkey, which backs Syrian opposition factions, and Russia and Iran, which have backed government forces, reached an agreement in late 2019 that effectively froze the line of the conflict and prevented government advances in Idlib province, which has been the last stronghold for a mix of radical groups and Turkey-backed Syrian forces.",
      "\u201cOur forces are confronting the terrorist organizations with different power and in collaboration with friendly forces to ensure the situation returns to how it was,\" the army statement said.",
      "Opposition factions launched the offensive early Wednesday and claimed in a series of statements on social media that they have wrestled control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo, capturing a military base and hardware, and taking a number of soldiers hostage.",
      "The offensive expanded Thursday to reach the countryside of Idlib province, where government forces control a major highway and a strategic town that was previously held by the insurgents, the armed groups and the Syrian Observatory said. The Associated Press could not independently verify those claims.",
      "The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks.",
      "The offensive follows weeks of simmering violence in the area, where activists said government and allied Russian forces have stepped up their bombardment of parts of the last remaining stronghold of the opposition.",
      "The International Rescue Committee said at least 7,000 families have been newly displaced by the escalating hostilities and some schools and health facilities have been forced to suspend services, including IRC's own field operations.",
      "The offensive also came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah, the lead group in the Iran-backed alliance, have been locked in a war that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days.",
      "Formerly known as the Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, HTS later changed its name several times and distanced itself from al-Qaida.",
      "Russia, along with Iran, backed Syrian government forces soon after the anti-government protests in 2011 turned into a war. Turkey has backed an array of opposition forces and established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Meanwhile, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants largely in the east of the country.",
      "Turkey said Thursday it was closely monitoring the offensive launched by the opposition groups in northern Syria. Unnamed defense ministry officials quoted in the state-run Anadolu Agency said Thursday the Turkish military had taken \u201call kinds of measures\u201d to protect its troops in Syria.",
      "Turkish security officials said on Thursday that Syrian opposition groups initially launched a \u201climited\u201d offensive towards Aleppo, from where attacks targeting civilians originated. However, the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions.",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said opposition groups in Idlib had long planned an offensive to expel Syrian government forces and militias from the area to protect civilians. Turkey had previously prevented these operations to avoid escalating tensions in the region, especially amid Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The officials indicated that the offensive proceeded after Turkish diplomatic efforts to prevent government attacks were unsuccessful.",
      "The aim of the offensive was to reestablish the boundaries of the de-escalation zone, according to the Turkish officials.",

    "story": [
      "Several states in Brazil are trying to rid themselves of rainforest protections, bowing to pressures from cattle ranchers and soybean growers to cut forest and expand agriculture as much as possible",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Several states in Brazil are trying to rid themselves of rainforest protections, bowing to pressure from cattle ranchers and soybean growers to cut down trees and expand agriculture.",
      "Their efforts run counter to those of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who returned to power last year and has made significant strides in curbing Amazon deforestation. They also threaten Brazil\u2019s commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. Loss of forest is the country\u2019s largest source of carbon emissions.",
      "\u201cWe are detecting a well-coordinated wave of setbacks. The efforts to reduce deforestation remain highly fragile in some regions,\u201d said Alice Thuault, executive director of Instituto Centro de Vida, an environmental nonprofit based in Mato Grosso state. A coalition of organizations that keeps watch on supply chains, the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi), also referred to the trend as \u201ca major setback.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s nine Amazonian states are crucial for preserving forest. Together, they manage almost 220,000 square miles (564,000 square kilometers) of conservation lands and 12,600 square miles (32,600 square kilometers) of public forests that have no protective designation, a total area roughly the size of Ukraine.",
      "In Acre state, a law approved unanimously in August allows the privatization of almost 347 square miles (900 square kilometers) of protected forest, an area approximately the size of New York City. The stated goal is to legalize the status of people who have illegally moved into five forested conservation units.",
      "The state and its leading farmers\u00b4 organizations are finding common cause with Brazil\u00b4s communist party and state lawmaker Edvaldo Magalh\u00e3es. In a speech in August, he said the new environmental legislation, which also lowers penalties for illegal deforestation, will benefit 40,000 small farmers. He said it will increase protected forest area, although he has not said how. Magalh\u00e3es didn't return requests for an interview.",
      "Acre\u2019s new legislation has garnered strong support from agribusiness organizations, which have long advocated for loosening rainforest protections. \u201cThe more forest, the more poverty,\u201d said Assuero Veronez, president of the Federation of Agriculture and Livestock of Acre, during a speech in the state parliament in April 2023.",
      "Veronez, a cattle rancher who migrated from Brazil\u2019s Southeast to Acre, argues that forests don't generate income and they occupy land that could be used for agriculture. \u201cThat hectare of forest \u2014 there is soil underneath it. If we cannot remove the forest, we cannot produce,\u201d he said.",
      "Veronez did not respond to requests for comment from the Associated Press.",
      "Passage of the legislation prompted Acre Environment Secretary Julie Messias to resign. \u201cThe new legislation poses serious risks and may not be constitutional,\" Messias said. It's crucial for people to get legal status, but that has to be done consistent with Brazil's laws on forest conservation, she said. Acre Governor Gladson Cameli signed the law, but delayed its implementation until January 1 to evaluate whether it is legally binding.",
      "The prospect that the protected areas in Acre could be privatized led to a surge in deforestation, according to a satellite image analysis requested by the AP from the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment. From August to October, illegal deforestation in four protected areas surged more than threefold over the year before, to roughly the area of six Central Parks.",
      "The damage was much worse in neighboring Rondonia state, where the Assembly and local government are in court seeking to annul 11 conservation units and reduce two others. In two of them alone, Guajara-Mirim and Soldado da Borracha, fires that were deliberately set destroyed a combined area of 668 square miles (1,730 square kilometers), an area slightly larger than Greater London, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use.",
      "Rondonia state prosecutor Pablo Viscardi said the fires are the work of people who want to gain legal title to the land. They \u201cuse forest fires to \u2018consolidate\u2019 the land-grabbing and/or prevent the regeneration of areas they were expelled from,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "In Rondonia and also in neighboring Mato Grosso, authorities have also ended an important piece of environmental legislation. In the historic Soy Moratorium of 2006, traders and oil producers agreed not to buy soy beans grown on recently deforested land. Environmental groups including Greenpeace and U.S. commodity giant companies Cargill, Bunge and ADM were parties. Now the laws in Mato Grosso, Brazil\u2019s largest soybean and beef-producing state, and Rondonia, force traders and oil producers to exit the agreement.",
      "Another Amazonian state, Para, is pushing a similar initiative. According to Directa, a law consulting company, the bill closely resembles the ones in Mato Grosso and Rondonia, suggesting a coordinated effort to undermine the soy moratorium.",
      "Critics of the moratorium, which include Brazil\u00b4s top soy producer associations, argue that the agreement is illegal because it goes beyond Brazil\u00b4s anti-deforestation laws. In a statement, the government of Mato Grosso said it ceased incentives under the soy moratorium because the state already enforces \u201cthe world\u2019s strictest environmental regulations\u201d and companies that violate national laws will face penalties, just as they would in other countries.",
      "Brazil is the world\u2019s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with almost 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by World Resources Institute. Almost half of Brazil\u2019s carbon emissions come from deforestation. The Amazon is a vital climate regulator, contains the most biodiverse forest in the world plus one-fifth of the world\u00b4s freshwater.",

      "China is the exception. Driven by government subsidies and mandates, vehicles with electric motors, including plug-in hybrids that combine electric and fossil fuel motors, topped 50% of sales in the month of July.",
      "Concerns about range, charging infrastructure and higher prices are sore points among both electric car enthusiasts and skeptics in Europe and the U.S.",
      "Solar panels power charging at Detlef Mueller-Salis' home in Mainz, Germany, so he thought he was all set to go electric. But range concerns, charging times and confusing charging payment methods have proved frustrating.",
      "So after four years, he and his wife sold their Porsche Taycan and Fiat 500 electrics and bought a BMW 5-Series and a Volkswagen Polo, both internal combustion.",
      "The smaller Fiat could run 220 kilometers (136.70 miles) on a charge in summer and 180 in winter, he said, against the manufacturer's specification of 320 kilometers. Constantly checking the battery before quick trips to visit grandchildren and elder parents grew annoying.",
      "So did going on vacation with payment cards from five different charging plans. The Porsche took 30 minutes to charge instead of the 22 minutes advertised, not a huge difference but \u201cnot what the company promised,\u201d said Mueller-Salis, who is retired from a logistics company. Driving fast on the autobahn reduced range so that \u201cyou paid for it with charging time.\u201d",
      "Both retirees in their 70s, Ken and Roxanne Honeycutt mainly drive their used Kia Soul around their town near Oakland, California. They charge the EV, with a range of about 111 miles (179 kilometers), in their garage and don't rely much on public infrastructure. But for longer trips they have to plan fast charging stops ahead of time.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to try it,\u201d Roxanne said of the EV. \u201cSometimes we found that the charging stations don\u2019t always work, they\u2019re broken down, so that gives you a little bit of anxiety if you know okay, I need to charge.\u201d",
      "On one cold, rainy January day, the Soul\u2019s range dropped faster than expected, so they had to stop twice to charge. Another time, they hit multiple non-functioning chargers \u2014 even in California, where EV adoption leads the rest of the country. Their range dropped to 13 miles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to having a gas station on every corner, 24 hours a day,\u201d Roxanne said, adding they still like the vehicle.",

      "U.S. EV prices have fallen significantly since 2022, but the average price in October for a new one, $56,902, still exceeded the average $48,623 for a new vehicle. Cost remains an issue for the more mainstream American consumers EV makers hope to target, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.",
      "Uncertainty over purchase subsidies also complicates price comparisons.",
      "EV sales plunged in Germany early this year after the government abruptly cancelled the purchase premium of 6,750 euros for cars up to 40,000 euros and 4,500 euros for cars up to 65,000 euros. ADAC says that means most internal combustion models are a better deal over a car's lifetime.",
      "Conservative political parties and the industry are now questioning the EU\u2019s goal of eliminating most fuel engine vehicles by 2035, a decision that\u2019s up for review in 2026.

The government is encouraging car buyers to go electric, and many are buying EVs or plug-in hybrids under an economic stimulus program.",
      "The phasing out of earlier subsidies in 2022 unleashed a fierce price war, toppling some weaker automakers. Some Chinese EVs sell for less than $20,000 in their home market.",

      "The update followed a report on Tuesday from the Conference Board that said confidence among U.S. consumers improved in November, but not by as much as economists expected.",
      "Consumers have been driving economic growth, but the latest round of earnings reports from retailers shows a mixed and more cautious picture.",
      "Department store operator Nordstrom fell 8.1% after warning investors about a trend toward weakening sales that started in late October. Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters jumped 18.3% after beating analysts\u2019 third-quarter financial forecasts. Weeks earlier, retail giant Target gave investors a discouraging forecast for the holiday season, while Walmart provided a more encouraging forecast.",
      "Consumers, though resilient, are still facing pressure from inflation. The latest update from the U.S. government shows that inflation accelerated last month. The personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, rose to 2.3% in October from 2.1% in September.",
      "Overall, the rate of inflation has been falling broadly since it peaked more than two years ago. The PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, was just below 7.3% in June of 2022. Another measure of inflation, the consumer price index, peaked at 9.1% at the same time.",
      "The latest inflation data, though, is a sign that the rate of inflation seems to be stalling as it falls to within range of the Fed's target of 2%. The central bank started raising its benchmark interest rate from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023 and held it there in order to tame inflation.",
      "The Fed started cutting its benchmark interest rate in September, followed by a second cut in November. Wall Street expects a similar quarter-point cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in December.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s data shouldn\u2019t change views of the likely path for disinflation, however bumpy,\" said David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard Asset Management. \"But a lot of observers, probably including some at the Fed, are looking for reasons to get more hawkish on the outlook given the potential for inflationary policy change like new tariffs.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China when he takes office in January. That could shock the economy by raising prices on a wide range of goods and accelerating the rate of inflation. Such a shift could prompt the Fed to rethink future cuts to interest rates.",
      "Treasury yields slipped in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.25% from 4.30% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely follows expected actions by the Fed, fell to 4.22% from 4.25% late Tuesday.",
      "U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will reopen for a half day on Friday."

      "Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation\u2019s steady decline over the past two years has stalled",
      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation's steady decline over the past two years has stalled in recent months.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, consumer prices rose 2.3% in October from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That is up from just 2.1% in September, though it is still only modestly above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called \u201ccore\u201d prices also picked up, climbing 2.8% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September, according to Commerce's personal consumption expenditures price index. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply since it peaked at 7% in mid-2022, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Yet yearly core inflation has fluctuated between 2.6% and 2.8% since February. Price increases have remained elevated in services, including apartment rents, restaurant meals, and car and home insurance.",
      "The elevated reading could make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut its key rate at the next meeting in December. Next month's inflation data, some of which will be issued a week before the meeting, may play a key role in the Fed's decision.",
      "\u201cThis report will likely provide further ammo to Fed officials who prefer to lower rates gradually,\u201d Omair Sharif, chief economist at Inflation Insights, wrote in a client note, \u201cand may strengthen the argument for a pause at the December FOMC meeting.\u201d",
      "Many economists, however, expect that the Fed will reduce its rate by a quarter-point in December, then delay further cuts while gauging the impact of the reductions they've made so far.",
      "\u201cThe momentum in inflation toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target has sputtered recently but not enough, in our view, to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates in December,\u201d Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a client note.",
      "Last month, grocery prices barely rose and gas costs fell, providing some relief to household budgets. Prices at the pump have continued to decline since October, reaching a nationwide average of $3.07 a gallon Wednesday, down six cents from a month earlier, according to AAA.",
      "Used car and truck prices, however, shot up 2.8% from September to October, though they are still 5% lower than a year ago. Air fares jumped 1.5% just last month and have risen 5.1% from a year earlier, while hotel room prices rose 0.5% from September to October. Restaurant prices moved up 0.3% in October and 3.6% from a year earlier. All the yearly increases are higher than they were pre-pandemic.",
      "Wednesday's report also underscored that Americans' incomes and spending remained healthy, a key reason the economy has kept growing this year despite widespread fears of a slowdown. Incomes grew 0.6% from September to October, faster than economists had expected, while consumer spending rose by a solid 0.4% last month.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory could also slow Fed rate cuts. His proposals to cut taxes and reduce government regulation could spur faster growth, but could also overheat the economy and lift inflation. And his threats to impose widespread tariffs, if carried out, would likely push up prices.",
      "The Fed had signaled it would cut rates four times next year, but financial markets now expect just two reductions.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump is turning to two officials with experience navigating not only Washington but the key issues of income taxes and tariffs as he fills out his economic team.",
      "Trump on Tuesday announced he has chosen international trade attorney Jamieson Greer to be his U.S. trade representative and Kevin Hassett as director of the White House National Economic Council.",
      "While Trump has in several cases nominated outsiders to key posts, these picks reflect a recognition that his reputation will likely hinge on restoring the public\u2019s confidence in the economy.",
      "The president-elect also announced a number of other key personnel choices, including Vince Haley, who led Trump's speechwriting department in his first term, as director of the Domestic Policy Council.",
      "Trump said in a statement that Greer was instrumental in his first term in imposing tariffs on China and others and replacing the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, \u201ctherefore making it much better for American Workers.\u201d",
      "Greer previously served as chief of staff to Robert Lighthizer, Trump's former trade representative who is deeply skeptical of free trade. Greer is currently a partner at the King & Spalding law firm in Washington. He was not immediately available for comment.",
      "If confirmed as trade representative, Greer would be responsible for negotiating directly with foreign governments on trade deals and disputes, as well as memberships in international trade bodies such as the World Trade Organization.",
      "He told The New York Times in June that the view of Trump officials was that tariffs \u201ccan help support U.S. manufacturing jobs in particular, especially to the extent that they\u2019re remediating an unfair trade practice.\u201d",
      "His nomination comes a day after Trump promised to slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States \u2014 including a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China \u2014 as one of his first executive orders.",
      "As director of the White House National Economic Council, Hassett brings into Trump's administration a major advocate for tax cuts.",
      "Trump said Hassett \u201cwill play an important role in helping American families recover from the inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration\u201d and that together they would \u201crenew and improve\u201d the 2017 tax cuts, many of which are set to expire after 2025.",
      "Hassett, 62, served in the first Trump term as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He has a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania and worked at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute before joining the Trump White House in 2017.",
      "As part of Hassett\u2019s farewell announcement in 2019, Trump called him a \u201ctrue friend\u201d who did a \u201cgreat job.\u201d Hassett became a fellow at the Hoover Institution, which is located at Stanford University. He later returned to the administration to help deal with the pandemic.",
      "In Trump's second term, Hassett would join a White House seeking to preserve and expand its 2017 tax cuts at a time when deficit pressures are weighing on federal borrowing costs.",
      "He has argued that the tax cuts helped to meaningfully boost household incomes. Inflation-adjusted median household incomes jumped more than $5,400 in 2019 to $81,210. But the tax cuts also came with higher budget deficits as any economic gains failed to offset lost revenues, setting up a challenge for the incoming Trump administration to manage the debt even as it cuts taxes and seeks to hold down inflation.",
      "Also included in Tuesday's nomination announcements was private investor, campaign donor and art collector John Phelan, chosen to serve as Navy secretary. Phelan co-founded MSD Capital, the private investment firm for Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies. It is unclear whether Phelan served in the Navy or military.",

      "This time, though, his tariff threats might be different.",
      "The president-elect is talking about going much bigger \u2014 on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he'll do what he says and what the consequences could be.",
      "\u201cThere's going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he's pretty clear,\u201d said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing.",
      "The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump\u2019s team negotiated during his initial term. But on Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "Trump also posted on Monday that Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.",
      "Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president\u2019s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries.",
      "Sheinbaum initially said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs \u201cif the situation comes to that.\u201d Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump takes action.",
      "House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans' coming control of both the House and Senate.",
      "\"This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,\u201d said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.",
      "But for Trump, tariffs are now a tested tool that seems less politically controversial even if the mandate he received in November's election largely involved restraining inflation.",
      "The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world's second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump's tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly.",
      "Tariffs were \u201cso new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,\u201d said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina.",
      "His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods.",
      "Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its \u201csoft power\u201d as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies.",
      "The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically.",
      "When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records.",
      "While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared with the overall economy. America's gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP.",
      "The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts.",
      "If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.",
      "Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump's tariffs \u2014 if they're imposed \u2014 as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China \u2014 that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,\u201d said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.",

      "Earlier this month, the CEO of Australian company Resolute Mining and two employees were arrested in Mali's capital, Bamako. They were released after the company paid $80 million to Malian authorities to resolve a tax dispute and promised to pay a further $80 million in the coming months.",
      "Mali is one of Africa\u2019s leading gold producers, but it has struggled for years with jihadi violence and high levels of poverty and hunger.

      "Electric vehicles are growing in popularity but still make up a small percentage of total car sales. More than two decades of vehicle and infrastructure development have yielded only a 6.8% market share for EVs in the United States. Part of the problem is range anxiety \u2014 owners\u2019 fear that they won\u2019t be able to get where they need to go on a full charge. But as charging stations proliferate and EV range increases, that fear should fade. To help, Edmunds\u2019 experts have compiled a list of five of the highest-range electric vehicles available for less than $50,000. The vehicles on this list are specific trims and configurations that offer the most range for the least money.",
      "The range ratings listed below are a combination of EPA and manufacturer estimates. Edmunds does its own independent EV range testing, which can be found on its website. Prices listed here include destination charges.",
      "With an ultra-low starting price, the Equinox EV is both affordable and practical. Chevy estimates its range at 319 miles. That, of course, is not a formal EPA estimate, but it\u2019s identical to what the EPA estimated for the Equinox with this powertrain for 2024. The big difference for 2025 is a significantly lower starting price for a car with fewer features and slightly more power. Still, the Equinox includes several meaningful driver assist features, such as automated emergency braking and rear parking sensors, as standard.",
      "Equinox LT FWD price: $34,995",
      "A max 320-mile EPA range rating helps make Ford\u2019s iconically named EV reasonably practical. The Mach-E charges slower than other EVs in this price range, but it\u2019s more engaging to drive than many competitors. Its hatchback body and low ride height represent a practical middle ground between a sedan and an SUV. There are also multiple powertrains available, including a more powerful GT version and a shorter-range variant that costs less. Overall, the Mach-E represents an attractive, fun and utilitarian EV for the money.",
      "Mach-E Premium Extended Range RWD price: $48,990",
      "With up to 342 miles of EPA-estimated range and a sub-$44,000 starting price, the Ioniq 6 is a masterfully utilitarian electric sedan. Part of its appeal is compatibility with the latest quick-charging technology, which Hyundai says allows it to charge from 10% to 80% in less than 18 minutes. It can also fully replenish its battery on a home charger in less than seven hours. Edmunds verified Hyundai\u2019s charging claims, but as always, they are condition-dependent. Though the Ioniq\u2019s styling may not be for everyone, there\u2019s no denying the appeal of Hyundai\u2019s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:58:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Two of London&rsquo;s most famous markets &mdash; one selling fish, the other meat &mdash; are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times",
    "story": [
      "Two of London\u2019s most famous markets \u2014 one selling fish, the other meat \u2014 are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times",
      "LONDON -- Two of London's most famous markets \u2014 one selling fish, the other meat \u2014 are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times.",
      "On Wednesday, the City of London Corporation, the governing body in the capital city's historic hub, is set to present a bill to Parliament to bring an end to its responsibilities to operate the Billingsgate fish market and the Smithfield meat market, both of which have existed in some shape or form since the 11th century.",
      "That comes a day after the corporation decided not to relocate the markets to a new development just east of London in Dagenham.",
      "It abandoned the planned move because of the growing expense, both as a result of the recent bout of inflation and an increase in construction costs \u2014 at around 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion), as things stand.",
      "Instead, under a new agreement with market traders, the corporation will provide financial compensation and advice. The traders have a bit of time to work out what to do, with operations continuing until at least 2028.",
      "\u201cThis decision represents a positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate Markets in that it empowers Traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals,\" said Chris Hayward, the policy chairman of the City of London Corporation. \u201cBy stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently.\u201d",
      "The traders will now work out how to relocate to wherever they wish to in London, potentially on their own or within groups.",
      "No doubt, wherever they end up, their place of work will be shiny and new. But it will be lacking in tradition.",
      "At Smithfield, the market traders typically begin work at 10 p.m., selling mainly to the restaurant trade, and finish up at about 6 a.m., just as the rest of the city is waking up. Pubs around the market traditionally had special licenses allowing them to open in the early hours of the morning to serve the traders.",
      "Peter Ackroyd, who wrote the seminal \u201cLondon: The Biography\u201d in 2000, said the Billingsgate fish market has its roots in the early 11th century, before William the Conqueror turned up with his Norman troops in England to bring an end to Saxon times. Smithfield, built just beyond the old Roman wall, became the go-to place for the sale of horses, sheep and cattle later that century.",
      "Ackroyd describes how, for hundreds of years, Smithfield and Billingsgate, as well as other markets selling flowers, fruit and vegetables, and poultry, were woven into the fabric of London life, though often known for drunkenness, general rowdiness and violence. The great British author Charles Dickens described Smithfield, for example, as a center of \u201cfilth and mire,\u201d referencing the market in both \u201dOliver Twist\" and \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d",
      "With the advent of food standards and regular rebuilds, the markets are clearly not as squalid as they were in medieval times.",
      "But another costly rebuilding was looming. Smithfield's buildings date from Victorian times, with some modifications, and suffered a major fire in 1958, while Billingsgate has been at its current site in London Docklands since 1982, a district that was then derelict but is now home to the gleaming towers of the Canary Wharf financial district.",
      "There are proposals to build 4,000 much-needed new houses at the Billingsgate site, while Smithfield is set to become a cultural center and will house the new London Museum."

      "NEW YORK -- There\u2019s no easy way to bridge the political divides that have created rifts in communities, families and friendships.",
      "But workplace morale and productivity can take a hit when ideological differences are left to fester, affecting teamwork and feelings of mutual respect. Finding a safe space to process emotions while remaining civil can be a delicate balancing act.",
      "While talking politics with colleagues can be fortifying, the opposite also can be true when we disagree. Being exposed to strongly held beliefs that run counter to one\u2019s own values can lead to people feeling mistreated or unsafe. This month's U.S. presidential election heightened those tensions.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "Residents of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast endured two major hurricanes and a tropical storm in the span of nine weeks, and they are still feeling the economic shockwaves",
      "Cecilia Grove didn\u2019t work for 38 days after Hurricane Helene's storm surge flooded the kitchen of the restaurant where she waits tables.",
      "The Cottage, a local and tourist favorite on Siesta Key near Sarasota, Florida, might have reopened sooner, but Hurricane Milton made landfall on the key 13 days later.",
      "The wait was excruciating for Grove. The 39-year-old single mother cares for her seven-year-old daughter Aria, who is deaf and depends on cochlear implants, and her father, who lives with them. \u201cI\u2019m one person feeding three of us,\u201d she said.",
      "After draining her savings to pay for car and health insurance, rent, and food, Grove\u2019s options were to tap into a savings account she\u2019d set up for her daughter or start racking up credit card debt.",
      "Instead, she got help from Season of Sharing, a Sarasota-based program that pays essential expenses for households in crises. Since Helene, the fund has spent over $710,000 helping more than 400 families impacted by the storms. It paid Grove's rent for November and December, letting her catch up on past bills.",
      "\u201cIt made me cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn't believe they were willing and able to do that for me.\u201d",
      "Residents of Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast endured two major hurricanes and a tropical storm in the span of nine weeks, and they are still feeling the economic fallout. The disasters aren't just costly for those whose properties were damaged or destroyed. Replacing food that spoiled during power outages, evacuating to a hotel room, and missing weeks of work all strain budgets too.",
      "\u201cAll of those things when put in relationship with how much cash people have on hand are really serious challenges,\u201d said Sara McTarnaghan, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute.",
      "Studies show those blows hit harder for low- and moderate-income households, who may not have savings to fall back on. Renters, the uninsured, and informal or undocumented workers will miss out on certain kinds of help. The consequences of falling behind \u2014 debt, bad credit or even eviction \u2014 long outlast a storm\u2019s immediate aftermath.",
      "Programs like Season of Sharing can help fill the gaps or tie over households while they wait for assistance.",
      "\u201cProviding stability when a family is in chaos is so important,\u201d said Kirsten Russell, vice president of community impact at the Community Foundation of Sarasota County, which sponsors the program. \u201cWhen households rebound, communities rebound.\u201d",
      "People in Sarasota, DeSoto, Manatee and Charlotte counties can apply to Season of Sharing by calling the 211 non-emergency helpline or contacting one of 100 nonprofits in the fund\u2019s network. Case managers help them submit an application. If it\u2019s approved, Season of Sharing pays the bill directly.",
      "The program only pays bills related to housing, transportation, childcare and utilities, but it finds ways to help those facing other disaster-related expenses. If a family needs to replace its flood-damaged washing machine, the fund might cover a mortgage payment to free up funds.",
      "The Community Foundation of Sarasota County and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune founded Season of Sharing 25 years ago. It helps people year round, but it temporarily loosened its application criteria and increased maximum payments in light of this unprecedented hurricane season.",
      "The program is effective in crises because people already know and trust it, said Christina Russi, a fiscal agent for Season of Sharing for over a decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been glitzy. It\u2019s reliable, it\u2019s consistent, it shows up when it needs to be there, and you really can\u2019t ask for more.\"",
      "The rent assistance from Season of Sharing helped Grove stick with her goal of transitioning out of the restaurant industry and getting a more stable career to support her daughter. She recently earned her GED and is taking prerequisite classes for a college program to become an X-ray technician.",
      "\u201cI can continue to focus on my schoolwork, my daughter, and not worry about only money. I can keep going in the direction to better my life because somebody gave me an opportunity to take a breath,\u201d said Grove, who applied for FEMA assistance after Helene, but was denied. She received a $770 FEMA payment after Milton, but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThat\u2019s gone in just a couple days when you\u2019re not working,\u201d she said.",
      "When economically vulnerable households fall behind after a disaster, it can take years for them to recover, if they do so at all. A 2019 Urban Institute study found that four years after a medium-sized disaster, the credit scores of people who had good credit before the disaster had dropped an average of 8 points, but the scores of people who had poor credit had dropped by 29 points.",
      "\u201cWhere things were going bad they kept going bad and worse,\u201d said Daniel Teles, a co-author of the study and principal research associate at the Urban Institute. Studies have also shown higher rates of mortgage delinquencies and evictions for low-income households in the years after a disaster.",
      "Teles said part of the reason for these outcomes is that current disaster-assistance systems don\u2019t catch everyone who needs help. \u201cIt can be their issues navigating the existing aid programs, and then gaps between what the federal aid offers and what people actually need,\u201d he said, adding that changes in public policy are needed to address those shortfalls.",
      "That leaves foundations like the one in Sarasota, and their donors, to fill in those gaps.",
      "The Community Foundation of Sarasota County typically fundraises for Season of Sharing from November through January, but started its campaign a month early in light of Hurricane Helene. It has raised over $3.85 million so far, including $1 million from the Patterson Foundation, $500,000 each from Eliza and Hugh Culverhouse Jr. and the Brian and Sheila Jellison Family Foundation, and $250,000 from the Baltimore Orioles. It's propelled by community support, too: For the last decade, donations of under $100 have made up one-third of gifts.",
      "The number of applications picked up in November, and the foundation is seeing people apply who have never sought help before.",
      "After a hurricane season unlike any her community has seen, Grove said she hopes more people let themselves lean on support. \u201cThe programs are here for a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I stuck to my usual motto of \u2018I\u2019ll figure out a way,\u2019 well you can\u2019t figure out a way when you don\u2019t have money coming in. So if there\u2019s someone willing to help, it\u2019s ok to get the help.\u201d",

      "Other manufacturers across Europe, including Ford and Volkswagen, recently announced plans to close some operations in light of targets they are struggling to meet.",
      "The mandate in the U.K. requires major car manufacturers to have zero-emission \u2014 in effect, purely electric \u2014 vehicles make up 22% of their sales fleet this year, increasing to 28% in 2025 and rising further in subsequent years. If a manufacturer does not hit the targets, it is fined 15,000 pounds ($19,000) for every vehicle that it sells that does not comply with the mandate.",
      "The targets were laid out two years ago by the previous Conservative administration, which set a deadline of 2035 for phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars.",
      "Reynolds confirmed plans to review the ZEV mandate as part of a consultation on the new Labour government\u2019s plan to ban the sale of new \u201cpurely petrol and diesel\u201d cars by 2030.",
      "\u201cCar manufacturers around the world are battling with increased costs, supply chain issues and changing consumer demand in a highly competitive, fast-evolving market,\" he said.",
      "In its manifesto for government ahead of the July 4 election, Labour promised a \u201cphase-out date of 2030 for new cars with internal combustion engines.\u201d That caused industry anxiety over the future of hybrids, which use electric batteries along with petrol or diesel power.",
      "\u201cWe will be shortly fast-tracking a consultation on our manifesto commitment to end the sales of new purely petrol and diesel cars by 2030,\" Reynolds said. \u201cBut we will use that consultation to engage with industry on the previous government\u2019s ZEV transition mandate and the flexibilities contained within it.\u201d",
      "His use of the term \u201cpurely\u201d has been interpreted as suggesting that hybrid vehicles can still be sold after 2030.",
      "The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry's lobby group in the U.K., insisted that its members remain \u201ccommitted to delivering a decarbonised road transport sector\u201d but that the ZEV mandate will cost automakers around 6 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) this year alone.",
      "\u201cWe need an urgent review of the automotive market and the regulation intended to drive it,\u201d the group's chief executive Mike Hawes said. \u201cNot because we want to water down any commitments, but because delivery matters more than notional targets.\u201d",
      "Rather than changing the current rules, environmental campaigners suggest the government should make electric vehicles more appealing, potentially by giving new owners tax advantages or reducing the cost of on-street charging via subsidies.",
      "\"Chopping and changing policies damages consumer demand and undermines investor confidence,\" said Nick Davies, head of climate policy at the London-based Green Alliance."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian Senate was debating a ban on children younger than 16 years old from social media Thursday after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly supported the age restriction.",
      "The bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It is likely to be passed by the Senate on Thursday, the Parliament\u2019s final session for the year and potentially the last before elections, which are due within months.",
      "The major parties\u2019 support for the ban all but guarantees the legislation will become law. But many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie complained about the limited amount of time the government gave the Senate to debate the age restriction, which she described as \u201cundercooked.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought this was a good idea. A lot of people out there thought it was a good idea until we looked at the detail and, let's be honest, there's no detail,\u201d Lambie told the Senate.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary.",
      "\u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minor Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly carried the bill 102 votes to 13.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland urged senators to pass the bill which she said reflected the Australian community's view.",
      "\u201cThe ... government is on the side of supporting parents and protecting young people,\u201d Rowland told the House.",

      "The platforms complained that the law would be unworkable, and urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of general elections due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents' concerns about their children's addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines parental authority to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents of the bill also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety."

      "A government official says Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products",
      "TORONTO -- Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official said Wednesday.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "But Trump posted Wednesday evening on Truth Social that he had a \u201cwonderful conversation\" with new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and she \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico.\u201d",
      "\u201cMexico will stop people from going to our Southern Border, effective immediately. THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD STOPPING THE ILLEGAL INVASION OF THE USA. Thank you!!!\u201d Trump posted.",
      "It was unclear what impact the conversation will have on Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs.",
      "In Canada, a government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",

      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about a influx north of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border pale in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials argue their country is not the problem and that tariffs will have severe implications for both countries.",

About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, rose this week. The average rate climbed to 6.1% from 6.02% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.56%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which lenders use as a guide to price home loans. The yield, which mostly hovered around 4.4% last week and was below 3.70% in September, has eased this week. It was at 4.23% at midday Wednesday.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. U.S. home sales are on track for their worst year since 1995.",
      "\u201cThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage moved down this week, but not by much,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist. \u201cPotential homebuyers are also waiting on the sidelines, causing demand to be lackluster. Despite the low sales activity, inventory has only modestly improved and remains dramatically undersupplied.\u201d",
      "Mortgage rates slid to just above 6% in September following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. The central bank\u2019s policy pivot is expected to eventually clear a path for mortgage rates to generally go lower. But that could change if the next administration\u2019s policies send inflation into overdrive again.",
      "September\u2019s pullback in mortgage rates helped drive a pickup in sales of previously occupied U.S. homes last month, and likely helped give a boost to demand early last month.",
      "The National Association of Realtor\u2019s pending home sales index rose 2% in October from the previous month, its third straight monthly increase, the trade group said Wednesday. Pending transactions were up 5.4% compared to October last year.",
      "A lag of a month or two usually exists between when a contract is signed and when the home sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Still, because mortgage rates have mostly kept rising in recent weeks, that could dampen sales this month and next in what's already typically a slow season for the housing market.",
      "\u201cThough mortgage rates are likely to decline in the coming weeks, the dip will be too little and too late to boost home sales in December,\u201d said Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Forecasting the trajectory of mortgage rates is difficult, given that rates are influenced by many factors, from government spending and the economy, to geopolitical tensions and stock and bond market gyrations.",
      "Economists predict that mortgage rates will remain volatile this year, but generally forecast them to hover around 6% in 2025.",

      "Minnesota Frost defenseman Claire Thompson is no typical rookie preparing for her first PWHL season",
      "It didn\u2019t take long for Claire Thompson\u2019s Minnesota Frost teammates to conjure up a nickname for the rookie defenseman with a knack for offensive play-making and a sharp analytical mind.",
      "\u201cWe call her, 'The Human ChatGPT,\u2019\u201d Grace Zumwinkle said, before fellow Frost forward Taylor Heise chimed in.",
      "\u201cWe had meetings last night and we\u2019re like, \u2018What\u2019s your consensus on what happened? Give us the SparkNotes,\u2019\u201d Heise said, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s such a cognitive person. I just feel like she has a lot going on up there.\u201d",
      "At 26, Thompson isn\u2019t your typical rookie in preparing to make her PWHL debut on Sunday when the defending-champion Frost open their season hosting New York. After spending last year pursuing her medical degree at NYU, the Princeton graduate traded her stethoscope for a hockey stick to resume an already successful playing career.",
      "At Princeton, Thompson finished fifth on the Tigers career list of blue-liners with 87 points (31 goals) in 129 games, while gathering numerous conference accolades for her play and studies. Thompson turned heads at the 2022 Beijing Games, where she helped Canada win gold and finished with two goals and 11 assists to shatter the single-tournament record for points by a defenseman.",
      "Her return to hockey coincides with the Olympic cycle, with Thompson seeking the opportunity to represent Canada at the 2026 Games in Italy. She was selected third overall by Minnesota in the draft in June, and has since rejoined Team Canada, picking up an assist in three games in the Rivalry Series against the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think always in the back of your mind there are going to be what-ifs going on, and so I was happy to put those all to rest,\u201d Thompson said of her relatively seamless return.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anything's surprised me,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun being back on the ice. I think I miss being in a team environment every single day and collectively working toward a shared goal.\u201d",
      "That isn\u2019t to suggest Thompson has put her medical studies aside entirely. She\u2019s working on as many medical projects as she can comfortably handle in her spare time.",
      "Thompson isn't so much torn between medicine and hockey, but rather can\u2019t do without both passions.",
      "\u201cI have stayed in very close contact with a lot of my med school classmates, and hearing about their stories. ... So I definitely miss that aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut while I was doing that, I missed this. So it\u2019s great to have two different things that you enjoy so much.\u201d",
      "Welcome to the complex world of Claire Thompson, something her Canadian teammates have become accustomed to, and is now being introduced to a Frost team made up of mostly Americans.",
      "Minnesota captain Kendall Coyne Schofield thought she had it tough last year juggling motherhood and hockey before encountering Thompson.",
      "\u201cNo. You won\u2019t find me in med school. Definitely not. I\u2019ve been lucky to room with her this week, and it\u2019s been fun to ask her a million questions,\u201d she said.",
      "Coyne Schofield was particularly intrigued by what Thompson saw in making a lengthy breakout pass to set up Sarah Nurse for a breakaway during a recent Rivalry Series game.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my goodness.\u2019 And that was a moment where, obviously, we\u2019re on different teams in that situation. And I\u2019m like, \u2019Well, I can\u2019t wait to play with her,'\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s constant plays like that where you\u2019re just like, \u2018Holy cow.\u2019\u201d",
      "Thompson joins a talented core of Frost defensemen, which includes veteran U.S. player Lee Stecklein, Natalie Buchbinder and fellow Canadian Sophie Jaques, college hockey\u2019s 2023 player of the year.",
      "Analytical as Thompson might be, Canadian and Toronto Sceptres coach Troy Ryan praised her fearless approach to taking calculated risks in attempting plays other defensemen might resist in fear of a turnover \u2014 and not getting down if it winds up being a mistake.",
      "One reason Ryan believed Thompson was passed over by the Canadian national team program at the Under-18 stage was because of her gambling style. Ryan would have Thompson play no other way in recalling a conversation he had early into her national team career.",
      "\u201cI think she was expecting me to tell her to dial it back a bit. And I was actually, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to go more,\u2019\u201d Ryan recalled. \u201cI\u2019m a big, big fan of hers. And I find her to be such a unique person with everything that she\u2019s juggling. It\u2019s incredible. And I\u2019m jealous, to be honest.\u201d",
      "Thompson wants to specialize in orthopedic surgery, though she made all the rounds \u2014 pediatrics, psychiatry and neurology \u2014 as part of her clerkship last year while spending nights practicing with the NYU men\u2019s club team.",
      "Now Thompson's focused on hockey \u2014 well, mostly.",
      "\u201cI love to be able to do both things, but unfortunately I can\u2019t be at two places at once,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m young. I\u2019m still able to play hockey at a high level, and I know that won\u2019t always be the case,\u201d Thompson added. \u201cBut people have much longer careers in medicine, so I know when that time comes I have a very good other option to go to.\u201d",

      "The International Tennis Integrity Agency says five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine",
      "Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication known as TMZ, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced Thursday.",
      "Swiatek failed an out-of-competition drug test in August, and the ITIA accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and caused by the contamination of a nonprescription medication, melatonin, that Swiatek was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping.",
      "It was determined her level of fault was \u201cat the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,\u201d the ITIA said.",
      "\u201cThis experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot,\u201d Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, said in a video she posted on social media.",
      "\u201cThe whole thing will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life. It took a lot to return to training after the situation nearly broke my heart, so there were many tears and lots of sleepless nights,\u201d Swiatek said, speaking in Polish with an English translation scrolling across the top of the post. \u201cThe worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all.\u201d",
      "This is the second recent high-profile doping case in tennis: The top-ranked man, Jannik Sinner, failed two tests for a steroid in March and was cleared in August, right before the start of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of the season. Sinner did not miss any competition; the World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed the ruling that exonerated him.",
      "Swiatek reached No. 1 in the WTA rankings for the first time in April 2022, and she remained there much of the time since but is now at No. 2 after being overtaken by Aryna Sabalenka in October.",
      "Swiatek won the French Open in June for her fourth title there and fifth major championship overall, then took home a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August.",
      "\u201cThe WTA fully supports Iga during this difficult time. Iga has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to fair play and upholding the principles of clean sport, and this unfortunate incident highlights the challenges athletes face in navigating the use of medications and supplements,\u201d the women's tennis tour said in a statement. \u201cThe WTA remains steadfast in our support for a clean sport and the rigorous processes that protect the integrity of competition. We also emphasize that athletes must take every precaution to verify the safety and compliance of all products they use, as even unintentional exposure to prohibited substances can have significant consequences.\u201d",
      "Swiatek formally admitted the anti-doping rule violation on Wednesday and accepted her penalty. TMZ is the drug at the center of the case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who remained eligible despite testing positive for performance enhancers in 2021.",
      "Swiatek said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by her test result and had never heard of TMZ. She said she's been using melatonin \u201cfor a long time,\" adding that \u201call my traveling, jet lag and work-related stress mean that sometimes without it, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d",
      "She already was provisionally suspended from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, missing three tournaments during the post-U.S. Open hard-court swing in Asia \u2014 the Korea Open, the China Open and the Wuhan Open.",
      "That provisional ban was ended after her appeal showed that her test result came inadvertently from contaminated melatonin.",
      "Because the ultimate agreement was for a month suspension, she will serve the remaining eight days now, while there\u2019s no competition, and be cleared to return to play as of Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cI can start my new season with a clean slate, focused on what I've always done \u2014 simply playing tennis,\u201d said Swiatek, who hired Wim Fissette as her coach in October.",
      "Swiatek also was fined the prize money of $158,944 that she earned for her semifinal run at the Cincinnati Open in August, the event immediately following the positive test.",
      "\u201cOnce the source of the TMZ had been established, it became clear that this was a highly unusual instance of a contaminated product, which in Poland is a regulated medicine. However, the product does not have the same designation globally, and the fact that a product is a regulated medication in one country cannot of itself be sufficient to avoid any level of fault,\" ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said.",
      "\u201cTaking into account the nature of the medication, and all the circumstances, it does place that fault at the lowest end of the scale,\" Moorhouse said. \"This case is an important reminder for tennis players of the strict liability nature of the World Anti-Doping Code and the importance of players carefully considering the use of supplements and medications.\u201d",

      "Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna\u2019s high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience",
      "SAO PAULO -- Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna's high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience.",
      "The legendary Brazilian driver \u2014 who was killed when his car hit a concrete wall at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 \u2014 is the subject of a six-episode Netflix series that debuts on Nov. 29 and follows him from his early go-kart days to that fatal Sunday afternoon at the Imola track in Italy.",
      "Even three decades after that accident, few F1 figures evoke as much emotion and passion among fans and fellow drivers as Senna, who won three championship titles before his death at the age of 34.",
      "Senna\u2019s complex personality \u2014 he was a saint to his millions of Brazilian fans and a sinner to some critics who deemed his driving style too aggressive \u2014 comes to life through Brazilian actor Gabriel Leone, who embraced the challenge of portraying such a popular figure.",
      "\u201cHe was much more than an F1 driver for us, he became an icon, much beyond his technique and his driving,\u201d Leone told The Associated Press in an interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cHe had this humanity, this honesty. The things he said, his values, it all made him closer to people.\u201d",
      "Senna's life and career had no shortage of made-for-TV moments.",
      "This was a driver who once won a race with his car stuck in sixth gear in front of thousands of raucous fans at the Interlagos track. And who went from fifth position to first in one lap at the 1993 European Grand Prix. And who jumped out of his car during a training session to save the life of a French driver who had crashed.",
      "On the track, his rivalry with French driver Alain Prost was one of the most intense that F1 has ever seen. Off the track, he had some high-profile relationships as well and dated several models, including Elle Macpherson.",
      "\u201cFor me as an actor, the more complex the character is, the better. It is more interesting to build him and live him. And this is quite a character, the biggest hero in Brazil, not only in sport,\u201d Leone said. \u201cAyrton was transcendent, he was more than an F1 driver. That\u2019s a guy who is the hero of great drivers in history, like (Michael) Schumacher and (Lewis) Hamilton.\u201d",
      "Senna won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991 with the McLaren team and moved to Williams in the year he died as the favorite to lift the title again.",
      "For Leone, though, it was also important to portray him as a person who understood his role as a national hero, who advocated for the poor and proudly waved a Brazilian flag from his cockpit during every victory lap.",
      "\u201cHe was not distant, he was close,\" said Leone, who attended a red carpet premiere in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with several other cast members and director Vicente Amorim. \"That\u2019s for Brazilians and non-Brazilians. It was like this, and it still is like this.\u201d",
      "To many international fans, Senna was simply an exceptional talent who was born to be a driver. Even former rival Martin Brundle, now a TV pundit, once likened Senna's ability to find grip on some corners to a dance seemingly innate to a Brazilian.",
      "\u201cIt is a different kind of samba that I could not do,\u201d Brundle has said.",
      "The Netflix series, however, shows some of the hard work and attention to detail that went into Senna becoming a wet-weather master.",
      "The streaming giant \u2014 which reportedly invested more than $170 million in its production \u2014 also takes a bit of liberty with the truth when it comes to building up the animosity between Senna and one of his other real-life antagonists, Jean-Marie Balestre, the French former president of F1's governing body FIA.",
      "Balestre is often accused by fans of aiding his countryman Prost in his rivalry with Senna, including at the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix by stopping the race early before the Brazilian driver could overtake his French rival in the heavy rain. And at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Senna was disqualified in a decision that handed the championship title to Prost.",
      "The Netflix series goes a step further by making Balestre (played by Arnaud Viard) the man responsible for Senna also losing a go-kart title as a youngster, long before he even entered F1.",
      "\u201cIf that was true it would be news to every reporter covering Senna\u2019s story over the last decades,\u201d said Ernesto Rodrigues, who wrote a biography on the three-time F1 champion. \u201cYes, Senna had Balestre working against him many times. But Balestre was an autocrat with other drivers, too. It wasn\u2019t exclusive.\u201d",
      "Prost, played by Matt Mella, goes from being a racing foe to a friend after his retirement in the series just like in real life. The friction between the two as McLaren teammates and then in the title-deciding races in the 1989 and 1990 seasons create some of the best moments of the series for racing fans.",
      "Three of the women in Senna\u2019s life also appear in the series.",
      "Scenes with L\u00edlian de Vasconcellos Souza, who married Senna in 1981 and divorced him the next year, help show how the Brazilian was driven to go into F1 early in his career. Xuxa Meneghel, a wildly popular TV host, is featured for a full episode as the driver\u2019s most important girlfriend. Adriane Galisteu, who was the champion\u2019s girlfriend when he died, appears for less than three minutes.",
      "Senna's importance to today's F1 drivers was on full display at the Brazilian Grand Prix this month, when Hamilton \u2014 the British seven-time F1 champion \u2014 drove one of Senna's old cars around the track as part of the tributes marking the 30th anniversary of his death.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Hamilton said on Nov. 3. \u201cI hope I made Senna proud.\u201d",

Court records show that earlier Monday, members of Boucher's family had filed an eviction notice to remove him from their house.",
      "According to a police report, witnesses heard Hiltebeitel scream, \u201cHe's trying to kill me,\u201d and then saw Boucher beating him with a club on the first fairway. Hiltebeitel tried to run away, but Boucher retrieved another club from Hiltebeitel's bag and chased him into a pond, where he jumped on top of him, choked him and again beat him, police said.",
      "Police Chief Dominick Pape said no connection has been found between Hiltebeitel and Boucher nor is there any immediate evidence of a confrontation or argument before the attack.",
      "After the attack, Boucher stripped off his clothes and fled into the woods. Officers had to use a stun gun to subdue him. Boucher was being held without bond Wednesday after being charged with first-degree murder. He has previous arrests for domestic battery, battery on a police officer and drug possession.",
      "Hiltebeitel, who had owned an organic snack food company, was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "The Palm Beach County Public Defender's Office, which is representing Boucher, did not respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. It has a policy of not commenting on pending cases."

      "No one felt the embarrassment of Madrid\u2019s 2-0 loss at Anfield more than Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the superstar added in the offseason by the storied club that also was European champion against Liverpool in the finals of 2022 and 2018.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9 had a penalty saved in the second half and was earlier dumped on his behind by Conor Bradley\u2019s superb tackle in an instant viral moment.",
      "Only Liverpool has started the new Champions League format with five wins and first-year coach Arne Slot's team is two points clear of Inter Milan. Barcelona is third, trailing Liverpool by three points.",

      "\u201c(This) doesn\u2019t change much, because even with a win it was going to be tough to secure a top-eight finish,\u201d Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. \u201dIt was a fair result.\"",
      "Monaco missed a chance to go second in the table, giving up a lead playing with 10 men from the 58th minute in a 3-2 loss at home to Benfica. Swiss forward Zeki Amdouni scored the winning goal in the 88th.",
      "Borussia Dortmund, the beaten finalist against Madrid in May, is up to fourth place after beating Dinamo Zagreb 3-0. Champions League standout Jamie Gittens now has four goals in five games, curling a rising shot in the 41st to open the scoring in Croatia.",
      "The best comeback was at PSV Eindhoven, where the home team trailed Shakhtar Donetsk by two goals in the 87th minute before a 3-2 win was sealed by United States forward Ricardo Pepi\u2019s goal deep in stoppage time.",
      "US defender Cameron Carter-Vickers scored an embarrassing own goal for Celtic \u2014 playing a no-look pass far beyond goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel \u2014 in a 1-1 draw with Club Brugge.",

      "Mukau scored twice in 12th-place Lille\u2019s 2-1 win at Bologna and Silas leveled for Red Star in a 5-1 rout of Stuttgart, though he barely celebrated his goal. Silas is on loan with the Serbian champion from Stuttgart.",
      "Aston Villa's 0-0 draw with Juventus was preserved by an excellent save by Emiliano Martinez, the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper, diving low to push away a header from Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o.",

      "After Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s penalty was pushed away by goalkeeper Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher in the 61st, Liverpool star Mo Salah missed with his spot-kick in the 70th, before substitute Cody Gakpo sealed the win with a header in the 77th.",
      "Madrid now has lost three of five games after defeats at Lille and at home to AC Milan. The record 15-time European champion has another tough trip next, at fifth-place Atalanta on Dec. 10. On the same date, Liverpool is at 30th-place Girona and looks to be cruising into the round of 16.",

      "Red Star rallied against Stuttgart after the German team led in the fifth minute. The 1991 European Cup winner\u2019s goal to level the game in the 12th was scored by on-loan Silas. He held up his hands as if in apology as part of a low-key celebration.",

      "Sports Business Journal reported last month that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia planned to shift Norman into a new position. Norman has been CEO since LIV Golf launched as a rival league in 2022.",
      "The Athletic cited an anonymous source briefed on the matter saying that O\u2019Neil, who currently is CEO of Merlin Entertainments, would be hired.",
      "Merlin Entertainments, with holdings that include Legoland and the Peppa Pig theme park in Dallas, announced Wednesday that O'Neil was leaving for another opportunity.",
      "O\u2019Neil takes over as PGA Tour Enterprises is negotiating with PIF over becoming a minority investor, a critical deal in helping to repair a golf landscape that has been divided since Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka were among top players who bolted the PGA Tour for a new league that offered team competition, signing bonuses and $20 million purses.",
      "The PGA Tour, European tour and PIF announced an agreement on June 6, 2023, and set a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. That was not met, and the PGA Tour since has brought on Strategic Sports Group with its $1.5 billion investment (which could double in size) and the first equity ownership for players.",
      "PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the PIF governor and backbone of LIV, played together in the Dunhill Links last month. Monahan recently played golf with President-elect Donald Trump, who is close with Al-Rumayyan and whose golf courses were used by LIV Golf.",
      "The hiring of O\u2019Neil might soothe hard feelings toward Norman by most PGA Tour players. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy said two years ago \u2014 before the PGA Tour and PIF announced a framework agreement \u2014 that Norman needed to leave before the sides could come together.",

      "Blake Snell has agreed to a $182 million, five-year contract with the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations",
      "Less than a month after winning the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers are spending big again to add one of baseball's best pitchers to their star-studded roster.",
      "Blake Snell and the Dodgers agreed to a $182 million, five-year contract, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday night because the deal is subject to a successful physical.",
      "The two-time Cy Young Award winner broke the news personally by posting a photo of himself on social media in a Dodgers uniform \u2014 No. 7.",
      "Snell gets a $52 million signing bonus, payable on Jan. 20, and annual salaries of $26 million, of which $13 million each year will be deferred. Because Snell is a Washington state resident, the signing bonus will not be subject to California income tax.",
      "Snell would join two-way star Shohei Ohtani and fellow Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto atop Los Angeles' rotation, giving the Dodgers the first megadeal this offseason following Ohtani's $700 million, 10-year contract and Yamamoto's $325 million, 12-year agreement last offseason.",
      "Ohtani didn't pitch this year while recovering from right elbow surgery but is expected back on the mound in 2025. He won his third MVP award \u2014 first in the National League \u2014 following a huge season at the plate exclusively as a designated hitter.",
      "Yamamoto went 7-2 with a 3.00 ERA in 18 starts as a rookie, then won twice in four October outings.",
      "Down to three healthy starting pitchers during the postseason, Los Angeles overcame a string of injuries to its projected rotation in winning the franchise's second World Series title in five years.",
      "Right-handers Jack Flaherty and Walker Buehler then became free agents this fall, creating more voids on the staff. But the addition of Snell would fill a large one at the top with a legitimate ace.",
      "Snell's $36.4 million average salary would rank as the fifth-highest among active deals next year behind Ohtani ($70 million), Philadelphia pitcher Zack Wheeler ($42 million), New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge ($40 million) and Texas pitcher Jacob deGrom ($37 million). Among expired contracts, it also was exceeded by pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander (both $43.33 million) under deals they agreed to with the New York Mets.",
      "ESPN first reported the details of Snell's contract.",
      "Earlier this month, Snell opted out of his deal with San Francisco to become a free agent for the second consecutive offseason after he was slowed by injuries during his lone year with the Giants.",
      "The left-hander agreed in March to a $62 million, two-year contract that included a $17 million signing bonus payable on Jan. 15, 2026, a $15 million salary for 2024 and a $30 million salary for 2025, of which $15 million would have been deferred and payable on July 1, 2027.",
      "Snell, who turns 32 next week, went 5-3 with a 3.12 ERA in 20 starts this year, throwing a no-hitter at Cincinnati on Aug. 2 for one of only 16 individual shutouts in the major leagues this season. He struck out 145 and walked 44 in 104 innings.",
      "He was sidelined between April 19 and May 22 by a strained left adductor and between June 2 and July 9 by a strained left groin.",
      "Snell won Cy Young Awards in 2018 with Tampa Bay and 2023 with San Diego. He is 76-58 with a 3.19 ERA in nine seasons with the Rays (2016-20), Padres (2021-23) and Giants.",
      "Because he turned down a qualifying offer from San Diego last November, the Giants were not eligible to give Snell another one and won\u2019t receive draft-pick compensation.",
      "Los Angeles expects All-Star right-hander Tyler Glasnow and three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw back in the rotation next year. Other starting candidates if healthy include right-handers Dustin May, Tony Gonsolin and Bobby Miller.",
      "Ohtani is coming off right elbow surgery in September 2023 and left shoulder surgery on Nov. 5.",
      "Glasnow didn\u2019t pitch after Aug. 11 because of right elbow tendinitis.",
      "Kershaw, who turns 37 in March, had foot and knee surgeries on Nov. 7. He declined a $10 million player option in favor of free agency, but is expected to return to Los Angeles.",
      "May is coming back from Tommy John surgery in July 2023 and from an operation this past July to repair a tear in his esophagus.",
      "Gonsolin spent 2024 rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.",
      "Miller, an 11-game winner as a rookie in 2023, was sidelined early this season by shoulder inflammation. He struggled to a 2-4 record with an 8.52 ERA in 13 big league starts and ended the regular season in the minors.",

    "story": [
      "If you want your upcoming album promoted on a huge platform, go to \u201cAmazon Music Live.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If artists want to launch an album with a bang, \u201c Amazon Music Live\u201d could be the end zone to score big.",
      "Some of the biggest performers in music \u2014 including Jelly Roll, Megan Thee Stallion, Ed Sheeran, Kane Brown, Peso Pluma and Lil Baby \u2014 have graced the live stage during the weekly concert series in Los Angeles that airs after the NFL's \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d game on Prime Video. Each show is a unique experience with artists debuting new music on bespoke sets created to bring their vision and style to life.",
      "This season's highlights have included J Balvin 's Latin vibe, Halsey 's Halloween circus intro and Gunna's big money talk. Big Sean was joined onstage by North Carolina A&T State University\u2019s marching band, and Jhene Aiko, YG and E-40 made guest appearances.",
      "Now, it's Snoop Dogg 's turn to take the mic for \u201cAML's\u201d season finale this week, just ahead of his highly anticipated 20th album, \u201cMissionary,\u201d dropping next month. The performances are filmed live in front of more than a thousand audience members and streamed on Prime Video and Amazon's streaming platform, Twitch.",
      "Jelly Roll, a Grammy-nominated country singer, was the \u201cAML\u201d season opener in October just days after the release of his 10th studio album, \u201cBeautifully Broken.\u201d His special guests included Keith Urban, Skylar Grey and Machine Gun Kelly.",
      "\u201cWe could have planned our whole rollout around this,\u201d Jelly Roll said. \u201cI\u2019m always excited to try to share what I do in front of new audiences or hope a new audience sees it or maybe the people at home who couldn\u2019t see the tour or people who bought the album and see what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Last week, TWICE expanded their brand beyond their usual K-pop fandom after the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers. The nine-member group made Amazon Music history. The concert livestream earned the most unique viewers of any production \u2014 including Kendrick Lamar's \u201cPop Out\u201d concert in June, and the Ye and Drake \u201cFree Larry Hoover\u201d show in 2021.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normally used to performing just for our fans who are purposely coming to see us \u2014 especially in the U.S. where we are used to doing that,\u201d said singer Nayeon, who was accompanied by group members Momo, Tzuyu, Mina, Minatozaki Sana, Dahyun, Jihyo, Jeongyeon and Chaeyoung.",
      "TWICE has performed inside major stadiums like MetLife and SoFi Stadium. But \u201cAML\u201d helped introduce them to first-time listeners, while also promoting their upcoming 14th mini-album \u201cStrategy,\u201d releasing Dec. 6.",
      "\u201cFor \u2018Amazon Music Live,\u2019 it\u2019s not just about our fans, but it\u2019s rather related to football,\u201d Nayeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of football fans to see us. To be invited here to perform is such an honor. We need to keep our game card for people to know who TWICE is.\u201d",
      "Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the concert series comes to life and those who play a key role.",
      "When Jelly Roll first entered the \u201cAML\u201d set, the singer thought it was just another rehearsal \u2014 until he found himself immersed in an unexpected interactive experience before stepping on the main stage.",
      "\u201cI was overwhelmed. Got nervous,\u201d said Jelly Roll, who was floored after he initially walked through the Tailgate Experience at the East End Studios in Glendale, California, where \u201cAML\u201d films season three.",
      "The experience offers a variety of attractions including flat-screen TVs above a massive circular bar, a spacious VIP section, photo booth, themed locker room, digital bonfire, featured vehicle, jersey patch station and a towering football toss game. All of this is set to the music of the week's concert series performer blasted through loudspeakers.",
      "\u201cI wanted a space that was intentional and inclusive to everybody,\u201d said Jameka Pankey, the head of events and experiential for artists at Amazon Music. She and her team wanted to make a concerted effort to pay homage to performers and the fans who enjoy their work.",
      "\u201cWe thought about all aspects of football and tailgating from fellowship, food and even how we were naming the drinks,\u201d Pankey said. \u201cWhen we were giving away gifts to fans. ... We had to do jerseys. I wanted this to be a fan experience that was out of mind.\u201d",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "At Amazon Music, collaboration has fueled success with departments joining forces to lock in the hottest talent of the week.",
      "But predicting a year out? That's a tough play when album releases are anyone's guess. They use their label connections and instincts to keep them ahead of the game and ready to pivot and lockdown the artist with the next big release.",
      "\u201cWe try to really be as genre agnostic and diverse as possible,\u201d said Kirdis Postelle, global head of content and artist marketing at Amazon Music. She works with Andrew Sexton, who handles booking for \u201cAML.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur team, along with myself, are active in conversations about this program,\u201d said Sexton, who is considered a label relations guru. Some of the selling points to attract artists have been to capitalize off the NFL's huge viewership, promote their project and perform with top-notch production.",
      "\u201cWe're very active,\" he said. \"We're always in communications with artist's teams and people are reaching out to us too. ... We're in constant conversations with the industry.\"",
      "Following a high-stakes \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d matchup is plenty of pressure. But pulling off a live major concert after a big NFL showdown? That\u2019s next-level intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge which is fungible start time,\u201d said Ed Walker, the head of video studios at Amazon Music. He played an integral role in the concert series moving from a shared studio lot in Hollywood to now filming at East End Studios \u2014 a complex with more than 96,000-square-feet of space, including two soundstages, a rooftop terrace, green rooms and three stories of office space.",
      "After the game wraps, there\u2019s an hour preshow on Twitch and a top-of-show segment that takes audiences into the artist\u2019s world. The hope is to create a \u201ccloser connection\u201d before their performance, introducing more insight into the artist\u2019s project. There are sweepstakes and competitions to maintain intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe immerse them into what they are about to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a moving target. You have a very large audience watching football, and then we have direct communications to the control room broadcasting that and they are giving us real time updates.\u201d",
      "Walker admits it\u2019s a tough balancing act, keeping the football audience engaged while also entertaining \u201cAML\u201d viewers before the show kicks off.",
      "\u201cWe got to meet in the middle, entertain them all, give them context and start the show,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile all that\u2019s happening, we have to make sure the artist is on the stage and hits the cue on time.\u201d",
      "While artists are rehearsing, Postelle wants to make sure they\u2019re comfortable and don't leave. That led to the idea of an artist experience with food, games, drinks and privacy.",
      "\u201cWe do that to make artists feel good about spending so much time here,\u201d Postelle said. \u201cThe last thing you want is for somebody to be like \u2018I\u2019m going back to the hotel to take a shower\u2019 and they fall asleep. Then we\u2019ll have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Each week, select customers in the Los Angeles area are invited to purchase $15 tickets for that week's performance during an exclusive superfan presale or general onsale. Live events company DICE tracks upcoming events and uses audience targeting based on fan interests to notify potential attendees."

    "story": [
      "Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam.",
      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",
      "Online predators began approaching the teenager before his 16th birthday and his father believes such a ban could have saved his life.",
      "Australia's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted for such a ban and the Senate is expected to make it law soon.",
      "Holdsworth said most of the 3,000 students he\u2019s spoken to, from age 12 to 17, agree with a ban on children under the age of 16.",
      "\u201cThey come up to me and they say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that this is going to be implemented,\u2019\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cEven the kids see it now that they\u2019re going to be protected from those predators outside that are preying on them.\u201d",
      "He said three girls approached him after a school address on Monday to tell him that they were being subjected to sextortion. One had already handed over 2,500 Australian dollars ($1,600) of her parents\u2019 money to a blackmailer.",
      "Holdsworth said he was the first adult they had confided in.",
      "\u201cThe parent won\u2019t know until the credit card statement comes out,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s prevalent. It happened last night and it\u2019ll happen tonight,\u201d he added.",
      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",
      "\u201cI like it mainly because I think many of the social media platforms as they exist right now are not suitable environments for young children,\u201d she said."

      "Scientists are using used fossilized feces and vomit from Poland to reconstruct how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth",
      "NEW YORK -- Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago.",
      "Researchers aren't sure whether dinosaurs' rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: \u201cIt was not a sudden thing,\u201d said study co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m from Uppsala University.",
      "The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.",
      "The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said, eating whatever they could \u2014 including insects, fish and plants.",
      "When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species.",
      "Since the study\u2019s findings were limited to Polish fossils, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said he\u2019d like to see if their ideas hold steady against fossil records from around the world.",
      "It's not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. But fossilized feces can resemble blobs or chunks of rock, and they are not always found near fossils of the animal that made them \u2014 which makes it hard for scientists to know where they came from.",
      "In this study, researchers found fish scales, insect bits and bone shards nestled within the droppings.",
      "\u201cThey are a really unassuming, quite plain part of the background,\u201d said Dunne, who was not involved with the new research. \u201cBut they hold so much delicate, fine information.\u201d",

      "The federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized safeguards for artificial intelligence to one more focused on eliminating red tape",
      "WASHINGTON -- With artificial intelligence at a pivotal moment of development, the federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized AI safeguards to one more focused on eliminating red tape.",
      "That\u2019s a promising prospect for some investors but creates uncertainty about the future of any guardrails on the technology, especially around the use of AI deepfakes in elections and political campaigns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but the platform of the Republican National Committee, which he recently reshaped, said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an open question whether Congress, soon to be fully controlled by Republicans, will be interested in passing any AI-related legislation. Interviews with a dozen lawmakers and industry experts reveal there is still interest in boosting the technology\u2019s use in national security and cracking down on non-consensual explicit images.",
      "Yet the use of AI in elections and in spreading misinformation is likely to take a backseat as GOP lawmakers turn away from anything they view as potentially suppressing innovation or free speech.",
      "\u201cAI has incredible potential to enhance human productivity and positively benefit our economy,\u201d said Rep. Jay Obernolte, a California Republican widely seen as a leader in the evolving technology. \u201cWe need to strike an appropriate balance between putting in place the framework to prevent the harmful things from happening while at the same time enabling innovation.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence interests have been expecting sweeping federal legislation for years. But Congress, gridlocked on nearly every issue, failed to pass any artificial intelligence bill, instead producing only a series of proposals and reports.",
      "Some lawmakers believe there is enough bipartisan interest around some AI-related issues to get a bill passed.",
      "\u201cI find there are Republicans that are very interested in this topic,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, singling out national security as one area of potential agreement. \"I am confident I will be able to work with them as I have in the past.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how much Republicans want the federal government to intervene in AI development. Few showed interest before this year's election in regulating how the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission handled AI-generated content, worrying that it would raise First Amendment issues at the same time that Trump\u2019s campaign and other Republicans were using the technology to create political memes.",
      "The FCC was in the middle of a lengthy process for developing AI-related regulations when Trump won the presidency. That work has since been halted under long-established rules covering a change in administrations.",
      "Trump has expressed both interest and skepticism in artificial intelligence.",
      "During a Fox Business interview earlier this year, he called the technology \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cso scary\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no real solution.\u201d But his campaign and supporters also embraced AI-generated images more than their Democratic opponents. They often used them in social media posts that weren\u2019t meant to mislead, but rather to further entrench Republican political views.",
      "Elon Musk, Trump's close adviser and a founder of several companies that rely on AI, also has shown a mix of concern and excitement about the technology, depending on how it is applied.",
      "Musk used X, the social media platform he owns, to promote AI-generated images and videos throughout the election. Operatives from Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on artificial intelligence, have publicly been pushing Trump to tap Musk as his top adviser on the technology.",
      "\u201cWe think that Elon has a pretty sophisticated understating of both the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems,\u201d said Doug Calidas, a top operative from the group.",
      "But Musk advising Trump on artificial intelligence worries others. Peters argued it could undercut the president.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said the Michigan Democrat. \u201cWhenever you have anybody that has a strong financial interest in a particular technology, you should take their advice and counsel with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the election, many AI experts expressed concern about an eleventh-hour deepfake \u2014 a lifelike AI image, video or audio clip \u2014 that would sway or confuse voters as they headed to the polls. While those fears were never realized, AI still played a role in the election, said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, part of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute think tank.",
      "\u201cI would not use the term that I hear a lot of people using, which is it was the dog that didn\u2019t bark,\u201d she said of AI in the 2024 election. \u201cIt was there, just not in the way that we expected.\u201d",
      "Campaigns used AI in algorithms to target messages to voters. AI-generated memes, though not lifelike enough to be mistaken as real, felt true enough to deepen partisan divisions.",
      "A political consultant mimicked Joe Biden\u2019s voice in robocalls that could have dissuaded voters from coming to the polls during New Hampshire's primary if they hadn\u2019t been caught quickly. And foreign actors used AI tools to create and automate fake online profiles and websites that spread disinformation to a U.S. audience.",
      "Even if AI didn\u2019t ultimately influence the election outcome, the technology made political inroads and contributed to an environment where U.S. voters don\u2019t feel confident that what they are seeing is true. That dynamic is part of the reason some in the AI industry want to see regulations that establish guidelines.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and people on his team have said they don\u2019t want to stifle the technology and they do want to support its development, so that is welcome news,\u201d said Craig Albright, the top lobbyist and senior vice president at The Software Alliance, a trade group whose members include OpenAI, Oracle and IBM. \u201cIt is our view that passing national laws to set the rules of the road will be good for developing markets for the technology.\"",
      "AI safety advocates during a recent meeting in San Francisco made similar arguments, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University.",
      "\u201cBy putting literal guardrails, lanes, road rules, we were able to get cars that could roll a lot faster,\u201d said Venkatasubramanian, a former Biden administration official who helped craft White House principles for approaching AI.",
      "Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said he's not hopeful about the prospects for federal legislation and is concerned about Trump\u2019s pledge to rescind Biden\u2019s executive order, which created an initial set of national standards for the industry. His group has advocated for federal regulation of generative AI in elections.",
      "\u201cThe safeguards are themselves ways to promote innovation so that we have AI that\u2019s useful and safe and doesn\u2019t exclude people and promotes the technology in ways that serve the public interest,\u201d he said.",

The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company's perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "\u201cMark, obviously, he has his own interest, and he has his own company and he has his own agenda,\u201d Miller said in an interview on Fox News about the meeting. \u201cBut he\u2019s made clear that he wants to support the national renewal of America under Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Meta confirmed that Zuckerberg and Trump met on Wednesday, saying he was invited for dinner with the president-elect and other members of his team to talk about the incoming administration.",

      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president.",
      "Zuckerberg has since taken a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt, calling it \u201cbadass.\u201d Zuckerberg also complained that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to \u201ccensor\u201d some COVID-19 content during the pandemic.",

      "Whether it's Windows, macOS, iOS or Android, simply keeping your operating system and apps up-to-date will help protect your family's computers and devices against a surprising number of security threats, such as malware, viruses and exploits.",
      "Most operating systems, especially those for mobile devices and their app stores, typically have auto-updates turned on by default. Be sure to double-check the device to make sure it has enough storage space to carry out the update. (More on this below.)",

      "\u2014 Use the cloud to back up media: iPhone users can free up space occupied by songs and pictures by storing them on iCloud. Android users can use the Google Photos app to back up and store their photos on their user space.",

And if you want to impress a more tech-savvy cousin or auntie, you could suggest switching to a more secure digital authentication method: passkeys.",

      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",

      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market. A technology called DoubleClick is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while Google Ads maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined it constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation.",
      "In Monday's arguments, Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum cited the search engine case when he highlighted an email from a Google executive, David Rosenblatt, who said in a 2009 email that Google\u2019s goal was to \u201cdo to display what Google did to search,\" which Teitelbaum said showed the company's intent to achieve market dominance.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Biden administration plans on reducing part of Intel's $8.5 billion in federal funding for computer chip plants around the country, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The reduction is largely a byproduct of the $3 billion that Intel is also receiving to provide computer chips to the military. President Joe Biden announced the agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans in March.",
      "The changes to Intel\u2019s funding are not related to the company\u2019s financial record or milestones, the people familiar with the grant told The Associated Press. In August, the chipmaker announced that it would cut 15% of its workforce \u2014 about 15,000 jobs \u2014 in an attempt to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD.",
      "Unlike some of its rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them.",
      "Two years ago, President Biden hailed Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised the company for plans to \u201cbuild a workforce of the future\u201d for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year.",
      "The California-based tech giant's funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Biden has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation.",
      "The Biden administration helped shepherd the legislation following pandemic-era concerns that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession. When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.",
      "In August, the administration pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant could expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time. The Commerce Department said the funding for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. meant the company could expand on its existing plans for two facilities in Phoenix and add a third, newly announced production hub.",

      "Usually a prolific X user, the 50-year-old internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6. His New Zealand-based lawyer, Ron Mansfield, told the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday that Dotcom suffered the stroke on Nov. 7 and is expected to remain hospitalized for some time. His prognosis is uncertain, Mansfield said.",
      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer."

      "Australia\u2019s House of Representatives has passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years from social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media, leaving it to the Senate to finalize the world-first law.",
      "The major parties backed the bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "The legislation passed 102 to 13. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "\u201cWill it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it\u2019s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d Tehan told Parliament.",
      "The bill was introduced to the Senate late Wednesday but it adjourned for the day hours later without putting it to a vote. The legislation will likely be passed on Thursday, the Parliament's final session for the year and potentially the last before elections, which are due within months.",
      "The major parties\u2019 support all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.",
      "Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms encountered, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would \u201cmake zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,\u201d Daniel told Parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that\u2019s because no other country wants to do it,\u201d she added.",
      "The platforms had asked for the vote to be delayed until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how the ban could be enforced.",
      "Melbourne resident Wayne Holdsworth, whose 17-year-old son Mac took his own life last year after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, described the bill as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the only thing that we need to do to protect them because education is the key, but to provide some immediate support for our children and parents to be able to manage this, it\u2019s a great step,\u201d the 65-year-old online safety campaigner told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cAnd in my opinion, it\u2019s the greatest time in our country\u2019s history,\u201d he added, referring to the pending legal reform."

      "The Massachusetts-based tech company, whose scanners have also been used at sports stadiums and schools, has faced allegations of misconduct. Last month, Evolv\u2019s board of directors fired its chief executive following an internal investigation that found certain sales had been \u201csubject to extra-contractual terms and conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, the company announced it had resolved a previous probe launched by the Federal Trade Commission last year over allegations of deceptive marketing practices. The company is also under separate investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Despite the legal and regulatory scrutiny, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced a pilot program this summer to bring a handful of scanners to the city's subways to deter gun violence. The initiative drew immediate criticism from civil liberties groups who said the searches were unconstitutional, along with questions about its efficacy.",
      "In October, the city revealed the scanners did not detect any passengers with firearms \u2014 but falsely alerted more than 100 times.",
      "At the time, a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said it was still \u201cevaluating the outcome of the pilot\u201d and had not entered into any contract with Evolv."

      "Drake alleged in a court filing Monday that Universal Music Group falsely pumped up the popularity on Spotify and other streaming services of Kendrick Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us,\" a song that viciously attacked Drake amid a bitter feud between the two hip-hop superstars.",
      "The petition in a New York court by the rapper's company Frozen Moments LLC demands the preservation and divulgence of information that might be evidence in a potential lawsuit against UMG, which is the distributor for the record labels of both Drake and Lamar.",
      "In allegations that UMG calls \u201coffensive and untrue,\u201d the filing says the record company \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 in order to make that song go viral, including by using \u2018bots\u2019 and pay-to-play agreements.\u201d It said the company and Spotify \u201chave a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship\u201d and alleges that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:42:35 -0500",
    "summary": "President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
      "ATLANTA -- President Joe Biden's administration announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy will make a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian Automotive to build a factory in Georgia that had stalled as the startup electric vehicle maker struggled to become profitable.",
      "It's unclear whether the administration can complete the loan before Donald Trump becomes president again in less than two months, or whether the Trump administration might try to claw the money back.",
      "Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles and $4,000 for used ones.",
      "Rivian made a splash when it went public and began producing large electric R1 SUVs, pickup trucks and delivery vans at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, in 2021. Months later, the California-based company announced it would build a second, larger, $5 billion plant about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Atlanta, near the town of Social Circle.",
      "The R1 vehicles cost $70,000 or more. The company plans to produce R2 vehicles, a smaller SUV, in Georgia with lower price tags aimed at a mass market. The first phase of Rivian\u2019s Georgia factory is projected to make 200,000 vehicles a year, with a second phase capable of another 200,000 a year. Eventually, the plant is projected to employ 7,500 workers.",
      "But Rivian was unable to meet production and sales targets and rapidly burned through cash. In March, the company said it would pause construction of the Georgia plant. The company said it would begin assembling its R2 SUV in Illinois instead.",
      "CEO RJ Scaringe said the move would allow Rivian to start selling the R2 sooner and save $2.25 billion in capital spending. Since then, German automaker Volkswagen AG said in June it would invest $5 billion in Rivian in a joint venture in which Rivian would share software and electrical technology with Volkswagen. The money eased Rivian's cash crunch.",
      "Tuesday's announcement throws a lifeline to Rivian's grander plans. The company said its plans to make the R2 and the smaller R3 in Georgia are back on and that production will begin in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,\u201d Scaringe said in a statement.",
      "The Energy Department said the loan would substantially boost electric vehicles made in the United States and support Biden\u2019s goal of having zero-emission vehicles make up half of all new U.S. sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cAs one of a few American EV startups with light duty vehicles already on the road, Rivian\u2019s Georgia facility will allow the company to reach production volumes that make its products more cost competitive and accelerate access to international markets,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "The loan includes $6 billion, plus $600 million in interest that will be rolled into the principal. The money would come from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to make fuel-efficient vehicles and components. The program has focused mostly on loans to new battery factories for electric vehicles under Biden, but earlier helped finance initial production of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, two pioneering electric vehicles.",
      "The loan program, created in 2007, requires a \"reasonable prospect of repayment\" of the loan. Under Biden, the program has announced deals totaling $33.3 billion, including $9.2 billion for massive battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky for Ford\u2019s electric vehicles.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who has been a vocal supporter of electric vehicle and solar manufacturing in Georgia, hailed Tuesday's announcement as \u201cyet another historic federal investment in Georgia electric vehicle manufacturing.\u201d Ossoff had asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to support the loan in July.",
      "\u201cOur federal manufacturing incentives are driving economic development across the state of Georgia,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp says his goal is to make Georgia a center of the electric vehicle industry. But the Republican has had a strained relationship with the Biden administration over its industrial policy, even as some studies have found Georgia has netted more electric vehicle investment than any other state.",
      "Kemp has long claimed that manufacturers were picking Georgia before Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, was passed.",
      "Efforts to bring Rivian to Georgia predated the Biden administration and \"our shared vision to bring opportunity to Georgia will remain no matter who resides in the White House or what party controls Congress,\u201d Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said Tuesday.",
      "The loan to Rivian could rescue one of the Kemp administration's signature economic development projects even as Biden leaves office. That could put Rivian and Kemp in the position of defending the loan if Trump tries to quash it.",
      "State and local governments offered Rivian an incentive package worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 2022. Neighbors opposed to development of the Georgia site mounted legal challenges.",
      "State and local governments spent around $125 million to buy and prepare the nearly 2,000-acre (810-hectare) site. The state also has completed most of $50 million in roadwork that it pledged.",
      "The pause at Rivian contrasts with rapid construction at Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex near Savannah. The Korean automaker said in October that it had begun production in Ellabell, where it plans to eventually employ 8,500.",

      "Serengeti\u2019s results were a \u201cdrastic increase\u201d compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol\u2019s Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press.",
      "Interpol\u2019s previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years.",
      "\u201cSignificant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,\u201d Gonzalez said.",
      "In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme.",
      "Chelba said Afripol\u2019s focus now includes emerging threats like Artificial Intelligence-driven malware and advanced cyberattack techniques.",
      "Other dismantled networks included a group in Cameroon suspected of using a multi-level marketing scam for human trafficking, an international criminal group in Angola running an illegal virtual casino and a cryptocurrency investment scam in Nigeria, the agency said.",
      "Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest \u2014 if not best-funded \u2014 police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries.",
      "Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union\u2019s police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States."

      "Retired oil executive Charles Romer, 73, and his wife Catherine, 75, vanished with their 1978 Lincoln in the spring of 1980. The Scarsdale, New York, couple were returning home from Miami Beach, Florida, and checked into a Holiday Inn in Brunswick, Georgia.

      "\u201cAt this time there is no conclusion about the identity of the remains that were found,\u201d police said in a statement.",
      "The statement did not speculate on what might have happened to the Romers, but at the time of their disappearance, law officers expressed concerns about foul play. Catherine Romer was wearing about $81,000 worth of jewelry at the time, and police said one theory was that thieves burglarized their motel room, The Associated Press reported previously.",
      "\u201cWe all felt with our experience that these people had been kidnapped and killed for her jewelry, and the vehicle and the bodies were hidden in the water,\u201d rescue diver George Baker, who searched for the car over the years, told the AP in 1998."

      "Bush and Rylie DuBois, a sophomore biosystems engineering major and undergraduate research assistant at the lab, set out to produce earhole inserts made from polylactic acid, a bio-based plastic, using a 3D printer. Part of the challenge was accounting for the earhole sizes and shapes that vary depending on helmet style.",
      "Once the season got underway with a Friday night home game against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30, the helmets of starting quarterback Aidan Chiles and linebacker Jordan Turner were outfitted with the inserts, which helped mitigate crowd noise.",
      "DuBois attended the game, sitting in the student section.",
      "\u201cI felt such a strong sense of accomplishment and pride,\u201d DuBois said. \u201cAnd I told all my friends around me about how I designed what they were wearing on the field.\u201d",
      "All told, Bush and DuBois have produced around 180 sets of the inserts, a number that grew in part due to the variety of helmet designs and colors that are available to be worn by Spartan players any given Saturday. Plus, the engineering folks have been fine-tuning their design throughout the season.",
      "Dozens of Bowl Subdivision programs are doing something similar. In many cases, they\u2019re getting 3D-printed earhole covers from XO Armor Technologies, which provides on-site, on-demand 3D printing of athletic wearables.",
      "The Auburn, Alabama-based company has donated its version of the earhole covers to the equipment managers of programs ranging from Georgia and Clemson to Boise State and Arizona State in the hope the schools would consider doing business with XO Armor in the future, said Jeff Klosterman, vice president of business development.",
      "XO Armor first was approached by the Houston Texans at the end of last season about creating something to assist quarterback C.J. Stroud in better hearing play calls delivered to his helmet during road games. XO Armor worked on a solution and had completed one when it received another inquiry: Ohio State, which had heard Michigan State was moving forward with helmet inserts, wondered if XO Armor had anything in the works.",
      "\u201cWe kind of just did this as a one-off favor to the Texans and honestly didn\u2019t forecast it becoming our viral moment in college football,\u201d Klosterman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got about 60 teams across college football and the NFL wearing our sound-deadening earhole covers every weekend.\u201d",
      "The rules state that only one player for each team is permitted to be in communication with coaches while on the field. For the Spartans, it\u2019s typically Chiles on offense and Turner on defense. Turner prefers to have an insert in both earholes, but Chiles has asked that the insert be used in only one on his helmet.",
      "Chiles \u201clikes to be able to feel like he has some sort of outward exposure,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "Exposure is something the sophomore signal-caller from Long Beach, California, had in away games against Michigan and Oregon this season. Michigan Stadium welcomed 110,000-plus fans for the Oct. 26 matchup between the in-state rivals. And while just under 60,000 packed Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, for the Ducks' 31-10 win over Michigan State three weeks earlier, it was plenty loud. \u201cThe Big Ten has some pretty impressive venues,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "\u201cIt can be just deafening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what those fans are there for is to create havoc and make it difficult for coaches to get a play call off.\u201d",
      "Something that is a bit easier to handle thanks to Bush and her team. She called the inserts a \u201cwin-win-win\" for everyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to work with athletics and the football team,\" she said. \"I think it\u2019s really exciting for our students as well to take what they\u2019ve learned and develop and design something and see it being used and executed.\u201d",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
      "A bankruptcy judge on Monday delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars, keeping the auction sale up in the air for at least another few weeks.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction that resulted in The Onion being named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with him. A trustee overseeing the auction denies the allegations and accuses Jones of launching a smear campaign because he didn't like the outcome.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez had been scheduled to hear an emergency motion to disqualify The Onion's bid on Monday, but put it off until either Dec. 9 or Dec. 17. That's also when the judge will hear arguments on the trustee's request to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion. Lopez said it made sense to have one hearing on both requests.",
      "\u201cI want a fair and transparent process and let\u2019s just see where the process goes,\" Lopez said.",
      "Lopez could ultimately allow The Onion to move forward with its purchase, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Jones continues to broadcast his show from the Infowars studio, but he has set up a new location, websites and social media accounts as a precaution. The trustee shut down the Austin studio and Infowars' websites for about 24 hours last week after The Onion was announced as the winning bidder, but allowed them to resume the next day, drawing more complaints from Jones.",
      "Jones declared bankruptcy and liquidated his assets after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. He was ordered to pay damages for defamation and emotional distress in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas after he repeatedly said the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones\u2019 creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Last year, Lopez ruled that $1.1 billion of the Sandy Hook judgments could not be discharged in the bankruptcy. On Monday, he denied a request from Sandy Hook families to make the full $1.5 billion not dischargeable, meaning the debt cannot be wiped clean.",
      "Also Monday, lawyers for the social media platform X objected to any sale of the accounts of both Jones and Infowars, saying X is the owner of the accounts and it has not given consent for them to be sold or transferred. Jones' personal X account, with 3.3 million followers, was not part of the auction, but Lopez will be deciding if it should be included in the liquidation.",
      "Jones has praised X owner Elon Musk on his show and suggested that Musk should buy Infowars. Musk has not responded publicly to that suggestion and was not among the bidders.",
      "Jones was permanently banned from Twitter in 2018 for abusive behavior, but Musk restored Jones\u2019 account on the platform he has since renamed X in December last year.",
      "Jones alleges The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of the Sandy Hook families, the humor site and the court-appointed trustee.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected from among the two sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account. He filed a counter lawsuit last week against Murray, The Onion's parent company and the Sandy Hook families in the bankruptcy court.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, Murray called the allegations a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to delay the sale of Infowars to The Onion and accused Jones, his lawyers and attorneys for First United American Companies of a \u201cvicious smear campaign lobbing patently false accusations.\u201d He also alleged Jones collaborated with First United American Companies to try to buy Infowars.",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts. Another auction of remaining assets is set for Dec. 10.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate, guns and other belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court this year say Jones had about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technolog...",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technology that the Biden administration already uses to help make crucial decisions in tracking, detaining and ultimately deporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status.",
      "While immigration officials have used the tech for years, an October letter from the Department of Homeland Security obtained exclusively by The Associated Press details how those tools \u2014 some of them powered by AI \u2014 help make decisions over whether an immigrant should be detained or surveilled.",
      "One algorithm, for example, ranks immigrants with a \u201cHurricane Score,\u201d ranging from 1-5, to assess whether someone will \u201cabscond\u201d from the agency's supervision.",
      "The letter, sent by DHS Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen to the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law, revealed that the score calculates the potential risk that an immigrant \u2014 with a pending case \u2014 will fail to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The algorithm relies on several factors, he said, including an immigrant\u2019s number of violations and length of time in the program, and whether the person has a travel document. Hysen wrote that ICE officers consider the score, among other information, when making decisions about an immigrant\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cThe Hurricane Score does not make decisions on detention, deportation, or surveillance; instead, it is used to inform human decision-making,\u201d Hysen wrote.",
      "Also included in the government\u2019s tool kit is a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial matching and can track an immigrant\u2019s specific location.",
      "Nearly 200,000 people without legal status who are in removal proceedings are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention program, under which certain immigrants can live in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "In exchange, SmartLINK and GPS trackers used by ICE rigorously surveil them and their movements. The phone application draws on facial matching technology and geolocation data, which has been used before to find and arrest those using the app.",
      "Just Futures Law wrote to Hysen earlier this year, questioning the fairness of using an algorithm to assess whether someone is a flight risk and raising concerns over how much data SmartLINK collects. Such AI systems, which score or screen people, are used widely but remain largely unregulated even though some have been found to discriminate on race, gender or other protected traits.",
      "DHS said in an email that it is committed to ensuring that its use of AI is transparent and safeguards privacy and civil rights while avoiding biases. The agency said it is working to implement the Biden administration\u2019s requirements on using AI, but Hysen said in his letter that security officials may waive those requirements for certain uses. Trump has publicly vowed to repeal Biden's AI policy when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cDHS uses AI to assist our personnel in their work, but DHS does not use the outputs of AI systems as the sole basis for any law enforcement action or denial of benefits,\u201d a spokesperson for DHS told the AP.",
      "Trump has not revealed how he plans to carry out his promised deportation of an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Although he has proposed invoking wartime powers, as well as military involvement, the plan would face major logistical challenges \u2014 such as where to keep those who have been detained and how to find people spread across the country \u2014 that AI-powered surveillance tools could potentially address.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer questions about how the incoming administration plans to use DHS\u2019 tech, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation\u201d in American history.",
      "Over 100 civil society groups sent a letter on Friday urging the Office of Management and Budget to require DHS to comply with the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines. A spokesperson for OMB said that agencies must align their AI tools with the guidelines by December 1, and that any extensions or waivers of that deadline will be publicly disclosed next month.",
      "Just Futures Law\u2019s executive director, Paromita Shah, said if immigrants are scored as flight risks, they are more likely to remain in detention, \"limiting their ability to prepare a defense in their case in immigration court, which is already difficult enough as it is.\u201d",
      "SmartLINK, part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison company The GEO Group. The GEO Group also contracts with ICE to run detention centers.",
      "ICE is tight-lipped about how it uses SmartLINK\u2019s location feature to find and arrest immigrants. Still, public records show that during Trump\u2019s first term in 2018, Manassas, Virginia-based employees of BI Inc. relayed immigrants\u2019 GPS locations to federal authorities, who then arrested over 40 people.",
      "In a report last year to address privacy issues and concerns, DHS said that the mobile app includes security features that \u201cprohibit access to information on the participant\u2019s mobile device, with the exception of location data points when the app is open.\u201d",
      "But the report notes that there remains a risk that data collected from people \"may be misused for unauthorized persistent monitoring.\u201d",
      "Such information could also be stored in other ICE and DHS databases and used for other DHS mission purposes, the report said.",
      "On investor calls earlier this month, private prison companies were clear-eyed about the opportunities ahead.",
      "The GEO Group\u2019s executive chairman George Christopher Zoley said that he expects the incoming Trump administration to \u201ctake a much more aggressive approach regarding border security as well as interior enforcement and to request additional funding from Congress to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn GEO\u2019s ISAP program, we can scale up from the present 182,500 participants to several hundreds of thousands, or even millions of participants,\u201d Zoley said.",
      "That same day, the head of another private prison company told investors he would be watching closely to see how the new administration may change immigrant monitoring programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for multiple vendors to engage ICE about the program going forward and think about creative and innovative solutions to not only get better outcomes, but also scale up the program as necessary,\u201d Damon Hininger, CEO of the private prison company CoreCivic Inc. said on an earnings call.",
      "GEO did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, CoreCivic said that it has played \u201ca valued but limited role in America\u2019s immigration system\u201d for both Democrats and Republicans for over 40 years."

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched around 100 drones and more than 90 missiles into Ukraine, including projectiles carrying cluster munitions. \"Each such attack proves that air defense systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not in storage bases,\" he added.",
      "\"This is especially important in the winter, when we have to protect our infrastructure from targeted Russian strikes,\" Zelenskyy said.",

      "The air force said it recorded 12 impacts, \"mainly at fuel and energy sector facilities.\" The force also said Russia is changing its weapons and tactics making it harder to intercept projectiles, for example by \"shooting thermal and radar traps and also using electronic warfare personal protection means installed directly on missiles.\"",
      "These measures, plus the large number of drones and missiles fired together, \"significantly complicates the work of Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile systems,\" it added. Western platforms, the air force said, are more effective, but there \"are not enough in Ukraine to reliably cover hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities.\"",
      "Weather conditions also played a role, the air force noted. \"Dense fog and cloudiness\" can make it difficult for ground crews and fighter pilots to intercept incoming missiles and drones, it wrote.",

      "The state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo, Galushchenko added, moved onto emergency power outage schedules due to the attacks. Ukrenergo said on Telegram that the attack was the eleventh combined missile and drone attack on energy infrastructure in 2024 to date.",

    "title": "How far does presidential immunity go? Questions after Trump cases dropped: ANALYSIS",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:46:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling on executive power is now left untested.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in July handed down what one justice called a \"rule for the ages\" on presidential immunity.",
      "But the dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
      "Smith's criminal prosecution was set to be the first major test of the court's blockbuster decision, in which the conservative majority held former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for \"core\" constitutional functions and presumptive immunity for \"official\" acts but no immunity for \"unofficial\" acts.",
      "What constituted an official or unofficial act raised \"difficult questions\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, and was largely left to lower courts to parse out answers through hearings and appeals about specific facts and actions.",
      "Could Trump be held liable for alleged pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally reject the 2020 election outcome? What about his false statements to the public about voter fraud?",
      "That's impossible to say for now as Smith moved to have the case dropped in the wake of Trump's 2024 win, citing long-standing Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of a sitting president. He also dropped the classified documents case against Trump.",
      "\"This uncertainty over the scope of presidential immunity raises the specter for both Trump and any future president that they truly are above criminal law,\" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University in Minnesota.",
      "Trump is already entering office with fewer potential checks than in his first term. Both the House and the Senate will be controlled by Republicans, making congressional oversight and impeachment two tools unlikely to be used should he be accused of crossing a traditional boundary.",
      "He will also not be subject to electoral accountability, given that this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The possibility of criminal prosecution would normally be another check, but experts aren't so sure after the Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina, said the immunity ruling \"will undoubtedly ensure that there will be very few, quite limited guardrails against any abuse of power.\"",
      "\"To the extent that one is concerned about that emboldening him to take action without regard to consequences of criminal prosecution, that's a real concern,\" said Jessica Roth, a professor at Cardozo School of Law and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "The Supreme Court's liberal justices raised similar fears in their dissents, but Chief Justice Roberts pushed back that the majority opinion \"does not place him above the law.\"",
      "\"Like everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity,\" he wrote. \"But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan tossed the federal election subversion case without prejudice, meaning, in theory, the charges could be filed again when Trump leaves office. Though experts noted such a scenario is highly improbable and could run up against statute of limitations or other problems.",
      "Some immunity questions could still play out in the state cases against Trump in New York and Georgia -- but those have also stalled in recent weeks.",
      "Trump was convicted by a jury on 34 felony charges in connection to a hush money payments made just before the 2016 election. Now, he's seeking to have the case dismissed based on the U.S. Supreme Court's immunity ruling. The judge has indefinitely postponed sentencing for Trump until the issue is sorted.",
      "\"That's the place where we'd see the Supreme Court decision tested most immediately,\" said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment trial.",
      "Still, Eisen said \"we will not get all the answers in the state case because it's a pretty tangential immunity claim.\"",
      "Eisen noted ongoing prosecutions against other figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election could keep at least some of Trump's past behavior in the spotlight.",
      "\"[Trump] may be immune, he may be in office, but all over the country cases have been brought against the false electors,\" Eisen said. \"And those cases will proceed to trial and illuminate Trump's involvement even though he's not a defendant in those cases. That's another place where certainly there's going to be a form of public narrative about what happened, his role in it and whether he should be held accountable.\"",

    "summary": "According to a lawsuit filed by No Labels, Democratic operatives attempted to sabotage it attempts to run a third-party presidential candidate, according to a lawsuit.",
    "story": [
      "Lawsuit says Democrats tried to scare away donors and potential candidates.",
      "As the bipartisan group No Labels attempted to field a third-party independent bid in the 2024 presidential race, several of its opponents aggressively attempted to sabotage its operations in hopes of preventing the group from moving forward, according to a lawsuit the group has filed.",
      "A lawsuit filed initially against NoLabels.com Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware in December of 2023 alleges that some in the Democratic Party undertook deliberate efforts to undermine the group, ultimately forcing it to halt operations. No Labels is now seeking to recover monetary damages as a result.",
      "NoLabels.com Inc., which was created to mimic the real No Labels website \u2013 NoLabels.org, is believed to be incorporated in Delaware, according to the suit.",
      "Documents unsealed in the case allegedly show how a handful of Democratic strategists operating under the fake NoLabels.com banner attempted to use fear tactics to raise uncertainty among No Labels supporters and donors, drive skepticism in the media, and question the authenticity and scope of the centrist group. At one point, operatives even viciously targeted No Labels founder Nancy Jacobson, as well as candidates interested in serving on its \u201cUnity Ticket.\u201d",
      "One document included a business deck orchestrated by a group of political operatives called the American Patriots Project (APP) to imitate No Labels' website with the purchase of the NoLabels.com domain as well as Google search ads. According to the deck, the operatives attempted to mislead voters and paint the centrist group as Christo-nationalists and featured images of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking on behalf of the group. The saboteurs' goal was to imply that No Labels was a right-wing shadow effort. Furthermore, the proposal attempted to falsely fixate on \u201cred meat issues\u201d such as immigration and anti-abortion messaging.",
      "U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware Judge Gregory B. Williams issued a court order for the operatives to take down the NoLabels.com website; however, No Labels believes that there were more attempts to disavow their operations.",
      "No Labels subpoenaed APP on Nov. 5 seeking to uncover more information.",
      "Democratic strategists with ties to American Bridge -- which calls itself the largest research, video tracking, and rapid response organization affiliated with the Democratic Party -- also attempted to single out donors, according to a three-step proposal in one email listed in court documents. As donors engaged in conversation, strategists would suggest that their money was being mismanaged with inefficient or wasteful spending. These strategists also attempted to misinform the media about No Labels' goals.",
      "ABC News has reached out for comment to American Bridge but has not gotten a reply.",
      "Earlier this week, No Labels leaders updated supporters on a Zoom call.",
      "\u201cWe believe in democracy in this organization, and obviously some people didn't want us to live democracy out the way we were living it,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the group's national convention chairman, told the call before tossing to Dan Webb, a No Labels board member, who updated supporters on the legal findings.",
      "Webb notified supporters that they called on the Department of Justice to look into any potential illegal conduct.",
      "\u201cI think one of the defining stories will be that it's just wrong for a group of elite donors, party operatives, media mouthpieces to actually decide that the way, the way we should protect democracy is to make sure we have less of it,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Most of the No Labels \"family members\" on the call were infuriated with the allegations and pleaded for national exposure, suggesting outlets like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d or Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to spread awareness. Overall, the call was an opportunity for supporters to air their grievances.",
      "\u201cI agree wholeheartedly with publicizing this as much as possible, and not making it seem like it's just normal politics,\u201d one supporter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not acceptable; they've interfered with the democratic process here,\u201d another supporter added.",
      "Asked if the efforts were \u201cjust politics\u201d or \u201cdirty politics,\u201d No Labels leaders suggested it went beyond that.",
      "\u201cI'm a strong believer in the First Amendment, and political speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment, but the law is also clear that you cannot violate the law and claim that even though you violated the law, you were just engaging in politics,\u201d Webb said.",
      "He continued, \u201cI believe we did the right thing by reporting the information to the Department of Justice, and whatever the Department of Justice decides to do, they decide to do.\u201d",
      "One supporter suggested that the scandal sounded like Watergate and questioned whether it was worth pursuing lawsuits. Another supporter told No Labels leaders to focus on the Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress and dismiss the past.",
      "\u201cWe should focus on the fact that no candidate received a majority in this election,\u201d one supporter suggested. \u201cOur need is to focus on fixing Congress. So I think we need to balance this very carefully and not focus on a way that distracts from one main issue, and casts us as being associated with the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Back in April, the group halted its efforts when it was unable to find a candidate that had a credible path to winning with its bipartisan platform.",
      "No Labels intended to offer a different choice than the presumptive presidential nominees at that time -- incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump -- to citizens who yearned for something new instead of a repeat of the 2020 election. As they entered the race in March, they suggested their internal polling showed more than 70% of Americans said they'd be open to another option.",
      "The group intends to meet with supporters in Washington, D.C., in December to create a plan to deal with the new Congress and work with congressional leaders.",

      "\"Trump's rhetoric is completely different,\" one expert said.",
      "Tariff threats voiced by President-elect Donald Trump this week rippled through global stocks and triggered warnings from U.S. retail executives about the risk of higher prices.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, who congratulated Trump a day after the election, has not commented on Trump's remarks, in keeping with a low public profile. As recently as 2021, however, Bush criticized trade barriers, lamenting the GOP under Trump as \"isolationist, protectionist.\"",
      "Trump's support for tariffs and skepticism toward global trade departs from previous Republican presidents spanning the past four decades.",
      "Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and his father, George H.W. Bush, each venerated free trade, though in some cases they put forward policies similar to Trump's protectionist proposals.",
      "\"Trump is not talking about free trade,\" Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Reagan. \"Trump's rhetoric is completely different.\"",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the Trump transition team said his tariff plans would boost the U.S. economy.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted\u00a0tariffs\u00a0against China that created jobs, spurred investment, and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and unshackling American energy,\" Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Trump late Monday said he would charge Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all products coming into the United States until action is taken by those countries to stem illegal immigration and the overflow of drugs across the border.",
      "For China, Trump said that he'd impose an additional 10% tariff on products coming to the U.S.",
      "The declarations of trade hostility echoed vows made by Trump on the campaign trail.",
      "Speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago in October, Trump called \"tariff\" the \"most most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"",
      "Tariffs as high as 2,000%, would safeguard key U.S. industries, such as auto manufacturing, Trump said. In the absence of tariffs, Trump added, it's \"going to be the end of Michigan.\"",
      "The favorable tone toward protectionist policies contrasts with rhetoric voiced by Trump's Republican predecessors.",
      "Reagan, who served in the latter years of the Cold War in the 1980s, invoked free trade as a weapon in the fight against authoritarian adversaries abroad and perceived demagogues at home.",
      "\"Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies,\" then-President Ronald Reagan said in 1988, after signing a free trade agreement with Canada.",
      "\"We should beware of the demagogues who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends -- weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag,\" Reagan added.",
      "The elder Bush, who had served as Reagan's vice president, adopted a similar posture toward trade.",
      "As president, George H.W. Bush sought to improve trade ties with China, and he helped establish the World Trade Organization, an international body that aims to facilitate global trade through a shared set of regulations.",
      "In the early 1990s, Bush negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a trade pact between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Free trade throughout the Americas is an idea whose time has come,\" Bush said at a ceremony promoting NAFTA in December 1992.",
      "\"This century's epic struggle between totalitarianism and democracy is over. It's dead. Democracy has prevailed,\" he added. \"Today, we see unfolding around the world a revolution of hope and courage, propelled by the aspiration of ordinary people for freedom and a better life.\"",
      "The deal was ratified under Bush's successor, President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.",
      "During his first presidential campaign in 2016, Trump sharply criticized NAFTA, which had drawn criticism for allowing manufacturers to relocate plants abroad and lay off U.S. workers.",
      "Weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Trump described NAFTA as \"the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\"",
      "Like Reagan and his father, George W. Bush voiced support for free trade while in office. Since then, he has continued to back global commerce and oppose trade barriers.",
      "\"Since World War II, America has encouraged and benefited from the global advance of free markets, from the strength of democratic alliances, and from the advance of free societies,\" George W. Bush said in 2017.",
      "\"Free nations are less likely to threaten and fight each other. And free trade helped make America into a global economic power,\" George W. Bush added.",
      "Despite their rhetoric, Trump's predecessors within the Republican Party put forward some policies that resembled his proposals this week.",
      "Reagan slapped 45% tariffs on Japanese motorcycles, and 100% tariffs on some Japanese electronics, seeking to counter that nation's economic rise and bolster domestic industry. Reagan also placed an annual quota on the allowable number of imported Japanese cars.",
      "\"There was a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,\" Hanke, the former Reagan administration economist, told ABC News.",
      "For his part, George W. Bush attempted to protect the U.S. steel industry by placing tariffs on some steel imports. Facing pushback from the World Trade Organization and threats of retaliation from other countries, he removed the tariffs after 18 months."

      "A judge has upheld a Missouri law requiring voters to show photo identification to cast a regular ballot",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- A law requiring Missouri voters to show government-issued photo identification to cast regular ballots will stand after a lower-court judge found it constitutional Tuesday.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem's decision upholds the law, which was made possible by a 2016 voter-approved constitutional amendment allowing lawmakers to enact photo ID requirements.",
      "\u201cTo maintain a secure system for voting, it only stands to reason that a photo ID should be essential,\u201d Missouri Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said in a statement praising the ruling.",
      "Voter photo ID supporters such as Ashcroft say the practice prevents voter fraud and improves public confidence in election results. Voting rights advocates say getting the records needed to obtain proper photo identification can be challenging, especially for older voters and people with disabilities.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 21 ask for a photo ID.",
      "Under Missouri\u2019s law, people without government-issued photo identification can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures.",
      "The law also requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote.",
      "Missouri's NAACP and League of Women Voters, along with two individual voters, sued to overturn the law in 2022. They argued that some voters faced substantial obstacles getting up-to-date and accurate government-issued photo IDs and worried that casting a provisional ballot could put them at higher risk of having their votes not counted.",
      "Beetem initially dismissed the lawsuit, finding neither of the two individual voters \u201calleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement.\u201d",
      "The Missouri ACLU and Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, in response added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional.",
      "Beetem noted in his Tuesday ruling that all of the individual plaintiffs have successfully voted since the law took effect.",
      "\u201cTheir claim that their provisional ballots may be rejected is purely speculative,\u201d Beetem wrote. \u201cIn addition, the evidence at trial confirms that rejection rates for provisional ballots are low, and the rates specifically for signature-mismatch are exceedingly low.\u201d",
      "He concluded that the law's rules on photo identification \u201cprotect the fundamental right to vote by deterring difficult to detect forms of voter fraud.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they will appeal Beetem's ruling.",
      "\u201cThe League believes the state should be making it easier, not harder, for Missourians to exercise their fundamental right to vote,\" Missouri League of Women Voters President Marilyn McLeod said in a statement. \"There\u2019s no evidence of voter impersonation in Missouri, so these restrictions don\u2019t make our elections any safer or more secure.\u201d",

John Duarte in the inland 13th Congressional District in the San Joaquin Valley. In California's 45th Congressional District, anchored in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, Democrat Derek Tran has a roughly 600-vote lead over Republican Rep. Michelle Steel.",
      "In Iowa, GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is up by 800 votes in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, though a recount is unlikely to change the result in the competitive district. Miller-Meeks first won her seat in 2020 by six votes.",
      "If these results hold, the House will start with a 220-215 GOP majority, even thinner than the current Congress' margin.",
      "Republican ranks, however, drop to 219 with former Rep. Matt Gaetz's resignation. It could fall further to 217 depending on the timing of the resignations of Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who are set to join the Trump administration as U.S. ambassador to United Nations and national security adviser, respectively.",
      "That would send the chamber to a 217-215 margin -- giving Republicans no room for error, since any tied votes at 216-216 would fail.",

      "\"But I've told President Trump, enough already, give me some relief. I have to maintain this majority. And he understands that, of course, we've been talking about it almost hourly every day,\" he added.",
      "Already, Republicans have dealt with chaos in the current Congress.",
      "Bands of hardline members have grown just large enough to block votes on bills, moves that were once viewed as beyond the pale within the halls of Congress. And, unforgettably, Republican divisions left the House without a speaker for days, both at the beginning when Kevin McCarthy was looking to get the requisite support and again after he gave up the gavel and members were torn for days before coalescing behind Johnson.",
      "Heading into the current Congress, Republicans have sought to grease the skids a little bit more to try to avoid such public brawls from happening in the future.",
      "Republicans agreed to raise the number of lawmakers needed to trigger a vote to oust a speaker from one to nine. In return, lawmakers who oppose proposals to allow votes on bills will not face retaliation.",
      "But with such a narrow margin, any one Republican could and throw the floor into chaos and block the party-line passage of key bills.",
      "One of the largest legislative items up for business is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump pushed during his first term. They're set to expire next year, and Republicans have hoped to extend them -- but 12 House Republicans voted against the 2017 GOP tax law, which only passed thanks to a larger majority at the time.",
      "In 2017, when Republicans passed a rewrite of the tax code during the first Trump administration, 12 House Republicans -- part of a larger majority at the time -- voted against the bill, but did not prevent its passage.",
      "Republicans began the 118th Congress in 2023 with 222 seats -- a 10-seat margin over 212 Democrats -- a majority that spent weeks in the winter selecting a House speaker, and a chunk of the fall selecting a replacement.",
      "A few illnesses, special election surprises, or absences could also disrupt Republicans' careful balancing act.",
      "In 1917, Republicans held the narrowest majority in history with a 215-213 edge over Democrats. But a group of minor party lawmakers worked with the minority to elect a speaker, delivering the chamber to Democrats, according to Pew.",

    "story": [
      "The man allegedly brandished an AR 15-style rifle in videos posted to Facebook.",
      "Federal authorities have arrested an Arizona man after he allegedly posted videos online threatening to kill President-elect Donald Trump and his family.",
      "In the videos, posted on Facebook in recent months, Manuel Tamayo-Torres issued an array of bizarre and outlandish claims about Trump, but he also apparently brandished an AR 15-style rifle and other weapons in the videos, and in August he recorded his trip to an arena in Glendale, Arizona, as Trump was holding a campaign rally there, according to charging documents filed in the case.",
      "While the charging documents only refer to Trump as \"Individual 1,\" they say Tamayo-Torres made \"vague yet direct threats\" against \"the president-elect,\" and sources familiar with the investigation separately confirmed Tamayo-Torres' alleged threats targeted Trump.",
      "\"[Y]ou're gonna die,\" Tamayo-Torres allegedly said in a video he posted on Thursday. \"[Y]our son's gonna die. Your whole family is going to die. ... I'm going to put a hole in your face.\"",
      "The clip was one of \"numerous\" rambling and curse-laden videos he's posted \"on a near-daily basis\" in recent months claiming that \"Individual 1\" kidnapped and sex-trafficked his children, according to the charging documents.",
      "It's unclear if Tamayo-Torres actually has children.",
      "Earlier in November, Tamayo-Torres allegedly posted a video threatening \"Individual 1\" while holding up \"what appears to be a white AR 15-style rifle with a 30-round magazine inserted into it,\" charging documents said.",
      "In another video, according to the charging documents, Tamayo-Torres said he witnessed \"Individual 1\" and the Secret Service kidnap his daughter. The video was posted Aug. 23 from Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, where Trump was holding a campaign rally that day.",
      "During the rally, Trump noted that he was \"nearly assassinated\" a month earlier, when a Pennsylvania man, Thomas Crooks, opened fire on him with an AR 15-style rifle during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Authorities have yet to identify a clear motive in that attack.",
      "Trump told rallygoers there are \"risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment.\"",
      "\"When you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what's right,\" Trump said.",
      "While investigating the more recent alleged threats from Tamayo-Torres, an officer from a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives task force found photos on Facebook that showed Tamayo-Torres holding a bullpup-style shotgun, a rifle, and the AR15-style rifle seen in one of his videos, according to charging documents.",
      "Tamayo-Torres was arrested Monday near San Diego, where he anticipated moving soon, court records indicate.",
      "Though he was arrested in California, the charges against him were filed in Arizona. He was charged with one count of making threats against a president or president's successor.",
      "He was also charged with four counts of making false statements during the purchase of a firearm, after he allegedly lied on federal forms a year ago while trying to buy a pistol from a Phoenix gun store.",
      "He swore on those forms that he had not been previously convicted of a felony, but he had been convicted of assault in 2003 in San Diego, so he was legally prohibited from possessing firearms, the charging documents said.",
      "As of Tuesday evening, court records did not list an attorney representing Tamayo-Torres.",

    "title": "Abortions fell 2% the year Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, CDC report finds",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:09:59 -0500",
    "summary": "An annual abortion surveillance report, published Wednesday by the CDC, found the number of abortions performed in the U.S. fell slightly in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions in 2022.",
      "The number of abortions performed in the U.S. fell slightly in 2022, the year the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, a new federal report found.",
      "In 2022, a total of 613,383 legal abortions were reported by 48 areas. Among the 47 areas that consistently reported data from 2021 to 2022, there was a decrease of 2% from the 622,108 abortions performed in 2021 to 609,360, according to the annual abortion surveillance report, published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The 48 areas included 46 states, the District of Columbia and New York City, excluding California, Maryland, New Hampshire and New Jersey.",
      "The abortion rate was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 in 2022, a decrease of 3% from 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women the prior year, according to data from 46 states and New York City.",
      "Rates were lowest in Missouri and highest New Mexico, respectively, in 2022. After Roe v. Wade was overruled, Missouri passed a near-total abortion ban with limited exceptions while abortions remained unrestricted based on gestational duration in New Mexico. However, in 2024, Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution, including abortion care.",
      "Dr. Adam Jacobs, medical director of the division of complex family planning at the Mount Sinai Heath System in New York, said he does not believe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health -- the Supreme Court decision that led to Roe v. Wade's overruling -- is a major reason why abortion rates dropped between 2021 and 2022.",
      "\"Many of the bans did not go into place or a lot of the structural changes did not go into place in the calendar year of 2022, so I don't think you would see that impact in this report,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Jacobs said abortion numbers and rates have been decreasing for years, and key reasons include the Affordable Care Act. The law gives women more access to preventive services, including long-lasting reversible contraception.",
      "The report found that women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions in 2022 and had the highest abortion rates. Comparatively, adolescents under age 15 and women aged 40 or older accounted for the lowest percentages of abortions and had the lowest abortion rates.",
      "Between 2013 and 2022, abortion rates decreased among all age groups except for women between ages 30 and 34, for whom rates increased.",
      "When it came to breaking down the share of abortions based on gestational age, the report found that most abortions, or 78.6%, were performed at 9 weeks gestation and nearly all abortions were performed under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "More than half of abortions were early medication ones performed at or under 9 weeks gestation followed by surgical abortions at or under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "Surgical abortions performed past 13 weeks gestation accounted for just 6.9% of all abortions in 2022 and medication abortion past 9 weeks gestation accounted for 4.3%.",
      "Black women accounted for the highest percentage of abortions at 39.5% followed by white women at 31.9% and Hispanic women at 21.2%, according to the report.",
      "Black women had the highest rate at 24.4 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 and white women had the lowest rate at 5.7 abortions per 1,000 women.",
      "Jacobs said that gains have been made in providing care to marginalized groups, but factors including unequal access to quality family planning services may be why abortion rates are higher for Black women compared to white women.",
      "\"If you have access to highly effective contraception, you end up having [fewer] unintended pregnancies,\" he said.",
      "For 2022, 87.7% of abortions were among unmarried women compared to 12.3% among married women, the report found.",
      "Additionally, a plurality of abortions, or 40.6%, were among women who had never had a previous live birth, and a majority, or 56.1%, were among those who had never received an abortion before.",
      "In 2021, the most recent year for which data from the CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System were reviewed, five women died because of complications from legally induced abortions.",
      "As of Wednesday, 13 states have ceased nearly all abortion services and four states have enacted six-week bans, according to an ABC News tally. Meanwhile, nine states and the District of Columbia have no restrictions based on gestational duration.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:32:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Named to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
    "story": [
      "\"Make America Healthy Again\" would collide with Washington bureaucracy.",
      "Named to lead the nation's sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
      "His Senate confirmation hearings -- should they happen -- will come with lots of questions about what Kennedy's ideas would look like in practice.",
      "His new role would mean relinquishing his outsider critic status and working from within a massive government system, leading an agency of 80,000 employees and dealing with everything from drug approvals to food recalls to the pandemic response.",
      "So, what happens when his motto \"Make America Healthy Again\" collides with one of Washington's largest government bureaucracies?",
      "\"He seems very clear on what it is he wants to get done. I'm just not sure he has an understanding of what it will take to get that done,\" said one former senior HHS official who worked in the Biden administration.",
      "On vaccines, President-elect Donald Trump's picks of Johns Hopkins University professor Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, former GOP Rep. Dave Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as surgeon general certainly add to Kennedy's ability to make changes -- if they're confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Both Makary and Weldon have raised questions about vaccine side effects, although they've also at times been supportive overall of the role vaccines play in public health. Kennedy himself has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by numerous studies.",
      "In their new positions, Makary, Weldon and Kennedy would have the power to select the experts who sit on important FDA and CDC advisory panels. Those panels play a key role in vaccine recommendations and authorizations for the general public, ultimately creating public health guidance for years to come.",
      "\"I think massively, in large part, the health care community would continue to move forward on vaccines as they do now, as they are considered to be one of the massive successes of public health in the last 100 years. And I don't think that would change,\" said Tom Inglesby, a former senior adviser to HHS and the White House during COVID-19 during the Biden administration.",
      "\"But what could change is potentially the cost of vaccines, the access to vaccines, guidance around new vaccines that might come online, and also confusion around public messaging from the federal government about safety and effectiveness of vaccines,\" Inglesby said.",
      "When it comes to chemicals and the food Americans consume, it's less clear how Kennedy could make changes at HHS, as opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture, which have more oversight of areas such as water fluoridation, which Kennedy opposes, or school lunches, which he says he wants to make healthier. He has said, however, that he would gut the entire nutrition department at the FDA.",
      "Kennedy could also move around funding -- he's said he'd deprioritize infectious disease research in favor of chronic illness research, for example. As avian flu cases continue to rise -- raising concerns about a new pandemic -- public health experts and former government officials have pushed back strongly on that idea.",
      "But he has also called for restrictions on food additives, dyes and ultra-processed foods, something he could have direct influence over through the FDA, which determines safe thresholds for the \"Acceptable Daily Intake\" on substances.",
      "Kennedy has generally received a more cautious welcome from the public health community regarding his focus on healthy food.",
      "\"There are some things here that are worth working on. You know, if we're looking at the school lunch program in America, 30 million children get more than half of their calories from that program. It would be a wonderful thing to make that the best school lunch program possible,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former CDC acting director.",
      "But many public health experts are also wary of giving Kennedy credit, for fear it could lend credibility to other false information he promotes. He advocates drinking raw milk, for example, even though the pasteurization process kills off bacteria that can cause serious illness, including the fast-spreading avian flu.",
      "\"One of the dangerous things about RFK Jr. is that there are bits of things he says that are true, and they're mixed in. And it makes it really hard to sort out what things you should follow because they're based on fact, and which things are not,\" Besser told ABC News, where he was former chief health and medical editor.",
      "Experts also question Kennedy's ability to counter powerful Washington lobbies -- one of his stated main goals -- in a Trump administration focused on working with big business on deregulating industries.",
      "Another area where Kennedy could be out of line with the Trump administration is abortion access. Kennedy has said he supports legal abortion access until fetal viability (despite an earlier comment on the campaign trail that he later walked back about supporting a 15-week ban) and that such decisions should be up to women.",
      "Many abortion rights advocates still expect the Trump administration to quickly move to rescind protections and halt legal fights the Biden administration initiated after the fall of Roe v. Wade -- but are hopeful that Kennedy and the broader administration would not attempt sweeping bans.",
      "\"[Trump's] obviously waffled on this and other issues a thousand times so I'm not going to trust every word he says, but I do think there's the possibility that he and his administration has seen that actually, abortion access is very popular,\" said Katie O'Connor, senior director of abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center.",
      "\"We have seen that over the past three elections, and there could be pushback if this administration does something to further restrict abortion access.\"",
      "There are certainly members of Trump's orbit who would support broader restrictions on abortion, but Trump himself has said he would not sign a federal ban if Congress passed one.",
      "Some of the policies O'Connor expects to see rolled back would include the Pentagon paying for service members who need to cross state lines to get an abortion because of where they were stationed, as well as expanded access to abortion pills through telemedicine.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy could undo these rules and also build on the first Trump administration's efforts. He could expand protections for health care providers who don't want to perform abortion procedures, allowing more providers to deny care, and make it more difficult for private insurers to cover abortion, leaving it more expensive for patients, O'Connor said.",
      "Large-scale bans, were they executed, would focus on removing access to the medication abortion pill called mifepristone, either by attempting to take medication abortion off the market by way of the FDA approval process, or employing a very old law called the Comstock Act to prohibit the pills from being mailed.",
      "\"I do hold out hope that this administration doesn't want to expand political capital on abortion,\" O'Connor said.",

      "Starr County, Texas, voted predominantly Republican this month -- for the first time in 100 years.",
      "Home to some 75,000 residents across about 1,200 square miles, it has a relatively small footprint, in a state where everything is glorified for its bigness.",
      "But it's been making an outsized impression in national politics. Even after its historic flip from blue to red, a century in the making, it's continued to garner headlines.",
      "Last week, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham offered up 1,402 acres of Starr County to facilitate President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "In a letter to Trump dated Nov. 19, Buckingham said she's offering the land, located along the border of Mexico, \"to be used to construct deportation facilities.\"",
      "She has also proposed alternative uses for it, including as a site for detention centers.",
      "\"Now it's essentially farmland, so it's flat, it's easy to build on. We can very easily put a detention center on there -- a holding place as we get these criminals out of our country,\" Buckingham said in a recent interview with Fox News.",
      "The land, which Buckingham declared property of the state in 2023, adds to another parcel previously owned by the Texas General Land Office, bringing the southern border acreage that it controls in Starr County up to 4,000.",
      "ABC News' Mireya Villarreal visited Starr County to ask residents what issues and values most influenced them to vote for Republican candidates this year, instead of upholding their century-long blue streak.",
      "\"The economy is just driving, I think, everybody crazy,\" said Becky Garza, the owner of Texas Cafe in Rio Grande City, the largest city in Starr County.",
      "She explained that she used to complain about buying a box of eggs for $10, and now they're $20.",
      "\"If things don't get better, I might have to either cut staff, cut hours, or I'm going to start with cutting hours and then from there work it, maybe cut down, maybe cut the menu, you know, to keep the place open, you know, because I don't want to lose my my customers,\" Garza said.",
      "And she doesn't think she's the only one who's making those kinds of hard decisions, she told ABC News.",
      "Jaime Escobar, the mayor of neighboring Roma, another city of Starr County, agrees. He suggested that residents are more influenced by the local economy than what's being said in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"We no longer want to be considered just a poor community because we're rich culturally,\" he told ABC News. \"We're proud of our Mexican-American heritage, but we don't -- no longer want to be dependent just on the government.\"",
      "But with D.C. being invited into their backyard, it's bound to bring the topic of migration and deportation to the forefront -- even for those who may not have prioritized the issue during the election cycle.",
      "Asked about how people might respond to a detention facility in nearby Starr County, Escobar said, \"People don't want families to be torn apart. That's the last thing we want.\"",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he added, \"we hope that Trump and his administration do the right thing and focus on the criminal element first, and then see how in the meantime, we'll see how the policies can be implemented in a better way.\"",
      "Buckingham, on the other hand, believes that \"folks who live down on the border feel really abandoned by those open border policies.\"",
      "She told ABC News, \"They feel like it's directly harming their communities, both their safety and their prosperity.\"",
      "In the same interview this week with ABC News, Buckingham also said that she would \"absolutely\" offer up even more of Texas, the way that she did Starr County.",
      "\"I have 13 million acres. If any of them can be of help in this process, we're happy to have that discussion,\" Buckingham said.",
      "Trump has said he would carry out his mass deportation plans -- a top campaign promise -- by declaring a national emergency and using \"military assets\" to deport migrants currently living in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "He backed up his commitment with the choice of several immigration hard-liners to join his administration, including South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for secretary of homeland security and former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan as \"border czar.\" Both picks require Senate confirmation.",
      "But with an estimated 11 million people presumed to be living in the U.S. without legal immigration status, the promises have raised questions of both feasibility and cost.",
      "Removing them could cost billions of dollars per year, according to estimates from the American Immigration Council.",
      "And while Republican-friendly areas of Texas might feel compelled to support the effort, other southern border states, like Arizona and California, have already expressed their disinterest.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs told ABC News Live last week that she would not use state police or the National Guard to help with mass deportation.",

      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

      "The move comes 18 months after a Los Angeles County judge threw out much of the 2022 suit in which Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, claimed Wood had fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to fabricate their own allegations.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of fighting a battle where he was able to tell the truth, Brian is pleased to dismiss his still-pending claims and appeal in order to close the door on this chapter of his life,\" Manson attorney Howard King said in a statement.",
      "Manson had been appealing the judge's decision but his attorneys reached out to Wood's seeking a settlement in the spring. Wood's attorneys said Tuesday that she rejected requests that the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Manson \u201cfiled a lawsuit against Ms. Wood as a publicity stunt to try to undermine the credibility of his many accusers and revive his faltering career,\u201d Wood\u2019s lawyer Michael J. Kump said in a statement. \u201cBut his attempt to silence and intimidate Ms. Wood failed.\u201d",
      "Manson agreed to pay nearly $327,000 in attorney fees for Wood.",
      "The settlement comes nearly four years into a criminal investigation of the 55-year-old Manson involving multiple women that remains unresolved. Outgoing LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in October that his office's sex crimes division had just discovered new evidence and that a decision on whether to file charges would be made when the picture was more complete.",
      "The women involved in the criminal case have not been identified, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esme Bianco has said she was among them, and criticized the district attorney for taking so long to investigate. Bianco settled her own lawsuit against Manson last year.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Wood and Bianco have.",
      "Manson has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual acts.",
      "In 2017, with the #MeToo movement gaining momentum, Wood said publicly that she had been raped and abused, and gave testimony on the subject to a Congressional committee in 2018, but did not name anyone in either instance.",
      "Then in a 2020 Instagram post, Wood said it was Manson who had \u201chorrifically abused me for years.\u201d The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "Manson's original lawsuit alleged that Wood and another woman, Ashley Gore, also known as Illma Gore in court papers, defamed him, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say. The suit said Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denied forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.",
      "Other parts of the lawsuit had remained because they were not subject to Wood\u2019s motion, including allegations that Gore hacked Manson\u2019s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was sending illegal pornography, and \u201cswatted\u201d him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.",
      "Gore's part of the lawsuit was dismissed and Manson paid $130,000 in her attorney fees."

      "Bob Menendez has asked a judge to set aside guilty verdicts that forced his resignation from the U.S. Senate and grant a new trial",
      "NEW YORK -- Bob Menendez asked a judge Wednesday to set aside guilty verdicts that forced his resignation from the U.S. Senate and grant a new bribery trial.",
      "Lawyers for the New Jersey Democrat said in papers filed in Manhattan federal court that a recent revelation by prosecutors that improper evidence was put on a computer used by jurors during deliberations means that a new trial is \u201cunavoidable.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old Menendez was convicted in July of 16 charges, including bribery, in part based on an allegation that he accepted bribes in exchange for approving military aid to Egypt.",
      "He awaits a Jan. 29 sentencing. Menendez resigned from the Senate in August.",
      "At trial, prosecutors said Menendez accepted gold and cash from three New Jersey businessmen in return for favors.",
      "Earlier this month, prosecutors revealed in a letter to Judge Sidney H. Stein that they had discovered that some factual information that the judge had ruled should be excluded from several trial exhibits was instead inadvertently loaded onto a computer used by jurors to reach their verdict.",
      "In their letter, prosecutors said incorrect versions of nine government exhibits were missing some redactions ordered by Stein to ensure that the exhibits did not violate the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause, which protects speech relating to information shared by legislators.",
      "Prosecutors argued in their letter that no action was necessary in light of the error for several reasons, including that defense lawyers did not object after they inspected documents on that laptop before it was given to jurors.",
      "They also said there was a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that no jurors saw the erroneously redacted versions of the exhibits and that the documents could not have prejudiced the defendants anyway because they were of \u201csecondary relevance and cumulative with abundant properly admitted evidence.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for Menendez, though, said in their submission Wednesday that the exhibits contained the \u201conly evidence in the record\u201d tying Menendez to military aid to Egypt, \u201can otherwise-missing fact at the very center of the central charge against him.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn light of this serious breach, a new trial is unavoidable, despite all the hard work and resources that went into the first one,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The lawyers criticized the government's attempt to shift blame for the error onto them by saying they viewed the laptop's contents and approved it.",
      "\u201cThat is both factually and legally outrageous,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe defense had only a few hours to review a laptop that contained nearly 3,000 exhibits; it had the right to expect that the government had not mislabeled non-introduced and constitutionally barred exhibits as admitted ones. If this were treated as a waiver, that would give parties the incentive to intentionally try to pull a fast one.\u201d"

      "The European allies have stressed that the lack of depth means that it may soon become untenable for Ukraine to continue to operate in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region. The situation in Kursk has become further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops, who have come to help Moscow try to claw back the land seized in a Ukrainian incursion this year.",
      "The stepped-up push on Ukraine to strengthen its fighting ranks comes as Ukraine braces for President-elect Donald Trump to take office on Jan. 20. The Republican said he would bring about a swift end to the war and has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the vital U.S. military support for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere are no easy answers to Ukraine\u2019s serious manpower shortage, but lowering the draft age would help,\u201d said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"These are obviously difficult decisions for a government and society that has already endured so much due to Russia\u2019s invasion.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has taken steps to broaden the pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military.",
      "In April, Ukraine\u2019s parliament passed a series of laws, including one lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25, aimed at broadening the universe of men who could be called on to join the grinding war.",
      "Those laws also did away with some draft exemptions and created an online registry for recruits. They were expected to add about 50,000 troops, far short of what Zelenskyy said at the time was needed.",
      "Zelenskyy has consistently stated that he has no plans to lower the mobilization age. A senior Ukrainian official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine does not have enough equipment to match the scale of its ongoing mobilization efforts.",
      "The official said Ukrainian officials see the push to the lower the draft age as part of an effort by some Western partners to deflect attention from their own delays in providing equipment or belated decisions. The official cited as an example the delay in giving Ukraine permission to use longer-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory.",
      "The Ukrainians do not see lowering the draft age to recruit more soldiers as a substitute for countering Russia\u2019s advantage in equipment and weaponry, the official said.",
      "Conscription has been a sensitive matter in Ukraine throughout the war. Russia\u2019s own problems with adequate troop levels and planning early in the war prevented Moscow from taking full advantage of its edge. But the tide has shifted and the U.S. says the Ukrainian shortage can no longer be overlooked.",
      "Some Ukrainians have expressed worry that further lowering the minimum conscription age and taking more young adults out of the workforce could backfire by further harming the war-ravaged economy.",
      "The senior Biden administration official added that the administration believes that Ukraine can also optimize its current force by more aggressively dealing with soldiers who desert or go absent without leave.",

      "NEW YORK -- Former TV host Charlie Rose has resolved a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by three women in the wake of his #MeToo-era ouster from CBS News in 2017 and the cancellation of his long-running, eponymous PBS talk show.",
      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \u201cill intent\u201d to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d and \u201cblatant and repeated sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others\u2019 points of view.\"",
      "\u201cOn reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\u201d the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d",
      "Rose\u2019s downfall was part of America\u2019s #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \u201cCharlie Rose Show.\u201d",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. They accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \u201cvery subtle\u201d and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \u201calways professional and respectful.\u201d"

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia's highest court on Wednesday approved the extradition to the United States of a former anti-narcotics chief on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S., a rare ruling against a top security official in the Andean nation whose relations with Washington have been strained for decades.",
      "The decision, which cannot be appealed, caps the rapid downfall of Maximiliano D\u00e1vila, 59, Bolivia's top drug cop in 2019 under former leftist President Evo Morales, the first Indigenous president of Bolivia who became a global anti-imperialist icon for kicking out the U.S. ambassador and Drug Enforcement Administration in 2008.",
      "A former police colonel, D\u00e1vila was indicted in 2022 in New York on federal charges of conspiring to import cocaine to the U.S. and possessing machine guns. The indictment accused D\u00e1vila of leveraging his position to provide top-level protection to cargo planes transporting cocaine through third countries for distribution in the U.S.",
      "The Justice and State Departments also offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his conviction. D\u00e1vila official has denied the charges.",
      "Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court of Justice announced it was granting a formal U.S. request for D\u00e1vila to be extradited on drug conspiracy charges. The U.S. State Department and Department of Justice did not publicly comment on the announcement.",
      "\u201cAfter reviewing the documentation and the corresponding evidence, it has been determined to proceed immediately with D\u00e1vila\u2019s extradition,\u201d said Marco Jaimes, the court's president.",
      "Inside Bolivia, D\u00e1vila is facing money laundering charges. Bolivian authorities arrested him in 2022 as he was allegedly fleeing to Argentina, hauling him to jail in the capital of La Paz where he now remains.",
      "D\u00e1vila led the anti-narcotics agency in Bolivia for the final nine months of Morales\u2019 14-year presidency, which ended abruptly in November 2019. The powerful former coca farmer resigned as street protests erupted after the announcement that he had won re-election to an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "The interim government of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, which took power following Morales' ouster, sacked D\u00e1vila.",
      "But he returned in 2020 under the government of President Luis Arce, Morales' former economy minister. D\u00e1vila served for a year as police commander in Bolivia's central region of Cochabamba, a key hub of the country's coca-leaf production.",
      "An extradition treaty between Bolivia and the U.S. has been in force since 1995, despite decades of uneasy relations marked by America\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and Morales' fierce opposition as a young union leader to U.S. forcible coca eradication policies.",
      "After Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008, the Bush administration did the same and nothing has changed since.",
      "This is the second time in Bolivian history that authorities have approved the extradition to the U.S. of a senior security officer, said Saul Lara, an opposition lawmaker and ex-foreign minister.",
      "The first was in 1995, when Col. Faustino Rico Toro, a former interior minister and anti-drug chief close to brutal Bolivian dictator Luis Garcia Meza, was handed over to U.S. authorities in Miami on cocaine trafficking charges.",
      "From Bolivia, lawyers for D\u00e1vila vowed to challenge the extradition.",
      "\u201cThis is a serious violation of human rights,\u201d said defense attorney Manolo Rojas, promising that he would raise the case with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an organ of the Organization of American States, of which the U.S. is a founding member.",
      "Bolivia's court decision comes as a fierce rivalry escalates between current President Arce and former President Morales, tearing apart the ruling Movement Toward Socialism party ahead of 2025 elections.",
      "Although Morales insists he has nothing to do with D\u00e1vila, Arce's supporters have sought to portray Wednesday's ruling against his former minister as a blow to the political career of the ex-president who seeks to run in the presidential elections next year despite a court ban.",
      "\u201cIn the United States, the former anti-drug czar will surely be able to reveal who his accomplices are. Perhaps it is Evo,\u201d said Senator Virginia Velasco, referring to Morales without elaborating."

      "Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation\u2019s steady decline over the past two years has stalled",
      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation's steady decline over the past two years has stalled in recent months.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, consumer prices rose 2.3% in October from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That is up from just 2.1% in September, though it is still only modestly above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called \u201ccore\u201d prices also picked up, climbing 2.8% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September, according to Commerce's personal consumption expenditures price index. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply since it peaked at 7% in mid-2022, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Yet yearly core inflation has fluctuated between 2.6% and 2.8% since February. Price increases have remained elevated in services, including apartment rents, restaurant meals, and car and home insurance.",
      "The elevated reading could make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut its key rate at the next meeting in December. Next month's inflation data, some of which will be issued a week before the meeting, may play a key role in the Fed's decision.",
      "\u201cThis report will likely provide further ammo to Fed officials who prefer to lower rates gradually,\u201d Omair Sharif, chief economist at Inflation Insights, wrote in a client note, \u201cand may strengthen the argument for a pause at the December FOMC meeting.\u201d",
      "Many economists, however, expect that the Fed will reduce its rate by a quarter-point in December, then delay further cuts while gauging the impact of the reductions they've made so far.",
      "\u201cThe momentum in inflation toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target has sputtered recently but not enough, in our view, to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates in December,\u201d Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a client note.",
      "Last month, grocery prices barely rose and gas costs fell, providing some relief to household budgets. Prices at the pump have continued to decline since October, reaching a nationwide average of $3.07 a gallon Wednesday, down six cents from a month earlier, according to AAA.",
      "Used car and truck prices, however, shot up 2.8% from September to October, though they are still 5% lower than a year ago. Air fares jumped 1.5% just last month and have risen 5.1% from a year earlier, while hotel room prices rose 0.5% from September to October. Restaurant prices moved up 0.3% in October and 3.6% from a year earlier. All the yearly increases are higher than they were pre-pandemic.",
      "Wednesday's report also underscored that Americans' incomes and spending remained healthy, a key reason the economy has kept growing this year despite widespread fears of a slowdown. Incomes grew 0.6% from September to October, faster than economists had expected, while consumer spending rose by a solid 0.4% last month.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory could also slow Fed rate cuts. His proposals to cut taxes and reduce government regulation could spur faster growth, but could also overheat the economy and lift inflation. And his threats to impose widespread tariffs, if carried out, would likely push up prices.",
      "The Fed had signaled it would cut rates four times next year, but financial markets now expect just two reductions."

      "NEW YORK -- After weeks of plugging increasingly inviting discounts, retailers in the United States and several other countries are preparing for prime time: Black Friday, the bargain bonanza that still reigns as the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season even if it's lost some luster.",
      "Department stores, shopping malls and merchants \u2014 big and small \u2014 see the day after Thanksgiving as a way to energize shoppers and to get them into physical stores at a time when many gift-seekers are content to do their browsing online. There are enough traditionalists that Black Friday remains the biggest day of the year for retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Texas resident Emily Phillips said while visiting the Galleria Dallas last week. \u201cI save up all the things that I want all year and usually try and get them around Black Friday. I prefer to shop in person because then I can try stuff on. It\u2019s a better experience.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., analysts envision a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under financial pressure and cautious with their discretionary spending despite the easing of inflation.",
      "Retailers will be even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minnesota, is giving the first 200 people in line at the center's north entrance a $25 gift card. Target is offering an exclusive book devoted to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and a bonus edition of her \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d album that only will be available in stores on Black Friday before customers can buy them online starting Saturday.",
      "Best Buy has introduced an extended-release version of the doorbuster, the limited-time daily discounts that for years were all the rage \u2014 and sometimes the spark for actual brawls \u2014 before the coronavirus pandemic. The nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain has released doorbuster deals on its app, online and in stores every Friday since Nov. 8 and plans to continue the weekly promotion through Dec. 20.",
      "\u201c(Stores) are very hungry for Black Friday to do well,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cThey recognize that they\u2019re not going to clobber and win big growth in online because the pie has gotten so competitive. They have to find a way to win in the stores.\u201d",
      "Impulse purchases and self-gifting are a potential area for big sales growth, and business isn't going to increase without them, Cohen said. Shoppers are three times more likely to buy on impulse at a physical store than online, according to Circana research.",
      "Shoppers stepped up their spending at American retailers in October, the Commerce Department said. Although sales at auto dealers drove much of the gain, electronics and appliance stores, and bars and restaurants also saw increased purchases, a sign of healthy consumer spending.",
      "The latest quarterly results from Best Buy, Target and other retailers, however, underscored that some will have an easier time than others getting customers to part with their cash.",
      "Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, is heading into the holidays with strong momentum after ratcheting up better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales for toys, home goods and groceries. But Target reported sluggish quarterly sales as cautious consumers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "Many retailers pushed holiday sales earlier in October than they did last year to help shoppers spread out their spending.",
      "Shoppers were distracted heading into this month's U.S. presidential election. Sales of general merchandise dropped 9% the two weeks ended Nov. 9, according to Circana, but have been rebounding since the election.",
      "The National Retail Federation predicted that shoppers would increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending increased 3.9% over 2022.",
      "So far this holiday season, online sales have beaten expectations, according to Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe. U.S. consumers spent \u202f$77.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Nov. 24, 9.6%\u202f more than during the same period last year. Adobe predicted an 8.4% increase for the full season.",
      "Despite the early sales, better bargains are coming with Black Friday, according to Adobe. Analysts consider the five-day Black Friday weekend, which includes Cyber Monday, a key barometer of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend for the rest of the season.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said shoppers are paying more attention to discounts than last year, and their focus on bargain-hunting will drive what sells and when.",
      "For example, Thanksgiving Day is the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, toys, furniture and appliances, according to Adobe's analysis. But Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs online. People shopping for televisions earlier in the season found discounts that averaged 10.8%, while waiting until this Friday is expected to yield 24% discounts, Adobe Digital Insights said.",
      "Cyber Monday, however, is expected to be the best time to buy clothing and gadgets like phones and computers online. Electronics discounts peaked at 10.9% off the suggested manufacturer's price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 24 but are expected to hit 30% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then go down to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "For physical stores, the day after Thanksgiving is slated to again mark the busiest single shopping day of the season, according to retail technology company Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cBlack Friday is still an incredibly important day for retailers,\u201d Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to be able to get shoppers into their store to show them that experience of what it\u2019s like to browse and touch and feel items. It also can be a bellwether for retailers on what to expect for the rest of the holiday season.\u201d",
      "Mall of America hopes to surpass the 12,000 shoppers it saw last year within the first hour of its 7 a.m. opening.",
      "\u201cPeople come to get the deals, but more importantly, they come for the excitement, the energy, the traditions surrounding Black Friday,\u201d Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer, said."

      "WASHINGTON -- Vaping is coming before the Supreme Court next week as federal regulators ask the high court to uphold its block on sweet, flavored products following a spike in youth e-cigarette use.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has denied more than a million marketing applications for candy- or fruit-flavored products that appeal to kids, part of a wider crackdown that advocates say helped drive down teen vaping after an \u201cepidemic level\u201d surge in 2019.",
      "Vaping companies, though, said the agency unfairly disregarded arguments that their sweet e-liquid products would help adults quit smoking traditional cigarettes without putting kids at greater risk.",
      "Republican Donald Trump's administration could take a different approach after he vowed in a September social-media post to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday is hearing arguments in the FDA\u2019s appeal of a decision from the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. While other courts upheld FDA refusals, the appeals court sided with the Dallas-based company Triton Distribution.",
      "It tossed out a decision blocking the marketing of nicotine-laced liquids like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" that are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Triton said the FDA had unfairly changed its requirements without enough warning.",
      "\u201cIt sort of pulls the chair out from the applicants,\u201d said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA associate commissioner and attorney who now represents other small electronic tobacco companies.",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available. The agency has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.",
      "The marketing refusals combined with age-limit enforcement on the federal and state levels have helped drive down youth nicotine use to its lowest level in a decade, said Dennis Henigan, vice president for legal and regulatory affairs at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.",
      "He says the FDA was clear in its requirements and fears a court decision that leads to wider availability for flavored vape products, which are the dominant choice among the 1.6 million high school students who still vape. \u201cWe think that would be a real harm to public health,\u201d Henigan said."

      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- A law requiring Missouri voters to show government-issued photo identification to cast regular ballots will stand after a lower-court judge found it constitutional Tuesday.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem's decision upholds the law, which was made possible by a 2016 voter-approved constitutional amendment allowing lawmakers to enact photo ID requirements.",
      "\u201cTo maintain a secure system for voting, it only stands to reason that a photo ID should be essential,\u201d Missouri Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said in a statement praising the ruling.",
      "Voter photo ID supporters such as Ashcroft say the practice prevents voter fraud and improves public confidence in election results. Voting rights advocates say getting the records needed to obtain proper photo identification can be challenging, especially for older voters and people with disabilities.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 21 ask for a photo ID.",
      "Under Missouri\u2019s law, people without government-issued photo identification can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures.",
      "The law also requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote.",
      "Missouri's NAACP and League of Women Voters, along with two individual voters, sued to overturn the law in 2022. They argued that some voters faced substantial obstacles getting up-to-date and accurate government-issued photo IDs and worried that casting a provisional ballot could put them at higher risk of having their votes not counted.",
      "Beetem initially dismissed the lawsuit, finding neither of the two individual voters \u201calleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement.\u201d",
      "The Missouri ACLU and Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, in response added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional.",
      "Beetem noted in his Tuesday ruling that all of the individual plaintiffs have successfully voted since the law took effect.",
      "\u201cTheir claim that their provisional ballots may be rejected is purely speculative,\u201d Beetem wrote. \u201cIn addition, the evidence at trial confirms that rejection rates for provisional ballots are low, and the rates specifically for signature-mismatch are exceedingly low.\u201d",
      "He concluded that the law's rules on photo identification \u201cprotect the fundamental right to vote by deterring difficult to detect forms of voter fraud.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they will appeal Beetem's ruling.",
      "\u201cThe League believes the state should be making it easier, not harder, for Missourians to exercise their fundamental right to vote,\" Missouri League of Women Voters President Marilyn McLeod said in a statement. \"There\u2019s no evidence of voter impersonation in Missouri, so these restrictions don\u2019t make our elections any safer or more secure.\u201d",

The U.S. has recently stepped up weapons shipments and has forgiven billions in loans provided to Kyiv.",
      "Trump has criticized the billions the Biden administration has spent in supporting Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.",
      "As a co-chairman of the American First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, Kellogg wrote several of the chapters in the group\u2019s policy book. The book, like the Heritage Foundation\u2019s \u201cProject 2025,\u201d is designed to lay out a Trump national security agenda and avoid the mistakes of 2016 when he entered the White House largely unprepared.",
      "Kellogg in April wrote that \u201cbringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties.\u201d",
      "Trump's proposed national security adviser, U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, tweeted Wednesday that \u201cKeith has dedicated his life to defending our great country and is committed to bringing the war in Ukraine to a peaceful resolution.\u201d",
      "Kellogg featured in multiple Trump investigations dating to his first term. He was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 2019 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump prodded his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations into the Bidens.",

      "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
      "DENVER -- Amid renewed interest in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey triggered in part by a new Netflix documentary, police in Boulder, Colorado, refuted assertions this week that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of the 6-year-old girl that they are not pursuing.",
      "JonBenet Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family\u2019s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States.",
      "The police comments came as part of their annual update on the investigation, a month before the 28th anniversary of JonBenet\u2019s killing. Police said they released it a little earlier because of the increased attention on the case, apparently referring to the three-part Netflix series \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the department welcomes news coverage and documentaries about the killing of JonBenet, who would have been 34 this year, as a way to generate possible new leads. He said the department is committed to solving the case but needs to be careful about what it shares about the investigation to protect a possible future prosecution.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you though, is we have thoroughly investigated multiple people as suspects throughout the years and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,\" he said.",
      "The Netflix documentary focuses on the mistakes made by police and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d surrounding the case.",
      "JonBenet was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.",
      "Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet's clothing that pointed to the involvement of an \u201cunexplained third party\u201d in her slaying.",
      "The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys \u201cvictims of this crime.\u201d",
      "John Ramsey has continued to speak out for the case to be solved. In 2022, he supported an online petition asking Colorado\u2019s governor to intervene in the investigation by putting an outside agency in charge of DNA testing in the case. In the Netflix documentary, he said he has been advocating for several items that have not been prepared for DNA testing to be tested and for other items to be retested.

      "In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees.",
      "In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn\u2019t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022 noted that some evidence could be \u201cconsumed\u201d if DNA testing is done on it.",
      "Last year, police said they convened a panel of outside experts to review the investigation to give recommendations and determine if updated technologies or forensic testing might produce new leads.

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- An Alabama man charged with killing four people in September has now been charged with capital murder in a separate quadruple homicide that took place in July, according to law enforcement officials.",
      "Damien McDaniel, 22, has been arrested and charged with capital murder in connection with the July 13 mass shooting outside of a nightclub in Birmingham that left four people dead and 10 others wounded, Officer Truman Fitzgerald announced at a press conference Tuesday evening. McDaniel is also accused of three separate fatal shootings that took place on three separate days in August and September.",
      "Another man, Hatarius Woods, 27, was also charged with capital murder in connection with the July mass shooting.",
      "\u201cThese individuals started back in July, and they did not stop from September,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cWe often say on these crime scenes that we have a few select criminals that add to this crime and give Birmingham a bad name.\u201d",
      "Woods and McDaniel are allegedly responsible for approximately 30% of all homicides that took place in the city between July and September, Fitzgerald said. Attorneys for Woods and McDaniel did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Including the charges announced Tuesday, McDaniel is accused of killing 11 people and wounding 29 others in five separate incidents over two months \u2014 one of those charges is in connection with the Sept. 21 mass shooting outside of a different nightclub, where four people were fatally shot and 17 others injured.",
      "Fitzgerald said on Tuesday that there were \u201cmultiple shooters\u201d in the September mass shooting, and the investigation is ongoing. The September shooting was Birmingham\u2019s third mass shooting of the year.",
      "Birmingham surpassed the decades-long homicide record set in 2022 after a fatal shooting Sunday marked the 145th homicide in 2024.",
      "In a 30-minute long video released Tuesday night, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sat in front of a table with 145 guns on it to represent the number of homicides in the city since the beginning of the year.

      "\u201cEven if I give you more officers on our streets, people are still legally allowed to drive around with these types of guns,\u201d Woodfin said, gesturing to the guns in front of him. Woodfin said he supported the Second Amendment but also wanted to let voters across the city decide whether to place more restrictions on gun permitting.",
      "\u201cIf I was a betting man, I would believe the residents of Birmingham have had enough of this and want to see more gun safety laws in place that protect people in Birmingham, but that has to come from a level higher than me,\u201d Woodfin said.",

      "When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state.",
      "Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 percentage points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.",
      "Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior\u2019s application process \u201cflawed\u201d and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy that we\u2019re sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,\u201d Lowery said.",
      "Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.",
      "Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.",
      "Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said \"no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\u201d",
      "Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like healthcare through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.",
      "The Lumbee Tribe has applied for federal recognition, but that petition was denied in 1985 because it \u201ccould not establish the group\u2019s descendency either culturally, politically, or genealogically from any tribe which existed historically in the area.\u201d",
      "In 2016, the Interior reversed a decision barring the Lumbee Tribe from reapplying, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.",
      "Gaining federal recognition through legislation is a rare but not unheard of path. But the Lumbee's approach has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.",
      "But perhaps the state-recognized tribe\u2019s most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "Tillis introduced the Lumbee Fairness Act last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.",
      "One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis\u2019s state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation\u2019s homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appalling to me. It\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.",
      "Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee\u2019s historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes \u2014 the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians \u2014 have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.",
      "Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.",
      "Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.",
      "\u201cThis is not about you,\u201d Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. \u201cBut you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.\u201d",
      "Tillis suggested it was a \u201ccasino cartel\u201d in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.",
      "In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should \u201capologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.\u201d",
      "Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s put a hold on the bill it\u2019s because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they\u2019re not in support,\u201d Lowery said. \u201cSo, he said \u2018well, if you can\u2019t be supportive of my bill, I can\u2019t be supportive of your bill.\u2019\u201d",

    "summary": "The drubbing Democrats took in Pennsylvania has prompted vows to rebound",
    "story": [
      "The drubbing Democrats took in Pennsylvania has prompted vows to rebound",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The drubbing Democrats took in Pennsylvania in this year's election has prompted predictable vows to rebound, but it has also sowed doubts about whether Pennsylvania might be leaving the ranks of up-for-grabs swing states for a right-leaning existence more like Ohio's.",
      "The introspection over voters' rejection of Democrats comes amid growing speculation about Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a contender for the party\u2019s 2028 presidential nomination.",
      "Widely expected to seek reelection in the 2026 mid-terms, Shapiro was considered a rising star in the party even before he garnered heavy national attention for making Vice President Kamala Harris' shortlist of candidates for running mates.",
      "Some Pennsylvania Democrats say 2024\u2019s losses are, at least in part, attributable to voters motivated specifically by President-elect Donald Trump. Many of those voters won't show up if Trump isn't on the ballot, the theory goes, leaving Pennsylvania's status as the ultimate swing state intact.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an indicator for Pennsylvania,\u201d said Jamie Perrapato, executive director of Turn PA Blue, which helps organize and train campaign volunteers. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when these people come out and vote in any elections but for the presidency.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania's status as the nation's premier battleground state in 2024 was unmistakable: political campaigns dropped more money on campaign ads than in any other state, according to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "Plenty of that money was spent by Democrats, but their defeat was across the board. Democrats in Pennsylvania lost its 19 presidential electoral votes, a U.S. Senate seat, three other statewide races, two congressional seats and what was once a reassuring advantage in voter registration.",
      "Some of those losses were particularly notable: Democrats hadn\u2019t lost Pennsylvania's electoral votes and a Senate incumbent in the same year since 1880. The defeat of three-term Sen. Bob Casey is especially a gut-punch for Democrats: the son of a former governor has served in statewide office since 1997.",
      "The same debate that Democrats are having nationally over Harris\u2019 decisive loss is playing out in Pennsylvania, with no agreement on what caused them to be so wrong.",
      "Some blamed President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native, for backtracking on his promise not to run for reelection. Some blamed the party\u2019s left wing and some blamed Harris, saying she tried to woo Republican voters instead of focusing on pocketbook issues that were motivating working-class voters.",
      "In Pennsylvania, finger-pointing erupted in the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia \u2014 where Trump significantly narrowed his 2020 deficit \u2014 between the city's Democratic Party chair and a Harris campaign adviser.",
      "The nation\u2019s sixth-most populous city is historically a driver of Democratic victories statewide, but Harris' margin there was the smallest of any Democratic presidential nominee since John Kerry's in 2004, and turnout there was well below the statewide average.",
      "Rural Democrats suggested the party left votes on the table in their regions, too. Some said Harris hurt herself by not responding forcefully enough in the nation\u2019s No. 2 natural gas state against Trump's assertions that she would ban fracking.",
      "Ed Rendell, the former two-term governor of Pennsylvania and ex-Democratic National Committee chair, said Trump had the right message this year and that Harris didn\u2019t have enough time on the campaign trail to counter it.",
      "Still, Rendell said Pennsylvania remains very much a swing state.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go crazy over these election results,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cIt\u2019s still tight enough to say that in 2022 the Democrats swept everything and you would have thought that things looked pretty good for us, and this time we almost lost everything.\u201d",
      "That year, Shapiro won the governor\u2019s office by nearly 15%, John Fetterman was the only candidate in the nation to flip a U.S. Senate seat despite suffering a stroke in the midst of his campaign, and Democrats captured control of the state House of Representatives for the first time in a dozen years.",
      "Bethany Hallam, an Allegheny County council member who is part of a wave of progressive Democrats to win office around Pittsburgh in recent years, said the party can fix things before Pennsylvania becomes Ohio. But she cautioned against interpreting 2024 as a one-time blip, saying it would be a mistake to think Trump voters will never be heard from again.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to be more empowered to keep voting more,\u201d Hallam said. \u201cThey came out, finally exercised their votes and the person they picked won. \u2026 I don\u2019t think this was a one-off thing.\u201d",
      "Shapiro, assuming he seeks another term in 2026, would likely benefit from a mid-term backlash that has haunted the party in power \u2014 in this case, Republicans and Trump \u2014 in nearly every election since World War II.",
      "The political landscape never stays the same, and voters two years from now will be reacting to a new set of factors: the state of the economy, the ups and downs of Trump's presidency, events no one sees coming.",
      "Rendell predicted that Trump\u2019s public approval ratings will be badly damaged \u2014 below 40% \u2014 even before he takes office.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, fully expect Republicans to come after Shapiro in an effort to damage any loftier ambitions he may have.",
      "They say they\u2019ll be ready.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s on the MAGA radar,\u201d said Michelle McFall, the Westmoreland County Democratic Party chair. \u201cHe\u2019s a wildly popular governor in what is still the most important battleground state ... and we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re in fighting shape to hold that seat.\u201d",
      "In 2025, partisan control of the state Supreme Court will be up for grabs when three Democratic justices elected a decade ago must run to retain their seats in up-or-down elections without an opponent. Republicans have it marked on their calendars.",
      "Democrats will go into those battles with their narrowest voter registration edge in at least a half-century. What was an advantage of 1.2 million voters in 2008, the year Barack Obama won the presidency, is now a gap of fewer than 300,000.",
      "University of Pennsylvania researchers found that, since the 2020 presidential election, Republican gains weren\u2019t because Republicans registered more new voters.",
      "Rather, the GOP\u2019s gains were from more Democrats switching their registration to Republican, a third party or independent, as well as more inactive Democratic voters being removed from registration rolls, the researchers reported.",
      "Democrats have won more statewide elections in the past 25 years, but the parties are tied in that category in the five elections from 2020 through 2024.",
      "Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said it is hard to predict that Pennsylvania is trending in a particular direction, since politics are evolving and parties that lose tend to adapt.",
      "Even when Democrats had larger registration advantages, Hopkins said, Republicans competed on a statewide playing field.",
      "Hopkins said Democrats should be worried that they lost young voters and Hispanic voters to Trump, although the swing toward the GOP was relatively muted in Pennsylvania. Trump\u2019s 1.8 percentage-point victory was hardly a landslide, he noted, and it signals that Pennsylvania will be competitive moving forward.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that the registration numbers are destiny,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s partly because even with Democrats losing their registration advantage, whichever party can win the unaffiliated voters by a healthy margin will carry the state.\u201d",

      "Applications for pension credit - allowing low-income pensioners to also receive winter fuel payments - have seen a sharp rise since the government announced cost-cutting plans.",

      "The decision announced in July has led to 150,000 applications for pension credit being submitted since, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).",
      "But only 42,500 have been successful, with thousands being rejected and others awaiting a decision.",
      "Most people will be eligible for the new, means-tested winter fuel payment only if they have registered first to receive pension credit.",
      "Some 150,000 applications for pension credit have been submitted in the 16 weeks since July 29, when the chancellor made her announcement.",
      "That was a 145% increase compared with the previous 16 weeks. However, the number of people being awarded pension credit has only increased by 17% over the same period.",
      "The high number of rejections could be people failing to meet the criteria, or failing to submit the 24-page, 223-question form properly.",

      "\"With December 21 approaching, my message is clear: check if you are eligible for pension credit and if you are then apply, as it unlocks a range of benefits including the winter fuel payment.\"",

    "summary": "The trade body for the sector says these are \"deeply concerning times\" for the UK's car industry.",
    "story": [
      "UK car production fell sharply in October amid industry concerns about \"intense pressure\" on investment in electric vehicle-making.",
      "Output of all cars dropped by more than 15% from a year earlier, mainly due to a fall in exports following weak demand, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.",
      "Production of electric and hybrid vehicles declined by a third compared with last year, due to flagging European demand and the retooling of factories for new models.",
      "The figures come after Vauxhall maker Stellantis said this week it would close its Luton van-making factory, partly due to rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles in the UK.",
      "In addition, Ford said last week it would cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years because of difficult trading conditions, including intense competition and less demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"These are deeply concerning times for the automotive industry, with massive investments in plants and new zero emission products under intense pressure.\"",
      "Globally, demand for EVs has slowed, he said, while in the UK, manufacturers have to contend with \"the toughest targets and most accelerated timeline\" without the incentives necessary for customers to drive demand.",
      "Although production of EVs fell in October, sales of electric cars in the UK have been increasing.",
      "In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered, although industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "There has been a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "Under the UK's zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine - but they can also buy \"credits\" from firms that can meet this mandate.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said there will be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced.",
      "However, he also reiterated Labour's commitment to the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said the government knew the industry \"needs certainty and stability\" and was investing \u00a32bn in car manufacturing and more than \u00a3300m to support the uptake of electric vehicles.",
      "\"We continue to work closely with the sector to make the transition a success,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ministers told in July of 'likely' Vauxhall closure",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "Luton plant closure",
      "The closure of Stellantis' factory at Luton will put 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "The former UK manufacturing lead for Stellantis, Mark Noble, told the BBC of his \u201cdisappointment, shock, and anger\u201d about the closure plans.",
      "He said the site was closing \"for a number of reasons that are external to the plant\", including uncertainty over Brexit tariffs and the ZEV mandate.",
      "He said troubles for Stellantis' UK plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port \"started with Brexit\" because it \"caused a lot of uncertainty\".",
      "\"When you've got two UK plants that export 80%+ of their build, with the tariff confusion and no clarity that really hurt the two plants.\"",
      "He added that for the ZEV mandate the government \"has to decide: is this a tax, a \u00a36bn tax on the car companies, or is it their mandate to go green?\"",
      "\"They need to make it possible for the car manufacturers to meet these targets,\" he said.",
      "He added that there were still barriers to mass adoption of EVs, including a lack of charging infrastructure.",
      "\"If everybody bought an electric vehicle tomorrow, I don\u2019t see how we charge them,\" he said.",
      "However, Vicky Read, chief executive of EV charging industry body Charge UK, told the BBC a charger \"is being installed every 25 minutes\".",
      "Charging rollout is reliant on private sector funding, so talk of electric car targets being weakened is \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d, she said.",
      "According to government figures, there are more than 71,000 public charge points in the UK, with 57 added on average each day.",
      "Government adviser James Richardson, the director of analysis for the Climate Change Committee, told the BBC that traditional car companies were at risk of being overtaken by new competitors.",
      "\"Companies don't always see how quickly these markets can change, and then they can get left behind,\" he said.",
      "He said electric sales targets were \"really helping to send that signal to companies that they need to move fast, or competitors will come in and take the market from them\"."

    "summary": "Fuel retailers' profit margins remain \"stubbornly high\", the competition watchdog says.",
    "story": [
      "Drivers are paying more for fuel than they should because retailers' profit margins remain \"stubbornly high\", the competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said sellers' margins - the difference between what a retailer pays for its fuel and what it sells at - remained higher than historic levels, although fuel prices have fallen since July.",
      "It said supermarkets' margins had risen to 8.1% in August from 7% in April.",
      "The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said sellers were pricing fuel as \u201clow as possible in a highly competitive market\u201d while also grappling with increasing costs.",
      "But the CMA said the \"sustained\" increase in fuel prices was concerning and there was not enough competition in the fuel market, which continued to drive prices up.",
      "Non-supermarket fuel margins rose had risen to 10.2% in August from 7.8% in April, the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cWhile fuel prices have fallen since July, drivers are paying more for fuel than they should be as they continue to be squeezed by stubbornly high fuel margins,\" said Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA.",
      "\"We therefore remain concerned about weak competition in the sector and the impact on pump prices,\" he added, especially while costs of living remain high.",
      "\"The more people save on fuel, the more they have to spend in other areas\", he said.",
      "The average petrol price at the end of October was 134.4p per litre, and for diesel it was 139.7p.",
      "However, the PRA's executive director, Gordon Balmer, said it was crucial that the  increasing costs facing retailers - notably business rates, National Insurance and the minimum wage  - were included in future analysis to \"give a complete picture\".",
      "\"The CMA reporting that retailers continue to pump their fuel margins for extra profit will stir anger once again \u2013 particularly when set against the background of the government continuing the fuel duty freeze,\u201d says Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s spokesman on road fuel prices.",
      "He added that as retailers now have to pay increased National Insurance contributions, higher wages and increased energy bills, it was hard to see what a \"reasonable addition\" was to fuel prices, and what counted as \"bloated margins\".",
      "Motoring group RAC said the CMA's findings were \"disappointing\", especially after the regulator said in July that drivers had been overcharged on fuel by \u00a31.6bn in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe hope the introduction of the government-backed fuel finder scheme next year will succeed in driving greater competition and enable drivers all around the UK to benefit from fairer prices\", said the RAC's Simon Williams.",
      "The fuel finder scheme will allow drivers to compare real-time fuel prices and is due to be introduced by the end of 2025.",
      "The government in January said the information, which will be available on online comparison sites and navigation apps, should drive down prices because of the added transparency.",

      "The Black Friday sales are already in full swing and it can be easy to get swept up in the shopping frenzy and end up out of pocket - instead of bagging a bargain.",
      "The vast majority of Black Friday offers are cheaper or the same price at other times of the year, consumer group Which? has warned.",
      "We've spoken to some experts who have shared tips on how to shop Black Friday without being ripped off.",
      "Make a list and stick to it",
      "\"It's only a deal if it\u2019s something you genuinely wanted or needed before seeing the discount,\" said Sarah Johnson, director of merchandise consultancy Flourish Retail.",
      "She recommends making a list and budget to stick to in order to avoid impulse buys.",
      "\"Make the deals work for you by using Black Friday to save on products you already planned to buy,\" she said.",
      "\"If you stick to your list and stay within your budget, you\u2019ll maximise your savings without unnecessary splurges.\"",
      "Compare historic prices",
      "\u201cWhen looking to make a purchase, it's worth comparing the price at multiple retailers,\" said Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine.",
      "He also recommended using websites that allow you to check a product\u2019s price history over the previous 12 months.",
      "\"That way you\u2019ll know a good deal when you see one,\" he said.",
      "Which? investigated deals on 227 products at eight of the biggest home and tech retailers in the UK in last year\u2019s Black Friday \"fortnight\" between 20 November and 1 December.",
      "Its research suggested nine in 10 of the deals analysed were the same price or cheaper at other times of the year.",
      "Mr Rose said you should not feel \"pressured to splash out on Black Friday purchases as those deals are usually repeated - if not beaten - at other times of the year.\"",
      "Search for second-hand",
      "If you spot something you want to buy in the Black Friday sale, search for it on a second-hand platform where you might find it even cheaper, says resale influencer, Jess.",
      "Many resale platforms give you the option of offering a price that matches your budget, she said.",
      "\"If you make an offer and it\u2019s reasonable most sellers will accept,\" she said. \"So not only are you likely to get a good deal in the first place because it\u2019s not new from a shop but you can offer a lower price.\"",
      "Vintage clothing influencer Vivien Tang also buys and sells on resale websites.",
      "\"I think it is very easy to find almost new or brand new items on second-hand platforms,\" she said. \"The condition option on listings is now compulsory so it makes it easier to filter for newer items.\"",
      "If you're using the Black Friday sale to buy Christmas presents you should not rule out buying second hand, according to a new report.",
      "Some 63% of people would be comfortable receiving second-hand Christmas gifts and a further 26% felt neutral about the idea, according to a survey by research consultancy Retail Economics for second-hand marketplace Vinted.",
      "Beware of debt",
      "Many people will use a credit card, or may dip into their overdraft, when buying what they consider bargain items on Black Friday.",
      "But if you end up paying interest, this could outstrip any saving made on the Black Friday promotion.",
      "Using a typical credit card to make a \u00a3300 purchase, then paying back at \u00a320 a month would take more than a year to pay off and mean having to pay \u00a355 in interest, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "Using an overdraft would usually lead to an even bigger interest bill.",
      "A credit card offers more protection when buying something over \u00a3100, so there is greater chance of a refund if something goes wrong.",
      "Financial experts say paying off a credit card immediately, perhaps from savings, before any interest is accrued, is the safest option.",
      "Check for scams",
      "Criminals use the hype around Black Friday to try to steal from online shoppers.",
      "Purchase scams are when someone is tricked into sending money via a bank transfer to buy something - often advertised online or via social media - that doesn't exist.",
      "The number of purchase scams soared by 29% around Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year, according to analysis by Lloyds Bank.",
      "The bank's fraud prevention director, Liz Ziegler, said: \"When shopping online, the best way stay safe is to buy from a trusted retailer, and always pay by card for the greatest protection. If you\u2019re unable to do those things, that should be a big red flag that you\u2019re about to get scammed.\"",
      "You should be wary of fake websites and check the web address belongs to the official brand before you enter any financial or personal information, according to Which?.",
      "Beware of posts from a newly-created social media accounts, or links to a recently-created website. You can use verified domain checkers to confirm when a website was created, Which? said.",

    "story": [
      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "The president-elect already has a close, high-profile relationship with another of the leading figures in tech, X owner Elon Musk.",
      "Historically, though, there has been no such closeness between Trump and Mr Zuckerberg - with Trump barred from Facebook and Instagram after the Capitol riots, and Trump threatening the Meta boss with jail if he interfered in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "However, there has recently been evidence those strained relations are improving, culminating in Mr Zuckerberg dining with the president-elect at his Florida mansion.",
      "\"Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming administration,\"  a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"It\u2019s an important time for the future of American Innovation,\" the statement added.",
      "Jail threat",

      "But the president-elect subsequently softened his position, telling a podcast in October it was \"nice\" Mr Zuckerberg was \"staying out of the election\", and thanking him for a personal phone call after he faced an assassination attempt.",
      "There have have also been indications Mr Zuckerberg is attempting to be more accommodating towards America's incoming president.",
      "Trump was thrown off Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram in 2021 for what the company called his \"praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "But that suspension has since been lifted.",
      "In August this year, Mr Zuckerberg spoke of his regret at de-promoting content relating to allegations about Joe Biden's son Hunter, which had been a right-wing talking point in the US prior to the 2020 presidential election.",
      "He also said he would make no more contributions to support electoral infrastructure, after a $400m (\u00a3302m) donation in 2020 was viewed by some online as a way of skirting donation limits.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg said his donations had been designed to be non-partisan, and his goal was to be neutral in elections.",
      "Big tech buddies",

      "Meta has though been facing increasing regulation in recent years, including an ongoing antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020.",
      "Even so, Mr Zuckerberg's apparently improving relations with the president-elect have been totally eclipsed by Trump's closeness to Elon Musk.",

      "Their relationship is so tight it has caused some to dub Musk his \"First Buddy\", a play on the president's wife being named First Lady.",
      "It has ultimately led to the billionaire being placed in charge of a new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which may give him not only influence over government policy, but the very regulation threatening his business empire.",

      "Some of their disagreements stem from serious business matters, such as a failed collaboration in 2016 when a SpaceX rocket exploding while carrying a Facebook satellite.",
      "Their beef rumbled on eventually becoming a war of words over a potential cagefight.",

      "In 2022, tough US regulations on the import of goods from Xinjiang came into effect.",

      "\u201cThere are 1.4 billion people in China and we only have 900 to 1,000 stores,\" he says. \"I think we can increase that to 3,000.\u201d",

      "In 2009, when 80% of its products were made in China, Mr Yanai told the BBC that China was getting too expensive and the firm was shifting production away \"to lower-wage Cambodia to keep prices low\".",
      "He now says it was challenging to repeat China's success as the world's factory in other countries as transferring years of experience proved difficult.",
      "Retailers like Uniqlo are also facing intense competition from ultra-fast fashion as brands like China's Shein and Temu gain popularity with price-conscious customers.",
      "But Mr Yanai says \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a future for fast fashion\".",
      "\"They\u2019re producing clothes without any careful consideration which you only wear for one season. That is a waste of the planet\u2019s resources.\"",
      "He adds that Uniqlo's strategy is to focus on essential items that can be worn for years.",
      "In the 40 years that he has been in charge of the firm, Mr Yanai has grown the business he inherited from his father from a company with annual sales of around 100 million yen ($656,700; \u00a3522,400) to a global chain with 3 trillion yen of revenues this year.",
      "The 75-year-old says he aims to overtake Inditex, which owns the global chain Zara, as the world's biggest fashion retailer before he retires.",
      "But to achieve that, Uniqlo needs to expand not just in China but also in the West, where shoppers are increasingly conscious of human rights issues such as forced labour.",

      "Supermarket loyalty cards do offer genuine savings, the UK's competition watchdog has found, but it said people should still shop around.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at 50,000 products on loyalty price promotions across Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Co-op and Waitrose.",
      "It found \"very little evidence\" that supermarkets were inflating their \"usual\" prices to make promotions look like a better deal.",
      "However, it found that despite discounts being legitimate many shoppers still did not trust that the offers were cheaper.",
      "While the CMA also said its review \"has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key\".",
      "\"We know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices,\" said George Lusty, the CMA's interim executive director of consumer protection. \"Which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly.\"",

      "The watchdog also surveyed shoppers and said that nearly 70% of those it spoke to think loyalty pricing offers decent savings.",
      "However, there remains a significant amount of mistrust among consumers towards loyalty promotions.",
      "The CMA said: \"A significant proportion - 40% - say they do not trust loyalty prices are a genuine saving on the usual price.\"",
      "A common view among younger people was that non-member prices in a promotion were higher than normal.",
      "More than 70% of 18 to 29-year-olds thought that the price for those without a loyalty card or app had been bumped up, said the CMA.",
      "While the report examined other supermarkets, it did not draw any conclusions about two of the UK's largest - Asda and Aldi.",
      "Asda has a loyalty points scheme which customers can redeem for vouchers but it does not offer lower prices on a product for those with a loyalty card.",
      "Discounters Aldi and Lidl were not included as they don't sell online, and don't stock a wide enough range of branded products to do a like-for-like comparison, the watchdog said.",
      "Consumer group Which? said two-tier pricing had \"become a common practice across retailers\" so it was \"reassuring\" that people could make genuine savings.",
      "However, it has also studied thousands of products, \"and repeatedly found examples of loyalty price offers that aren't as good as they seem\" according to Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy.",
      "She also said there are concerns that \"millions of consumers are being excluded from accessing lower prices due to loyalty scheme restrictions\" because they have not signed up to a card or app.",
      "Shoppers have been under pressure from the pace of food price rises in recent years, the CMA said.",
      "Although inflation has fallen considerably since then, it said the price of food is still substantially higher relative to how much money people earn.",
      "Customer data",
      "One of the main reasons supermarkets offer loyalty schemes is so they can collect data on customers.",
      "This is very valuable information - studying buying decisions can help supermarkets understand and influence shoppers.",
      "They create highly detailed shopper profiles looking at what people bought and how often.",
      "Some supermarkets sell data to suppliers which can then be used to deliver targeted advertising.",
      "Selling data can be lucrative. Sainsbury's has said it expects Nectar360, the group which manages the supermarket's loyalty scheme, to make an additional \u00a3100m in profit over the next three years.",
      "The CMA said shopper attitudes to data collection range from feeling pressure to trade their personal data for lower prices, to others not feeling concerned.",
      "But only 7% of people surveyed by the watchdog said they hadn't signed up to a loyalty scheme due to privacy concerns.",
      "Annich McIntosh, editor and chief executive of Loyalty Magazine, said there was a question mark over whether it was morally right to force people to participate in loyalty schemes to get price promotions.",
      "But she said these schemes in general benefit shoppers because they can help slow down supermarket price increases.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:18:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president-elect's import taxes may be just talk until he takes office - but they are having an impact anyway.",
    "story": [
      "When handbag designer Sherrill Mosee learned that roughly 2,700 purses and backpacks she had ordered from her Chinese manufacturing partner would not make it onto one ship this autumn, she was initially content to wait.",
      "Then Donald Trump was re-elected as US president.",
      "\"I'm like, okay, we've got to bring those in,\" said Ms Mosee, founder of MinkeeBlue, a small business based in Philadelphia. Her firm is one of the many thousands across the country preparing for the potential impact of Trump's promises to impose stiff new tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Those efforts gained urgency this week as Trump said he would take action on his first day in office. He aimed the measures - a kind of border tax - at China, Mexico and Canada, America's top three trade partners.",
      "Writing on social media, Trump said he planned to impose a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico and \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China.",
      "The post followed his campaign pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of at least 10% on all imports coming into the US, and 60% or more on goods from China - many of which already face steep duties left over from actions taken during his first term as president.",
      "Some experts have said that Trump's policies may ultimately prove less aggressive than promised, and that his statements should be understood as opening salvos in bigger negotiations of migration and drug policy.",
      "But regardless of how policy shakes out, the threats are already having economic consequences, as firms like MinkeeBlue start to stockpile, shift supply chains, re-work contracts and take other steps to guard against the possible impact.",

      "Trump proves he is serious on tariffs - but it's not about trade",
      "Could Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "Chris Caton, managing director for global strategy and analytics at warehouse giant Prologis, said his firm had already seen an uptick in activity \"on the margin\" as businesses respond to possible tariffs by looking for space to stock up.",
      "\"There's economic impact whether it's bluster or not,\" said economist Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "In the days after the election, footwear giant Steve Madden told investors that it was moving forward with plans to shift manufacturing outside of China, with the aim of cutting its imports from the country in half over the next year.",
      "Tool and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker also said it had initiated conversations with its customers about price hikes tied to the tariffs.",
      "Executives at retail giants such as Walmart have discussed similar plans.",
      "Even if Trump's policies remain just talk, Ms Edelberg said the public could see higher prices, as well as possible shortages of some items, as hoarding left some firms scrambling.",
      "Just the simple fact that firms were unsure about what was going to happen was also likely to reduce economic growth in the months ahead, she added.",
      "\"Even if firms don't think that these tariffs are going to happen with 100% certainty, it's not zero, so they should be responding,\" Ms Edelberg said.",
      "Trump and his advisers have argued that tariffs will help revive US manufacturing and drive a new US jobs boom.",
      "But that can come at a cost, businesses owners and economists warn.",
      "Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Canadian solar panel maker Heliene, said his firm was nearly wiped out in 2018 when Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made solar panels and it had to absorb the fees.",
      "The firm now does all of its manufacturing in the US, where it employs 400 people. Many of its suppliers have also set up shop in the US, lured by government incentives for renewable energy introduced by President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Pochtaruk's firm has learned from its experience, changing the design of its contracts so that customers are responsible for unexpected cost changes - whether due to tariffs or the kind of price spikes that hit during the pandemic.",
      "But despite these protections, the possibility of renewed trade tension between countries as closely connected as Canada and the US was worrying, Mr Pochtaruk said.",
      "Some key materials - such as glass - still come from overseas and face likely price hikes. The new administration could also bring other policies that slow growth in the industry.",
      "\"We are talking to all of our clients,\" Mr Pochtaruk said. \"There is a lot of anxiety.\"",
      "Economists say the evidence from existing tariffs - which have been present for decades in sectors such as clothing and footwear - suggests that while they can protect some firms, the cost is high and they do little to boost overall employment, while raising prices for US companies and consumers.",
      "The National Retail Federation (NRF) has warned that tariffs along the lines of Trump's campaign proposals would cost US consumers between $46bn (\u00a336.6bn) and $78bn more annually for apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.",
      "By NRF estimates, a $40 toaster, for example, would rise in price to $48-$52, while a $50 pair of athletic shoes could jump to $59-$64.",
      "Trump's move on Monday to target Mexico - a key supplier of grocery staples such as fruits and vegetables and historically protected by a free-trade agreement - underscores the tension between his tariff promises and other pledges on the campaign trail to bring down prices for Americans.",
      "Viktor Shvets of Macquarie Capital said that although Trump's ideas were in conflict with each other, he believed in the end Trump's fear of disrupting financial markets would limit his trade actions.",
      "\"Risks are high, but we remain convinced that 'guardrails' are sufficiently robust to avoid the worst outcomes,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.",
      "Such bets are little comfort to small business owners like Ms Mosee, who have little extra financial cushion to weather uncertainty.",
      "As a small brand facing significant competition, Ms Mosee said she was not in a strong position to raise prices on her bags, which typically sell for about $180 a piece.",
      "She has been looking in Cambodia and India for a new supplier.",
      "But after a decade on her own, Ms Mosee - a former engineer who has decorated her office with motivational posters promising that \"something wonderful is about to happen\" - said she probably needed to find a business partner if her business, with its two employees, was to survive the expected changes ahead.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 21:29:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Motor giant Stellantis says it is closing the van making plant in the context of the UK's rules on electric vehicle sales.",
    "story": [
      "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.",
      "Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.",
      "Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.",
      "There are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand.",
      "Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended.",
      "\"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\".",
      "Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\".",
      "The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",
      "It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high.",
      "However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.",
      "As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year.",
      "Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can.",
      "But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.",
      "Electric car targets could be eased as demand flags",
      "Car firms demand more help to meet 2030 petrol ban",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",
      "Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary.",
      "Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection.",
      "Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans.",
      "Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France",
      "The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation.",
      "It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton.",
      "But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\".",
      "\u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said.",
      "Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932.",
      "At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued.",
      "Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.",
      "'Major concern'",
      "Nissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\".",
      "Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs.",
      "The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable.",
      "Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\".",
      "The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\".",
      "The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\"."

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president-elect is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam.",
    "story": [
      "Is Donald Trump serious about tariffs? This has been the question hanging over not just world markets but the whole world of economics.",
      "The popular wisdom had become that he wasn\u2019t really that serious, and the key bit of evidence for that was his nomination of hedge fund investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary, someone seen as a moderate when it came to tariffs compared with others whose names were floated for the role.",
      "The answer overnight, though, was pretty brutal. Yes, he is serious, and in the most unexpected way. By choosing to target Mexico and Canada as well as China, he is confirming threats made on the campaign trail that appeared the most fanciful.",
      "For starters he is willing to blow up the Mexico-Canada-America trade deal that he signed in his first term on day one of his second term.",
      "What does a Trump free trade deal even mean now, if the new White House is willing to put tariffs on your country anyway?",
      "And importantly, the rationale for these moves is not mainly or even much about trade or economic policy. These tariffs are about getting Mexico, Canada and China to alter their policies on crackdowns over migration and illicit drugs.",
      "Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, on topics entirely unrelated to global trade.",
      "Are the leaders of G20 nations with their own domestic audiences really going to roll over in order to give the new president a win?",
      "They could choose to wait out the inevitable impact of Trump applying a 25% increase on the cost of two-fifths of US imports on US consumers and inflation.",
      "Trump vows tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on day one",
      "Would Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "The cost of washing machines in the US rose 12% or by about $86, after Trump hit foreign-made machines with a 50% tariff during his first term. Such increases, no matter how modest, run counter to Trump's promises during the campaign to bring down the cost of living.",
      "But though Americans might be more sensitive to price rises now than they were in 2018, the political appetite for tariffs should not be underestimated.",
      "Joe Biden criticised the tariffs Trump put in place on Chinese imports during his first term. But once in office himself, President Biden left the measures in place, even expanding them in targeted ways.",
      "What is also clear is that Trump's selection of Bessent as Treasury Secretary will not temper the tariff push.",
      "Amid the battle for his nomination he went out of his way to acknowledge the power of tariffs as a tool that had been pioneered by Alexander Hamilton himself, the first ever US Treasury Secretary.",
      "But earlier this year he had also suggested that while tariffs might be used tactically, the main tool for the US rejuvenation of manufacturing would be a cheaper dollar.",
      "Europe and the UK have been spared for now. But it is important to reiterate that these moves are not even the real bulk of the tariff policy outlined by Trump.",
      "He wants to fundamentally change the global economic map, and reduce China and Europe\u2019s trade surplus with the US, which he views as \u201cripping off America\u201d.",
      "The world is far more complicated now, however, than these binary economic relationships. The US is undoubtedly powerful enough to start rebalancing world trade.",
      "Push things too far though, especially with G7 and G20 allies, and the US might find itself rather too isolated."

      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",
      "UWI hopes to introduce other sargassum-based innovations too, such as pest control products.",
      "Ms Spencer says it\u2019s been \"heart-warming\u201d to witness the results of the team\u2019s research.",
      "\u201cJust seeing the actual potential is motivating me to keep working,\u201d she adds.",
      "As for Brittney, five years after her eureka moment, she says she\u2019s still \u201cpinching\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cTo see the car in action was mind-blowing,\u201d she grins. \u201cI would encourage all young scientists to press ahead with their ideas. You never know when you might make the next big discovery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of work, plenty of grit and pushing against walls to reach this point,\u201d Dr Henry concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of UWI innovation and is exportable to the wider world, because it\u2019s not just the Caribbean that\u2019s affected; sargassum also impacts parts of West Africa, South America and Florida.",

    "summary": "The iconic carmaker's rebrand has certainly caught people's attention, but will it pay off?",
    "story": [
      "Jaguar has urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the carmaker.",
      "The company, embarking on the biggest change in its 102-year old history, released a new logo and a so-called \"social media tease\" this week, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in early December.",
      "The teaser video has faced backlash, with many critics pointing to the fact it doesn't feature an actual car. Others have praised the company for being bold and shaking things up.",
      "Either way, the rebrand has grabbed people's attention and Jaguar has since admitted it not only expected such debate - but it wanted it.",
      "In the 1960s, Jaguar launched the E-Type and XJ which have come to be known among some of the most iconic cars of all time.",
      "Now the company is trying to do the same again by unveiling its new \"design vision\" in Miami next month.",
      "Teasing the vision online, the 30 second advert features models in extravagant, brightly-coloured outfits who reveal the new company logo written as JaGUar.",
      "No cars, no suave men in suits, no big cats.",
      "\"Do you sell cars?\" was the response on X, from owner Elon Musk, who is also the boss of electric car firm Tesla.",
      "\"This is surely a joke?\" added one user, while another suggested the move would \"cost jobs and do real damage\". Some said \"Go woke, go broke\".",
      "Specsavers, known for its humorous social media manner, created a mock-up of its own logo in response, which looked like it had been created on Microsoft Paint.",
      "While supermarket Aldi chipped in at Jaguar's \"Copy Nothing\" slogan with: \"You sound like our legal team.\"",
      "Amid the anger and sarcasm, Jaguar has doubled down on its decision, replying to some posts with phrases such as \"To live is to evolve\".",
      "\"We had to break rules and do something that would get us cut thru,\" a spokesman told the BBC - suggesting this is all part of the plan.",
      "As Martin Brundle, the former Formula 1 racing driver turned broadcaster, put it:  \"I have no idea what this is all about, but it\u2019s genius.",
      "\"Everyone is talking about Jaguar in a moment of time when they\u2019re not actually making cars.\"",
      "'Maybe Jaguar wanted this response'",
      "Lee Rolston is the chief growth officer of global branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and has worked on rebrands of household names such as Burger King and the RSPCA.",
      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response,\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",

      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",

      "This is not the first attempt globally to limit children's social media use, but it involves the highest age limit set by any country, and does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.",
      "\"This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood,\" Albanese said when introducing the bill to the lower house last week. \"We want parents to have peace of mind.\"",

      "\"We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media\u2026 but we need to be involved in developing solutions,\" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator.",

      "Broadcaster Kirsty Wark, who was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011, said he told \"sexualised\" jokes during filming.",
      "Wallace's lawyers say it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. Masterchef's production company Banijay UK has launched an investigation and said Wallace is co-operating.",
      "Wark, who is best known for hosting BBC Newsnight, told BBC News that on two occasions, during early morning filming, Wallace told stories and jokes of a \"sexualised nature\" in front of contestants and crew.",
      "She said she feels strongly that the comments were \"really, really in the wrong place\".",
      "Other allegations we\u2019ve heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "'Unacceptable and unprofessional'",
      "We have also found that Wallace was warned by the BBC after a complaint was raised about him in 2018 about the show Impossible Celebrities.",
      "A formal HR investigation took place and, in the outcome letter, which we have seen, the BBC concluded that \"many aspects of [Wallace's] behaviour were both unacceptable and unprofessional\".",
      "In a subsequent letter, which we have also seen, a BBC executive said she had held a 90-minute meeting with Wallace to make clear \"how seriously the BBC takes this matter\". She also reassured the workers that action would be taken \"to prevent a similar reoccurrence and to safeguard others in the future\".",
      "But further incidents have since emerged.",

      "\"We are always clear that any behaviour which falls below the standards expected by the BBC will not be tolerated.",

    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",

      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",

    "summary": "The film sequel is called an \"animated triumph\" but also \"a vacuum-packed slice of digital IP content\".",
    "story": [
      "The sequel to animated Disney musical Moana has been broadly described by film critics as good - but not as good as the 2016 original.",
      "The Telegraph awarded four stars to the follow-up, which it called a \"giddily animated triumph\".",
      "Empire gave the same rating, saying the new film is \"a touch less fresh than the original\", but is \"still bursting with energy, emotion, warmth and imagination\".",
      "However, the Guardian awarded two stars to Moana 2, saying \"this frictionless sequel lacks genuine passion\".",
      "The newspaper's critic Peter Bradshaw described it as \"a vacuum-packed slice of digital IP content, a perky ChatGPT iteration of love, laughter and belonging\".",
      "\"It is all inoffensive enough, but weirdly lacking in anything genuinely passionate or heartfelt, all managed with frictionless smoothness and algorithmic efficiency,\" he wrote.",
      "The original story of an adventurous Polynesian girl who sets sail on a mission to save her people was a box office hit eight years ago.",
      "Moana 2 reunites its titular star, voiced by Auli\u2019i Cravalho, and Dwayne Johnson's demigod Maui, on a new voyage to save other islanders oppressed by the evil god Nalo.",
      "They are joined by a crew of \"unlikely seafarers\", as Disney put it - namely the wide-eyed Moni (Hual\u0101lai Chung), brat Loto (Rose Matafeo) and grumpy farmer Kele (David Fane).",
      "'Above average'",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman summed up the film as a \"more dutiful than inspired sequel which turns into a catchy action fairy tale\".",
      "\"Moana doesn't have much inner journey left, but the movie has vibrant monsters and a flow of movement that keeps your eyeballs dancing,\" he wrote.",
      "He noted how the new songs \"lack that Lin-Manuel Miranda magic\" that was present in the orginal on memorable tracks like How Far I\u2019ll Go and You\u2019re Welcome.",
      "\"Moana 2 is an okay movie, an above-average kiddie roller-coaster, and a piece of pure product in a way that the first Moana at its best, transcended,\" he concluded.",
      "\"The new movie wears you down to win you over; it\u2019s a just efficient enough delivery system for follow-your-dreams inspiration to be a major holiday hit.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was more positive about the \"exhilarating, romping sequel with songs that put Wicked to shame\".",
      "He added: \"Moana 2 exhilarates with its tunefulness, and absolutely romps along from the moment the heroine gets off the island, bound for another adventure on her trusty outrigger canoe.\"",
      "The earworms in the soundtrack \"cluster neatly around entwined themes: spreading your wings versus the tug of homesickness; finding your path but daring also to lose it\", he wrote.",
      "However, the Radio Times said the \"colourful Disney sequel lacks emotional impact\".",
      "\"The follow-up will appeal to the youngest of fans, but parents may find themselves less invested,\" wrote James Mottram, awarding three stars.",
      "Screen Daily's Tim Grierson declared that the movie was \"not as bold as its heroine\".",
      "\"What once seemed so effortlessly charming about this young wayfinder forging her own path has, in Part Two, become more convoluted and stilted - it\u2019s a journey that, frustratingly, leads nowhere.\"",
      "BBC Culture reviewer Nicholas Barber said the sequel was a \"solid\" effort given that number one was \"a hard act to follow\".",
      "He branded number two as a \"hurtling Disneyland rollercoaster ride\" that lacks the joy and refreshing originality of its predecessor.",
      "\"It comes across as several episodes glued together, each one more outlandish than the last.\"",
      "A Moana sequel was initially mooted as a Disney+ series, but taking it to cinemas instead has now set up a box office battle with the first Wicked film, which has just been released.",
      "Wicked, which stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, earned $114m (\u00a390.6m) on its opening weekend in North America.",
      "Moana 2 is expected to make big waves at the box office, too, aiming to for between $135m and $145m (\u00a3107m-\u00a3115m) this weekend, according to Variety.",
      "For Sunday's UK premiere, London's Leicester Square was transformed into a Polynesian island, complete with palm trees, a beach and dancers.",
      "Johnson told cinemagoers they should feel free to sing. \"Especially if you love music, that's the fun part,\" the US star, aka the Rock, told BBC News.",
      "Recently, there has been a debate on social media around whether people should sing along in cinemas, sparked by the release of Wicked.",

      "Drake and Kendrick Lamar's feud explained",

      "Instead, it is a \"pre-action petition\", under which Drake\u2019s lawyers can ask the court to order Universal to preserve any relevant documents and information ahead of future legal action.",
      "It was filed in Texas and also involves the radio giant iHeartRadio, which operates more than 850 stations across the US.",
      "According to Drake's lawyers, Not Like Us was \"heard more than 25 million times\" by listeners to iHeart stations in the four months after its release.",

      "Drake's lawyers admit that they have been \"unable to confirm\" whether the payments went to iHeart stations, but argue that \"as the number one audio company in the country\", it was the most likely recipient.",
      "If approved, the court action would compel the companies to provide any evidence regarding the accusations.",
      "The BBC has contacted iHeartRadio for a response to the petition.",
      "As in his previous filing, Drake goes on to accuse Universal of using \"bots\" to falsely inflate Lamar's streaming numbers, and of paying influencers to promote Not Like Us online - all of which the company has denied.",
      "But the latest documents add detail about Drake\u2019s grievances toward Universal, the label where he has spent his entire career.",
      "The documents claim the company knew that Lamar\u2019s song \"falsely\" accused him of being a \"certified paedophile\", a \"predator\" and someone whose name should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\", but chose to release it anyway.",
      "The song was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between the two rappers, who had been trading barbs in their songs since the early 2010s.",
      "Debuting at number one on the US chart, it has also been nominated for four Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, in which he denied accusations of sexual misconduct and claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, the musician later deleted the track from his Instagram feed.",
      "The Canadian star, who is one of the most-streamed musicians of all time, releases music through his own label, OVO Music, but licenses the songs to Universal's subsidiary label Republic for marketing and distribution.",
      "Lamar has a similar deal, licensing his records through Universal's Interscope imprint."

      "These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded).",
      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",
      "Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why."

    "story": [
      "The hits of Scotland's biggest boyband are to be turned into a new musical to mark the 50th anniversary of their first number one hit next year.",
      "The Bay City Rollers took the world by storm in the mid-70s, trimmed in tartan and causing scenes of hysteria wherever they went.",
      "Now, the fans who followed them obsessively and screamed their loyalty to the cheeky Scots, are to appear centre-stage in Rollers Forever.",
      "The new show will feature the band's biggest hits, including Bye Bye Baby, Keep On Dancing, Shang-a-Lang and Summer Love Sensation.",
      "The show will follow the story of two Bay City Rollers superfans, who meet up for a Saturday night and relive their teenage years following their idols.",
      "Sprinkling some tartan stardust on the project is original Roller Stuart \u201cWoody\u201d Wood, who is serving as artistic consultant.",
      "Woody joined the band at the age of 17 in 1974, just before their success exploded with the hit Shang-a-lang.",
      "He said the great thing about the musical was that it was about the fans, who - like the band - have been around for 50 years.",
      "\"Thank god for the fans. They've kept it alive all these years,\" he said.",
      "\"I cant wait to be in the audience and watch them react to it. I think they\u2019ll have their tartan out \u2013 their scarves and probably dress up for the occasion.\"",
      "Remembering their thousands of fans screaming and trying to tear the band members to bits, Woody said it all descended into a \"mass of crazy\".",
      "Although they had great fun at the time, Woody said being a teenage sensation was not for the faint hearted.",
      "He said he would not be able to handle it all now and, at the age of 67, would rather stay at home.",
      "The play is written by award-winning playwright Danny McCahon and directed by acclaimed theatre director Liz Carruthers.",
      "Also involved is current \"Roller\" John McLaughlin.",

      "\"It's like getting to play for your favourite football team,\" he said.",
      "John said the Rollers fans were unique and became so identifiable because of their tartan-clad outfits.",
      "\"It's like an army\", he says.",
      "\"Even today, they turn up to gigs with tartan scarves, all happy, all joyous.\"",
      "He says fans will be able to have a great night out at the show by celebrating the band and their songs.",

      "Every moment is accompanied by a hit from the Bay City Rollers.",
      "From the first time they see the band on TV to a rousing dance in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, the lives, loves and emotions of the women are governed by the Rollers.",

      "The musical sets out to be a celebration of the music and legacy of the \"tartan teens\" who wore the look once described as \"young love personified\".",
      "One of those real-life tartan teenagers was Gail Shackley from Manchester.",
      "Gail said she had been a \"die-hard fan\" since Bye Bye Baby was number one in March 1975.",
      "Being from Manchester, she said the Edinburgh band were like \u201cthe boys next door\u201d.",
      "So, loving the band became easy because they were easily accessible to UK fans.",
      "\u201cThey were ours, you latch onto your own,\u201d she said.",

      "She said she was shocked to have remembered every word to every song.",
      "\u201cIt was like riding a bike, you never forget,\u201d she said.",
      "Gail met Les McKeown, the original frontman of the band, at an intimate gig of his band Egotrip in 1997.",
      "She fondly remembers how her \u201cteenage heartthrob\u201d had brought out food and drinks to the 20 or so fans at the gig.",
      "\"After that, I was back on the scene like I'd never been off it,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "Forty years on, the Band Aid song continues to generate debate about the way it presents Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "\"Festival prices and ticket prices have gone up drastically, but the musicians' wage hasn't,\" she said.",

      "\"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says.",
      "And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point.",
      "\"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says.",
      "\"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"",
      "'Not a democracy'",
      "Interscope released her two days later. But instead of the world ending, Gigi's energy  renewed. She wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching YouTube tutorials.",
      "Sailor Song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this February.",
      "\"I was on my bed, my door was open and I was just messing around, jamming,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\"",
      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",
      "Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long.",
      "In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\"",
      "Gigi's response, posted to TikTok, was uncompromising.",
      "\"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"",
      "The singer's struggles with faith run deep.",
      "Her parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida.",
      "The experience was not all positive.",
      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",

    "summary": "Around two million asthma and COPD attacks each year could be treated with the drug, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers say they have found the first new treatment for asthma attacks in 50 years.",
      "The injection dampens part of the immune system that can go into overdrive in flare-ups of both asthma and a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
      "Benralizumab is already used in the most severe cases, but the latest research suggests it could be used routinely for around two million attacks in the UK each year.",
      "The research team at King's College London said the drug was a \"game-changer\" that could \"revolutionise\" care.",
      "The findings stem from the realisation that not all asthma or COPD attacks are the same. Instead, different parts of the immune system are over-reacting in different patients.",
      "\"Now we can see there are different patterns of inflammation, we can be smarter and get the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time,\" said Prof Mona Bafadhel, from King's.",
      "Benralizumab targets a type of white blood cell - called an eosinophil - that can cause inflammation and damage in the lungs.",
      "Eosinophils are implicated in about half of asthma attacks and a third of COPD flare-ups.",
      "If such an attack - involving difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness - cannot be controlled with regular inhalers then doctors currently prescribe a course of steroids.",
      "The study, on 158 people, monitored patients for three months after treatment for a flare-up.",
      "The results in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine found a treatment failure rate of:",
      "74% when taking steroidsand 45% with the new therapy",
      "74% when taking steroids",
      "and 45% with the new therapy",
      "People treated with the new therapy were less likely to be admitted to hospital, need another round of treatment or die.",
      "Prof Bafadhel said this could benefit a huge number of people as two million attacks a year \"is not a small number\".",
      "\"This is a game-changer, we\u2019ve not had a change in treatment for 50 years - it will revolutionise how we treat people when they\u2019re really unwell,\" Prof Bafadhel said.",
      "Volunteers also reported improved symptoms and a better quality of life on the new drug.",
      "Alison Spooner, who is 55 and from Oxfordshire, was one of those taking part in the trial. She has had asthma since childhood, but it became worse over the past five years and she's had three major attacks.",
      "\"They seemed to be getting worse, the severe lack of breath was quite frightening when you're gasping and there's nothing to gasp at,\" she told me.",
      "Alison says she felt \"drastically different\" after having the injection and still uses her inhalers but \"only because I've been told to\".",
      "\"Unfortunately, no drug gets rid of asthma completely, but this is the nearest thing. It's a bit of a miracle actually,\" she adds.",
      "'Massive promise'",
      "Benralizumab is not ready for widescale use.",
      "It will still take a larger trial, due to start in 2025 and which will last two years, to be certain of any benefit. Anybody who is already given these drugs should continue to follow their prescription.",
      "That study will also have to assess cost-effectiveness since monoclonal antibodies, like this therapy, are expensive drugs.",
      "But Dr Sanjay Ramakrishnan, from the University of Oxford, said the work so far \"shows massive promise\" and that treatment for COPD was \"stuck in the 20th Century\" despite being one of the leading causes of death worldwide.",
      "Long-term use of steroids is linked with side-effects including weight gain, diabetes and weak bones.",
      "Geoffrey Pointing, 77, from Oxfordshire, who also took part in the trial, said: \"I didn't get any side effects like I used to with the steroid tablets.",
      "\"I used to never sleep well the first night of taking steroids, but the first day on the study, I could sleep that first night, and I was able to carry on with my life without problems.\"",
      "It is estimated that four people with asthma and 85 people with COPD die in the UK every day.",
      "Dr Samantha Walker, from the charity Asthma + Lung UK, said the results were \"great news\".",

It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",

      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:44:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Judges will consider a legal challenge which could affect how women and trans people are treated.",
    "story": [
      "Judges at the Supreme Court are considering how women are defined in law in a landmark case brought by Scottish campaigners.",
      "It is the culmination of a long-running legal dispute which started with a relatively niche piece of legislation at the Scottish Parliament, but which could have big UK-wide implications.",
      "It will set out exactly how the law is meant to treat trans people, and what it really means to go through the gender recognition process.",
      "And it could have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, and how measures aimed at tackling discrimination will operate in future",
      "What will this case decide?",
      "The case started on Tuesday, with judges hearing from lawyers acting on behalf of the For Women Scotland campaign group, which is concerned about the potential impact of trans rights on women's rights.",
      "The Scottish government's legal representatives will address the court on Wednesday, before the judges retire to consider their ruling - which could take several weeks.",
      "At the most basic level, the case centres on what \u201csex\u201d actually means in law.",
      "Is it about biology and chromosomes set at birth, or does it tie in ideas of gender identity and the gender recognition process?",
      "The Gender Recognition Act of 2004 established the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate - something it states amounts to a change of sex \u201cfor all purposes\u201d.",
      "When someone gets a gender recognition certificate, \"if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person's sex becomes that of a man, and if it is the female gender, the person's sex becomes that of a woman\".",
      "Then the Equality Act of 2010 came along to set out legal protections against discrimination for specific groups - with \u201csex\u201d, \"sexual orientation\" and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d included as protected characteristics.",
      "It simply defines a woman as \"a female of any age\".",
      "There has been much dispute about how these two pieces of legislation sit together.",
      "When the Equality Act talks about \u201csex\u201d, does it mean biological sex - or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the GRA?",
      "This case won\u2019t change the letter of the law, but a ruling on how it should be interpreted could have big implications for how all kinds of public bodies and services operate, and whether others might be open to legal challenges.",
      "There has been particular controversy in light of the debate about whether the gender recognition process should be streamlined - there was a lengthy wrangle at Holyrood over \u201cself-identification\u201d reforms.",
      "Those were ultimately blocked by the UK government, which claimed they would have a \"significant impact\" on the Equality Act.",
      "But it plays into a number of other rows, with Scotland\u2019s Rape Crisis network currently in turmoil about how its centres define women and provide single-sex spaces.",
      "Public bodies have expressed frustration about a lack of clarity around interpretation of the law, having been left to work out policy on their own.",
      "Police Scotland - which has faced questions over how it treats transgender people - has criticised an \u201cabsence of direction\u201d from politicians in Edinburgh and London over how to reconcile the gender recognition process with the Equality Act.",
      "With political leaders increasingly wary of the topic and the fierce debates which go along with it, it has ultimately fallen to the courts to adjudicate.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "MSPs at Holyrood passed the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act in 2018, with the aim of getting more women onto public sector boards.",
      "That law\u2019s definition of \u201cwoman\u201d included people who were \u201cliving as a woman\u201d and were currently or proposing to undergo the gender reassignment process.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland challenged this in court, and after a series of appeals they eventually prevailed.",
      "Judges ruled that the definition used \u201cconflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics\u201d laid out in the Equality Act - a reserved piece of legislation which MSPs do not have the power to alter.",
      "The Scottish government had to amend the bill to remove the definition.",
      "But at the same time they issued new guidance alongside the legislation, stating that it would include women as defined by the Equality Act - and also the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), to the effect that a full gender recognition certificate could be taken as a declaration of someone\u2019s sex \u201cfor all purposes\u201d.",
      "For Women Scotland challenged this guidance in a fresh judicial review, which ended in defeat.",
      "Judge Lady Haldane ruled in December 2022 that the definition of sex was \u201cnot limited to biological or birth sex\u201d, but included those in possession of a gender recognition certificate.",
      "That ruling is what For Women Scotland are challenging at the Supreme Court.",
      "They have already lost one appeal in the Scottish courts, but judges in Edinburgh agreed to push the case straight to the Supreme Court in London for a definitive ruling.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "The issue being considered by the court is whether \u201ca person with a full gender recognition certificate - which recognises their gender is female - is a \u2018woman\u2019 for the purposes of the Equality Act\u201d.",
      "Aidan O'Neill KC, representing For Women Scotland, described that premise as a \"legal fiction\".",
      "He argued for the \"common sense\" meaning of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "The KC said that definition of sex was necessary to protect the rights of women.",
      "For Women Scotland argue the Equality Act supersedes the GRA thanks to a subsection of the 2004 Act which nods to it being subject to \"provision made by \u2026 any other enactment\".",
      "Mr O'Neill denied that For Women Scotland's case was \"transphobic\", arguing that it could never have been parliament\u2019s intention for equality law to have \u201cabsurd or nonsensical outcomes\u201d.",
      "He gave the example of a heterosexual man getting a full GRC. He said they would in theory become a same-sex attracted woman. The court heard this could leave lesbian associations with \"no choice but to admit natal men into their ranks\".",
      "The lawyer said this and several other examples he gave were evidence of the patriarchy in action. He said the court should not \u201ccapitulate\u201d to the patriarchy, urging judges to \"confront\" it.",
      "He raised the issue of women-only spaces such as hospital wards, refuges and prisons and said admissions could be decided only by the \u201cpaperwork\u201d of a GRC.",
      "The Scottish government meanwhile essentially argues that the two pieces of legislation are clear in their language, and that MPs knew what they were doing when they passed them.",
      "Ruth Crawford KC, representing the Scottish government, told the court there is \"no express measure\" made in the Equality Act to affect the GRA's wording that a certificate changes someone's sex, \"nor is it implied by the purpose of the act\u201d.",
      "She said the GRA makes clear a full gender certificate applies \"for all purposes\".",
      "The lawyer argued the GRA ensured \"a person who has become the sex of their acquired gender is entitled to the protections of that sex\", including protection against unfavourable treatment as an individual or a group.",
      "Ms Crawford said someone who had acquired status as a women using a GRC belonged to their acquired sex and was entitled to its protections under the Equality Act as much as those who were women at birth.",
      "She also said a woman who got a GRC to become a man no longer belonged to their previous sex, and would lose protections offered under the Equality Act.",
      "She countered claims from Mr O'Neill that a gender certificate was a \"legal fiction\" or of merely symbolic value.",
      "She described it as a \"fundamental right\" similar to adoption, telling the court a GRC affected an individual's relationship with the state, and with private organisations such as employers.",
      "Five judges will hear their arguments - headed by the court's president, Lord Reed - and will retire to consider them before issuing a judgement at a later date.",
      "What could the implications be?",
      "This issue has become so emotive because people on both sides see it as a threat to their very identity.",
      "The most recent census found there were 19,990 people in Scotland who were trans, or had a trans history - under 0.5% of the adult population.",
      "The figure for England and Wales is also around 0.5% - 262,000 people told the last census that their gender identity and birth sex were different.",
      "There is uncertainty around the true figures, with census returns thought to be overestimated - but what we know for sure is that 1,088 full gender recognition certificates were granted across the UK in 2023-24, up from 867 the previous year.",
      "The figure has been rising since application costs were cut - and in the context of this case, it is people with full GRCs who are central.",
      "Beyond this, equalities groups stress that there are a great many minority groups which are protected by the Equality Act, and see this case as potentially being the \"thin end of the wedge\" which could undermine their rights.",
      "For trans people, they say it could erode the protections against discrimination they have under their reassigned gender.",
      "If someone has a gender recognition certificate attesting that they are a woman, are they entitled to protection from sex discrimination under the Equality Act? Could they make an equal pay claim as a woman?",
      "The UK\u2019s first trans judge - who unsuccessfully applied to intervene in this case - is said to have pursued a pensions claim along those very lines against the Ministry of Justice.",
      "Meanwhile women\u2019s groups also say the ruling will have an impact on a large group - literally half of the population.",
      "They say it could affect the running of single-sex services and spaces. Things like support groups for victims of sexual abuse can only legally justify excluding men due to the Equality Act\u2019s protections.",
      "Campaigners say everything from hospital wards to refuges and sports events might have to change policy or find themselves open to legal challenges based on the court's ruling.",
      "Lesbian groups - protected under \"sexual orientation\" in the 2010 Act - also say it could affect their ability to have exclusive clubs.",
      "There could also be political implications.",
      "Some groups see the case as a reason to clarify the actual wording of the law, by having MPs amend the Equality Act itself.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - the national equalities regulator, which is intervening in the case - has called for this.",
      "They say that MPs did intend to include those with a gender recognition certificate as having changed their sex when they passed the Act in 2010, but that they may not have appreciated consequences which \"jeopardise the rights and interests of women and same-sex attracted people\".",
      "They say this is a \"wholly unsatisfactory situation, which parliament should address with urgency\".",
      "But some other equalities groups oppose \"reopening\" the Equality Act, seeing it as a move which could see the rights of protected groups watered down.",
      "And it's not clear that there is the political will for governments to wade into this topic.",
      "The Scottish government previously tried to take the lead, when Nicola Sturgeon led the charge with self-identification reforms.",
      "But her successors as first minister have backed away from these issues, with current first minister John Swinney pushing plans for a ban on conversion therapy onto the UK government's desk by calling for a four-nation approach.",
      "At a UK level, rewriting the Equality Act was a Conservative pledge during the election campaign - and not one which Sir Keir Starmer matched.",
      "Indeed Labour's manifesto promised to \"simplify and reform\" the gender recognition process, removing \"indignities\".",
      "As well as affecting the interpretation of the law as it stands, the ruling in this case could reignite calls for reform in parliament itself."

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:46:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour\u2019s cabinet remains divided on how to vote on Friday\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill has been defended by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall who told the BBC it was about the \"right to choose\".",
      "She refused to criticise Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who wrote to her constituents this weekend saying the proposed changes would create a \u201cslippery slope to death on demand\u201d.",
      "Kendall told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg she believed the bill would give people \"power, choice and control\" over their own deaths.",
      "The bill, which would allow some terminally ill people to have a medically assisted death, is to be debated by MPs on Friday.",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally ill people on assisted dying",
      "No pressure on MPs over assisted dying vote, says PM",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Kendall said: \"I think you should have the right to choose.",
      "\"The point is not that this is for everybody.\"",
      "Kendall, who is a long-time advocate of assisted dying, called the debate on the bill part of a \u201cbigger\u201d national discussion as more people \"have longer deaths\".",
      "Her comments came as 29 faith leaders representing Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Sikhs signed an open letter warning the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, would lead to people being pressured into ending their lives to avoid burdening families or the NHS.",
      "MPs will get a free vote on Friday on the bill - introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - meaning they can follow their conscience rather than party orders.",
      "Public opinion shows a majority support of changing the law, with the latest YouGov poll, showing 73% of Britons support allowing assisted dying in principle.",
      "Campaigning for both sides continues in the run-up to Friday's vote, which will be the first public expression of MPs' support.",
      "Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme he wanted to see more debate on the issues.",
      "\"People want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge,\" he said.",
      "Brown is a longstanding critic of assisted dying and urged MPs to vote against changes saying: \"I see life as a gift - I see it as something to be valued.\"",
      "Mahmood joined Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson who have already said that they would vote against the bill.",
      "Care Minister Stephen Kinnock expressed his support for the bill, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer backed assisted dying proposals the last time they were debated by MPs in 2015. This time round he has said he will not pressurise Labour MPs either way.",
      "Campaigners supporting the bill, including broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, argue terminally ill people should get a choice over how they die to avoid unnecessary suffering.",
      "Dame Esther, who revealed last year she had joined Dignitas after a terminal cancer diagnosis, described the new bill as \u201cwonderful\u201d.",
      "In her letter, Mahmood said the most significant risk of introducing assisted dying is \"the pressure the elderly, vulnerable, sick or disabled may place upon themselves\" to end their lives sooner.",
      "She said she was \"profoundly concerned\" by the legislation, not just for religious reasons but because it could create a \"slippery slope towards death on demand\" and argued the government must \u201cprotect and preserve life, not take it away\u201d.",
      "Mahmood added that scandals like Hillsborough, infected blood and the Post Office Horizon \"reminded us that the state and those acting on its behalf are not always benign\".",
      "Speaking to Sky News, Leadbeater said she had no doubts \"whatsoever\" her proposed bill was the right thing to do.",
      "Current laws are \"failing\" causing families to lose loved ones in \"harrowing circumstances\" and leaving people to endure \"painful deaths\", she said.",
      "\"By creating a legal framework, we will improve the situation,\" she added.",
      "The divide on the assisted dying bill has not split neatly down party lines. Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake told the BBC he plans to back the bill.",
      "Hollinrake argued he and others \"would like that choice\" at the end of their lives and he did not \"think it\u2019s right for the state to prevent them\".",
      "While acknowledging other ministers concerns, he said he trusted Parliament to keep checks in place to protect the system.",
      "Veteran broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby rejected fears of a \"slippery slope\" on assisted dying, citing Oregon in the US - which introduced similar laws 27 years ago without expanding them further.",
      "Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg panel, Dimbleby said he backed the bill and had been influenced by the experience of his brother Nicholas who died of motor neurone disease.",
      "However former culture secretary Nadine Dorries said she was against the bill and called for more palliative care.",
      "She said she was \"forever grateful\" her late husband had changed his mind about taking his own life after a terminal bowl cancer diagnosis, allowing him to have \"the best four months\" with his family before dying.",
      "Broadcaster Piers Morgan meanwhile told the panel he felt conflicted but urged for more hospice funding to ensure peaceful deaths for the terminally ill."

      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",

      "She met ministers from the federal government in Baghdad and regional leaders in Kurdistan in the north where many smuggling gangs are based.",
      "The agreement will involve greater intelligence sharing and more joint law enforcement operations, all designed to increase the number of smugglers that are prosecuted.",
      "As part of the deal, the UK will give Iraqi law enforcement \u00a3300,000 for training in border security, focused on organised immigration crime and drug trafficking. On top of this, the authorities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq will get support worth \u00a3200,000 to help tighten their border security and tackle irregular migration.",

      "The BBC team were the only broadcast journalists travelling with Cooper. The focus in Baghdad was a half-day meeting with her Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Amir al-Shammari.",
      "They met at the interior ministry before visiting the Iraqi human trafficking centre.",

      "The agreement is the first substantive attempt by the government to fulfil the prime minister\u2019s \"personal mission\" to combat people smuggling at source rather than just trying to stop boats in the Channel.",

      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "From this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other means-tested help, meaning an estimated 10 million pensioners will no longer be eligible to receive it.",
      "Among those are 200,000 Unite members, and the union says it is acting on behalf of retired members struggling to get by.",
      "It says many of them have modest private pensions, making them ineligible for pension credit.",
      "Juliet Jeater is one of 11 Unite members who have joined the union's legal action.",
      "She told the BBC she believed the pension credit threshold was too low, and to qualify for it \"you truly have to be on the breadline\".",
      "Ms Jeater, a retired teacher in her seventies who lives in a Northamptonshire village, said she needed the winter fuel payment to pay for heating her cottage.",
      "In the recent cold snap, she was given scrap wood from a neighbour, who is a scaffolder, to heat her home.",
      "A former Labour member who joined the Green Party, Ms Jeater said she was surprised to find herself better off under the last Conservative government.",
      "She said: \"I feel quite angry about what has happened.",
      "\"Last year when we had a Conservative government, I actually received \u00a3500, which was the winter fuel allowance plus a cost-of-living payment.",
      "\"This year I get nothing.\"",
      "Unite claims the government should have done more to gather evidence on the impact of the cuts before announcing them.",
      "The union threatened to take legal action earlier this month, unless the government cancelled the cuts or produced more evidence for them.",
      "Now, it has instructed lawyers who are asking the High Court for an urgent judicial review of the policy.",
      "The government did undertake a limited \"equality analysis\" of the policy, which was disclosed to MPs last week and revealed an estimated 50,000 people could fall into relative poverty next year as a result of the change.",
      "Ministers say this figure does not take account of its ongoing drive to increase the take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming it.",
      "But the union says this falls short of a full impact assessment, which would also take the effect on older people\u2019s health into account .",
      "The union has also claimed that the independent Social Security Advisory Committee should have been consulted in advance.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has argued she had to act urgently to bring in the necessary regulations before winter, and to make in-year savings in government spending.",
      "'Not going away'",
      "Ms Graham told the BBC the government had \"brought something in without knowing what it is going to cost in terms of illness, what it is going to cost in terms of death\".",
      "Asked why she was backing potentially costly legal action, she said: \u2018\"What I want is for the courts to hear this quickly, and to say if the proper impact assessment wasn\u2019t done, then actually the government needs to go back to the beginning and in the interim, they need to pay the winter fuel allowance for this year\".",
      "Otherwise, she argued that \"people will not forgive Labour\u2019s decision\".",
      "\"This issue is not going away,\" she added.",
      "Official figures released on Thursday showed there has been a rise in the number of people applying for pension credit since the decision in July to link it to the winter fuel payment.",
      "About 150,000 people applied for the top-up in the 16 weeks following the announcement, compared to 61,300 in the 16 weeks before.",
      "The government has said that it can not comment on ongoing legal action, but that pensions will increase under the \"triple-lock\" uprating policy and that some pensioners will get an additional \u00a3150 warm home discount.",
      "There is no guarantee that taking legal action will stop the cuts.",
      "Government sources seem confident that the policy will not be reversed in the courts.",
      "But Unite\u2019s action once again highlights the controversy over the cuts as winter approaches.",
      "Pressure on the government at Westminster is likely to mount further if the Scottish government were to decide to mitigate the cuts in next week\u2019s budget.",
      "And the cross-party Work and Pensions Committee is to start an inquiry into pensioner poverty - partly prompted by the cuts - in January.",

      "These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded).",
      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",

      "Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or Crown Prosecution Service.",

      "In 2020, MPs urged the then government to strengthen safeguards around private prosecutions.",
      "And on Thursday, Justice Minister Heidi Alexander told BBC News the new government would now follow up these concerns.",
      "The Horizon scandal revealed the Post Office had failed to ensure its private prosecutions of sub-postmasters were appropriate - and a public inquiry is looking into what went wrong.",
      "And on Thursday, Alexander told BBC News: \u201cWe've seen, through things like the Horizon scandal with the Post Office, private prosecutions being brought which resulted in wrongful convictions.",
      "\u201cNot quite as extreme as that is what happens to some vulnerable people through the use of the single justice procedure.",
      "\u201cSome of the time, organisations are prosecuting individuals where perhaps the public interest in that prosecution hasn't been proved.",
      "\u201cWe want to talk to these organisations so that we can improve the safeguards, so that we make sure that justice and the administration of justice is done fairly.\u201d",
      "There is no public register of private prosecutions - but it is widely thought there could be about 300,000 such cases a year.",

      "These are paper-based prosecutions in which someone is accused by post of a minor offence, such as a car-insurance violation, and has to defend themselves by letter before a magistrate reaches a verdict behind closed doors. There\u2019s no hearing unless the defendant insists on one.",

      "Ford UK has called on the government to introduce incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric vehicles (EVs) as an industry backlash grows over sales targets.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told the BBC that without demand, a government mandate to produce and sell more EVs \"just doesn't work\".",
      "The comments add to a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "On Tuesday, Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, said it would close a plant in Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, partly due to the EV targets.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Stellantis's decision was \"a dark day for Luton\".",
      "It joins Ford in axing UK jobs. Last week, it announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years, partly due to the EV target but also because of increased competition.",
      "Ms Brankin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "She said Ford has invested \"significantly\" in the production and development of EVs, with \"well over\" \u00a3350m put into electrification in the UK.",
      "\"So we kind of need to make it work,\" she said.",
      "Both firms have previously raised doubts about their future in the UK because of other factors, separate to EV targets.",
      "Ford closed its Bridgend factory in 2020, axing 1,644 jobs, citing Covid-19 as one of the reasons while Vauxhall's former owner suggested in 2019 that Brexit threatened its Luton factory.",
      "Meanwhile, some analysts have said a shift towards luxury vehicles and away from cheaper models are also part of the reason for Ford's problems.",
      "Reynolds blamed the previous government for Stellantis' Luton closure, saying Labour had \"inherited a position of extreme frustration\".",
      "He said there would be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced, but reiterated Labour's commitment to a 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "However, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the 2030 target was a \"jobs killer\" and that Stellantis' decision was \"the direct result of a government policy that is simply unworkable for industry\".",
      "The previous Conservative government moved the deadline for the phase-out from 2030 to 2035, but it kept penalties for non-compliance.",
      "Under the current mandate, a percentage of the cars that companies sell must qualify as zero-emission.",
      "EVs must make up 22% of a company's car sales and 10% of its van sales this year.",
      "For every car sale outside of that, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine.",
      "That target is set to rise to 28% for cars and 16% for vans in 2025. The rules will then get tougher every year ahead of a complete ban of new petrol and diesel car sales.",

      "In practice, this means firms could buy credits from companies such as Tesla or Chinese firm BYD, which build electric models exclusively.",
      "Manufacturers argue that demand for electric cars has not been as high as was expected when the rules were drawn up.",
      "As a result, to avoid fines, they say they are having to discount new vehicles heavily, or subsidise rivals that only build electric cars, none of whom have a manufacturing base in the UK.",
      "Sales of electric cars have, however, been increasing. In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Reynolds told an industry audience at a dinner hosted by Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) on Tuesday he is \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the way zero-emissions policies currently operate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the policies that we have inherited, and I mean specifically in relation to zero emission vehicles, are operating today in a way anyone intended them to,\" he said.",

      "A number of options have been suggested, such as allowing sales credits to be transferred between cars and vans and giving \"credits\" for British-made EVs sold abroad.",
      "The SMMT has called for urgent government intervention to safeguard the sector, warning that weak demand for electric cars and the requirement to fulfil sales quotas had \"the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",

      "MPs normally gauge the mood of their constituents via the emails that flood into their offices, discussions and regular meetings.",
      "But the assisted dying bill feels different, inspiring greater reflection and a deeper dive into personal experiences.",
      "In the week leading up to the debate, Tomlinson has attended two town hall gatherings: one with constituents in favour and one with those against.",
      "Hundreds braved a wintry London evening at the Finchley Reform Synagogue to hear speakers, including a palliative care doctor and Tory peer Lord Finkelstein, argue the case for assisted dying.",
      "The crowd was calm and receptive but the air chilled momentarily when Tomlinson asked if the law might push more people to end their lives to avoid burdening families or the NHS.",
      "The people gathered in the synagogue were eager for religious, legal and data-driven arguments in favour of assisted dying, and many voiced fears about loved ones in agony who would be ineligible under the terms of the proposed law.",
      "Outside the meeting, one organiser Andrew Jacobs, 70, said he would \"be very disappointed\" if Tomlinson did not vote in favour of the bill on Friday.",
      "In a matter-of-fact tone, Mr Jacobs said he backed assisted dying after seeing his mother's struggle during her final days.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018my body is a burden to me. If I were a pet, you\u2019d put me down',\u201d he recalled.",

      "Reflecting on the discussion, Tomlinson says he recognises the strength of \"emotion and feeling in this debate - and that\u2019s right and proper\".",
      "\"But I didn't come into politics to shy away from difficult and challenging questions.\"",
      "Tomlinson's fellow Labour MP, Jess Asato, has also spent the last two weeks holding regular meetings with constituents.",
      "A debate held in a cavernous theatre in her Lowestoft constituency saw locals clash over both the principle and scope of the bill.",
      "A terminally ill man who had been left \"severely disabled\" argued he deserved the right to access assisted dying.",
      "The silent hall erupted into applause as he told the crowd: \"I want to decide when I want to go, I want to go peacefully.\"",
      "After the meeting, Asato tells the BBC that MPs \"feel the pressure\" of the bill, and that she feels the \"responsibility to vote with my conscience, for my constituents and the country\u201d.",
      "She says she is approaching the debate from a \"policy perspective\".",
      "To do this, she is trying to \"understand what has happened in other countries such as Canada and the Netherlands\u201d which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "A key concern is whether the safeguards in the bill are robust enough to prevent people from being pressured or coerced into ending their lives.",
      "Before entering Parliament, Asato worked as a domestic abuse campaigner and learned \"many people never spot coercive controlling behaviour - often not even the victims themselves\u201d.",

      "As well as public meetings, MPs have been consulting widely in private.",
      "Tomlinson says he has been meeting healthcare workers and GPs who may end up being responsible for enacting new assisted dying legislation.",
      "Paul turned to her friend Dr David Montgomery, a former Tory parliamentary candidate and medical researcher.",
      "Huddled against the cold in a park near Paul's Reigate constituency, Dr Montgomery argues it is difficult to accurately predict if someone has six months left to live: a key strand of the bill.",
      "\u201cYou can tell when people are very close to death.",
      "\"But the prediction of six months as an arbitrary figure which is going to be open to huge interpretation and therefore I suspect quite a lot of legal challenge.\"",

      "It was watching her father suffer through a painful terminal illness that led the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, Catherine Fookes, to support the bill.",
      "\"The last few days were incredibly difficult, he was in a lot of pain and it was really, really, really hard to see someone you really love going through that,\" she says.",
      "\"He struggled to breathe and so seeing him like that made me realise that we needed a change of the law.\"",
      "Fookes admits it wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but says her dad's struggle informed her choice.",

      "The \u00a3200m rescue package to increase access to NHS dentistry in England this year is not on track, a spending watchdog says.",
      "The dental recovery plan published by the Conservative government in February set a target of 1.5 million extra treatments in 2024-25.",
      "To achieve that, dentists were offered an increase in payments for seeing NHS patients as well as a premium top-up payment of up to \u00a350 for taking on new patients.",
      "Mobile dental vans were also due to be rolled out to target the areas with the worst access.",
      "But the National Audit Office says slow progress means those goals for this year will likely be missed.",
      "It acknowledges the general election is a factor, but says the new government must reflect on the long-standing problems in NHS dentistry.",
      "The target to increase the number of treatments by 1.5 million to 37.1 million this year would still leave the NHS below the activity levels seen in 2018-19.",
      "And at the time it was published dentists criticised the lack of ambition, saying it would not do enough to encourage dentists to do more NHS work.",
      "More than a fifth of dentists are thought to do solely private work.",
      "'Unambitious'",
      "The plan included a \u00a35 increase to \u00a328 for each unit of NHS activity alongside a premium payment worth up to \u00a350 to see patients who had not seen an NHS dentist for two years.",
      "By September 2024, there had been an increase in the number of dental practices taking on new NHS patients, the NAO said, but this has still not led to an increase in treatments being done beyond what would have been expected without the extra payments.",
      "The NAO also noted no new dental vans were in operation yet \u2013 these mobile units were seen as key part of the solution to boosting access in the areas most struggling.",
      "The plan also included some longer-term measures, including \u201cgolden hellos\u201d of \u00a320,000 to recruit dentists to work in specific regions over three years, and Smile for Life - a dental decay prevention scheme targeted at young children.",
      "Shawn Charlwood, of the British Dental Association, said the NAO report showed more fundamental reform of the NHS dental contract was needed.",
      "\u201cWe warned at the outset that this recovery plan was unworthy of the title.",
      "\u201cUnfunded, unambitious policies failed to make a dent in a crisis hitting millions.\u201d",
      "Louise Ansari, of the patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said she agreed NHS dentistry needed to be urgently reformed.",
      "\u201cOverall, the NAO paints a picture of delayed and confused efforts.\u201d",
      "Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said the government had inherited a recovery plan that was \"not fit for purpose\" and it would be developing further measures to improve access.",

Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease.

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",

      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues.

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:13:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "COP29 is over, with developing countries complaining that the $300bn (about \u00a3240bn) a year in climate finance they will receive by 2035 is a \"paltry sum\".",
      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",
      "\u201cIt's a paltry sum,\" India's delegate Chandni Raina told other delegates, after the deal had been gavelled through.",
      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",
      "Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.",
      "But this package is also being criticised as short-sighted from the richer world\u2019s perspective.",
      "The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.",
      "New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.",
      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",
      "And at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and distraction, keeping countries united on climate should be critical. The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",
      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",
      "Similarly, in the final plenary when all countries accepted the finance text, there were brash cheers when speakers from several nations spoke out against the agreement, after the gavelling.",
      "Will confrontational activism and fraught debate become the new norm at a diplomatic climate conference?",
      "We will have to wait for the next COP to see.",
      "Climate deal too little too late, poorer nations say",

    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

      "Some of their disagreements stem from serious business matters, such as a failed collaboration in 2016 when a SpaceX rocket exploding while carrying a Facebook satellite.",

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "Images also show Israeli troops and vehicles have been stationed across the new divide. Analysts said the images suggest Gaza is being split into zones to make it easier to control.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it was \"targeting terrorist operatives and infrastructure\" in north Gaza.",
      "Dr H A Hellyer, a Middle East security expert from the Rusi think tank, said the satellite images suggested Israel was preparing to block Palestinian civilians from returning to the north Gaza governorate. More than 100,000 people have already been displaced from the far north of Gaza, according to the UN.",
      "Images appear to show two long sections of road on either end of the strip being connected by cleared land through an urban area. Buildings are being demolished between the two sections of road, with a clear pattern visible since early October.",
      "This partition stretches about 5.6 miles (9km) across Gaza, from east to west, dividing Gaza City and the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in north Gaza.",
      "The BBC has been told that there is a tactical route between Jabalia and Gaza City, which is part of operational activities targeting Hamas in Jabalia.",

      "The graphic below shows examples geolocated by BBC Verify along the new corridor.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC that it had no intention of destroying civilian infrastructure \"without operational necessity\" to neutralise Hamas.",
      "Other footage shows IDF Humvee vehicles being driven through the cleared area from the direction of Israel. Humvees are not as heavily armoured as other military vehicles - and Dr Hellyer told the BBC that they were unlikely to be used unless the military was confident about their safety, indicating that Israeli troops are in control of the area.",
      "Some analysts believe the IDF\u2019s presence could indicate a permanent military partition \u2013 giving it control of who can travel between the Gaza and the north Gaza governorates.",
      "Dr Hellyer said of the IDF: \u201cThey\u2019re digging in for the long term. I would absolutely expect the north partition to develop exactly like the Netzarim Corridor.\u201d",
      "The BBC has previously documented how two partitions have been constructed in Gaza since the start of the current war. The Netzarim Corridor splits an area south of Gaza City, while the Philadelphi Corridor gives the IDF control of land running the length of Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "BBC analysis of this new partition in the north shows a similar pattern to the construction of the previous corridors over the past year, with existing and newly built roads being connected and military positions emerging at regular intervals. Buildings and agricultural land are cleared so roads can be paved and military infrastructure built.",
      "Dr Eado Hecht from the Begin\u2013Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (Besa), an Israeli think tank specialising in national security and foreign policy, agreed that the data showed a new dividing line, but questioned whether it was designed to be permanent.",
      "\u201cThere is a new partition corridor separating Gaza City and the northern towns of the Gaza Strip. The goal is to cut off the Hamas - and other organizations' - forces that have returned to that area from support and the ability to retreat, so they can be dealt with more effectively.\u201d",
      "Israel has denied that it is implementing the \"General\u2019s Plan\". Under the strategy, devised by former general Giora EIland, civilians would be told to leave the north, supplies would be blocked and the area would become a military zone. Those who remained would be treated as combatants and faced with the choice of \u201csurrender or starve\", with the aim of putting pressure on Hamas to release its hostages.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, an IDF spokesperson said: \"The IDF operates according to well-established military plans, and the claim that the IDF is implementing this specific plan is incorrect.\"",
      "But concerns have mounted over the safety of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who remain in besieged towns in north Gaza.",
      "The UN and aid charities have raised significant concerns about the situation in the north of Gaza. While thousands of people have been displaced, the UN says over 65,000 people could remain in the area.",
      "The UN also said that \"virtually no aid\" has entered parts of the North Gaza governorate in 40 days on the 20 November. A spokesperson on 26 November said that Palestinians were facing \u201cfacing critical shortages of supplies and services, as well as severe overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions\u201d due to the blockade.",
      "Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in the besieged areas of northern Gaza.",
      "BBC analysis shows around 90% of north Gaza has been subject to evacuation orders since the start of October. Videos posted on social media document people being moved south of the new partition. It is not clear if and when they will be able to return, but Israel\u2019s foreign minister has insisted civilians will be allowed to return after the war.",
      "Satellite images show the displacement of people in north Gaza. Large groups of tents, erected as temporary shelter, disappear. In the area left behind, there are often destroyed buildings and other examples of military activity.",
      "While the IDF appears to have established enough control in the area to travel in lightly armoured vehicles, heavy fighting has also persisted in the area between IDF troops and Hamas fighters.",
      "Videos posted by Hamas fighters show clashes with IDF tanks in the area around the dividing line.",

      "The boss of the company behind global fashion chain Uniqlo has told the BBC that the Japanese firm does not use cotton from the Xinjiang region of China in its products.",
      "It is the first time Fast Retailing's chief executive Tadashi Yanai has directly addressed the contentious issue.",
      "China is a crucial market for Uniqlo not just for customers but also as a major manufacturing hub.",
      "Xinjiang cotton was once known as some of the best fabric in the world.",
      "But it has fallen out of favour after revelations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority.",
      "In 2022, tough US regulations on the import of goods from Xinjiang came into effect.",
      "Many global brands removed products using Xinjiang cotton from their shelves, which led to fierce backlash in China. Brands such as H&M, Nike, Burberry, Esprit and Adidas were boycotted.",
      "Sweden's H&M saw its clothing pulled from major e-commerce stores in China.",
      "At the time, Mr Yanai - who is Japan's richest man - refused to confirm or deny whether Xinjiang cotton was used in Uniqlo clothing, saying he wanted \"to be neutral between the US and China\".",
      "His decision not to take a side helped Uniqlo to remain popular in China's huge retail market.",
      "But speaking to the BBC in Tokyo about the firm's measures to be more transparent about where the materials in its clothes come from and how they are made, he said: \"We\u2019re not using [cotton from Xinjiang].\"",

      "Isaac Stone Fish, the chief executive and founder of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm with a China focus highlights the pressures on firms from both China and the US.",
      "\"Not a single large company can remain politically neutral anymore,\" he says.",

      "Even though Uniqlo has been expanding aggressively in Europe and the US, in Mr Yanai's own words, \"we are not a known brand globally\" and Asia is still its biggest market.",
      "The company has more stores in China than in its home country Japan, and Mr Yanai says he does not plan to change that strategy despite challenges in the world's second biggest economy.",
      "\u201cThere are 1.4 billion people in China and we only have 900 to 1,000 stores,\" he says. \"I think we can increase that to 3,000.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, China is Uniqlo's single biggest manufacturing hub. The company also makes clothes in countries including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and India.",
      "In 2009, when 80% of its products were made in China, Mr Yanai told the BBC that China was getting too expensive and the firm was shifting production away \"to lower-wage Cambodia to keep prices low\".",
      "He now says it was challenging to repeat China's success as the world's factory in other countries as transferring years of experience proved difficult.",
      "Retailers like Uniqlo are also facing intense competition from ultra-fast fashion as brands like China's Shein and Temu gain popularity with price-conscious customers.",
      "But Mr Yanai says \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a future for fast fashion\".",
      "\"They\u2019re producing clothes without any careful consideration which you only wear for one season. That is a waste of the planet\u2019s resources.\"",
      "He adds that Uniqlo's strategy is to focus on essential items that can be worn for years.",
      "In the 40 years that he has been in charge of the firm, Mr Yanai has grown the business he inherited from his father from a company with annual sales of around 100 million yen ($656,700; \u00a3522,400) to a global chain with 3 trillion yen of revenues this year.",
      "The 75-year-old says he aims to overtake Inditex, which owns the global chain Zara, as the world's biggest fashion retailer before he retires.",
      "But to achieve that, Uniqlo needs to expand not just in China but also in the West, where shoppers are increasingly conscious of human rights issues such as forced labour.",
      "Mr Yanai's ambitions may also face more hurdles as Donald Trump returns to the White House on a pledge to impose much higher tariffs on Chinese-made goods."

      "But the president-elect subsequently softened his position, telling a podcast in October it was \"nice\" Mr Zuckerberg was \"staying out of the election\", and thanking him for a personal phone call after he faced an assassination attempt.",
      "There have have also been indications Mr Zuckerberg is attempting to be more accommodating towards America's incoming president.",
      "Trump was thrown off Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram in 2021 for what the company called his \"praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "But that suspension has since been lifted.",
      "In August this year, Mr Zuckerberg spoke of his regret at de-promoting content relating to allegations about Joe Biden's son Hunter, which had been a right-wing talking point in the US prior to the 2020 presidential election.",
      "He also said he would make no more contributions to support electoral infrastructure, after a $400m (\u00a3302m) donation in 2020 was viewed by some online as a way of skirting donation limits.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg said his donations had been designed to be non-partisan, and his goal was to be neutral in elections.",
      "Big tech buddies",

      "Meta has though been facing increasing regulation in recent years, including an ongoing antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020.",
      "Even so, Mr Zuckerberg's apparently improving relations with the president-elect have been totally eclipsed by Trump's closeness to Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's close-knit relationship with the X owner resulted in more than $100m (\u00a379m) in campaign donations, along with endorsements from the billionaire and his superfans.",
      "Their relationship is so tight it has caused some to dub Musk his \"First Buddy\", a play on the president's wife being named First Lady.",
      "It has ultimately led to the billionaire being placed in charge of a new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which may give him not only influence over government policy, but the very regulation threatening his business empire.",
      "However, Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Musk have a longstanding rivalry.",
      "Some of their disagreements stem from serious business matters, such as a failed collaboration in 2016 when a SpaceX rocket exploding while carrying a Facebook satellite.",
      "Their beef rumbled on eventually becoming a war of words over a potential cagefight.",

      "\"Dangerously cold wind chills\" are anticipated over the northern Plains on Thursday by the National Weather Service (NWS).",
      "Meanwhile, parts of the north-east including New England could see heavy snow, and the East Coast is expected to be hit by thunderstorms.",
      "The severe conditions come in a week expected to set records for Thanksgiving travel. Thousands of flights were delayed and dozens cancelled on Wednesday, according to tracking site FlightAware.",
      "The snow expected on Thursday could fall in Maine, New York state and the north Appalachians, said BBC Weather forecaster Elizabeth Rizzini.",
      "The thunderstorms could affect Georgia, plus North and South Carolina, she added.",
      "Stormy conditions are then expected to reach the Midwest on Friday, bringing lake-effect snow and severe thunderstorms.",
      "Lake-effect snow happens when cold air passes over unfrozen and relatively warm waters - in this case in the Great Lakes - causing the air to rise and form clouds that produce snow. Up to 8in (20cm) could fall in some places, the NWS says.",
      "Flight disruption has been reported as holidaymakers attempt to make seasonal journeys. More than 4,500 delays within, into or out of the US were logged by FlightAware on Wednesday. There were 61 cancellations.",
      "The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) says passenger volumes during this year's Thanksgiving have already reached record highs.",

    "summary": "A shadowy operative appears to overstep his mark in the battle for Russian influence in Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Dodging bullets, ducking explosions, safeguarding state secrets.",
      "Bombastic propaganda films present the shadowy Russian political operative Maxim Shugalei as a heroic figure - who will apparently stop at nothing in his quest to promote the country abroad.",
      "While his escapades have no doubt been exaggerated, in real life he has played a significant role in the expansion of Russia's influence in parts of Africa, working closely with the Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries.",
      "However, this would-be iron man recently suffered a set-back when he was arrested in the central African nation of Chad.",
      "He, along with fellow Russian operatives Samer Sueifan and E Tsaryov, were detained in September on unexplained charges, before being freed and sent home earlier this month, according to the Russian embassy.",
      "Who is Maxim Shugalei?",
      "Shugalei tends to describe himself as a \"sociologist\" but in reality, say analysts, he is a spin doctor and an agent of Russian influence known for his work on the African continent.",
      "He has been under EU sanctions since 2023 for overseeing disinformation campaigns to promote the Wagner Group in several African countries, and is also the subject of Ukrainian sanctions.",
      "Since at least 2010, Shugalei was affiliated with the late Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss and a close associate of President Vladimir Putin.",
      "While Shugalei used to deny these ties - as was customary in Prigozhin's circles - he nevertheless first came to media attention for his work and subsequent arrest in Libya on charges of spying and meddling in elections on behalf of the Wagner boss.",
      "Prigozhin had tasked Shugalei with gathering information and preparing a strategy to support Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of former leader Muammar Gaddafi.",
      "When Shugalei returned to Russia, Prigozhin revealed that he had given him 18m rubles ($173,000; \u00a3138,000) \u2013 1m rubles for each month he had spent in captivity.",
      "Shugalei's escapades in Libya formed the basis for a trilogy of action TV films, seemingly sponsored by Prigozhin. They were designed to, among other things, glorify the regime of then-Wagner ally Khalifa Haftar in eastern Libya and whitewash Russia\u2019s activities in Africa.",
      "The role of Shugalei was played by the actor Kirill Polukhin, and the films show him as \"almost a James Bond figure, or Mission Impossible type\", says Ladd Serwat, an Africa Regional Specialist at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled).",
      "\"We are shown this macho, tough person who is unwilling to crack under pressure or give away national secrets \u2013 then is very capable as a mercenary or independent military operator.\"",
      "A modest-sized online fan page falsely claims that \"Shugalei\" has even become an Arabic word for \"man of iron who cannot be broken\".",
      "But as a key player in the expansion of Russia's influence in Africa in recent years, he has also been involved in some extraordinary activities in real life.",
      "In 2018, a BBC investigation found that he was one of several Russian operatives who were caught offering suitcases full of cash to presidential candidates in Madagascar.",
      "There is a stark contrast between the benevolent, saviour image Russia\u2019s influence network projects and the reality on the ground, say analysts.",
      "\"Industrial and artisanal miners have been attacked or abducted by Wagner mercenaries and pushed out of areas - such as Ndassima [in the Central African Republic] - where they were operating in order to make space for Prigozhin-linked businesses to operate,\" says Mr Serwat.",
      "Wagner fighters have accused been accused by rights groups of committing horrific atrocities \u2013 including a massacre in Mali, the abduction and rape of teenage girls, and massacring civilians to secure access to lucrative gold mines.",
      "Before his activities abroad, the only public episode of Shugalei's career as a political consultant dates back to the 2002 elections for the St Petersburg parliament.",
      "At the time, Shugalei served as a representative for one of the candidates and famously ate several documents during an electoral commission meeting to prevent them from being submitted to court.",
      "How influential is Shugalei?",
      "Under Prigozhin, Shugalei's official position was head of the Foundation for the Protection of National Values, a pro-Wagner organisation and public relations firm.",
      "Unofficially, he worked in various African states to try to ensure regimes favourable to Wagner would come to, and remain in, power, as part of Russia's attempts to gain influence on the continent - especially at the expense of France.",
      "Since the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin last year, troops serving under the Wagner banner in Ukraine and Africa have been absorbed into Russia's official military structure.",
      "However, Prigozhin's media empire, which Shugalei was a part of, has crumbled.",
      "As someone who operates in the shadows, it is hard to know exactly how much influence he wields.",
      "Yet, according to some, Shugalei may not have lost too much influence despite the death of his mentor.",
      "\"He still seems to have the same level of influence, despite the fact that the Kremlin seems to have taken over the majority of Wagner group operations,\" says Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst covering Francophone Africa for Control Risks.",
      "He seemingly no longer denies his ties to Wagner and Prigozhin \u2013 his Telegram channel is full of posts commemorating the late oligarch and his mercenary group, and he even reposts Wagner\u2019s recruitment information.",
      "Yet, aside from his arrest in Chad and a July trip to Angola which he documented on Telegram, it is hard to tell the full scale of his current activities.",
      "Why was he arrested in Chad?",
      "Chad has given no official reason for the arrest of Shugalei and his two associates.",
      "Multiple theories abound \u2013 some more plausible than others.",
      "Russian state-controlled news channel RT reported that the arrests were instigated by France, but this is most likely a fiction designed to save face, Ms Ochieng tells the BBC.",
      "Since at least May, Russia has been pushing the narrative that the West's traditional influence in Chad is waning.",
      "But, although Chad has recently signed deals with Russia on infrastructure and security, it still hosts French troops, and retains good relations with the former colonial power, unlike several of its Francophone neighbours which have tilted towards Russia.",
      "There is no evidence of a Russian military presence in the country.",
      "In fact, some argue that Chadian President Mahamat D\u00e9by is expertly playing Russia and the West against each other, to Chad's advantage.",
      "Russia is striving to gain complete dominance over West Africa's Sahel region, and already has close ties to two of Chad's neighbours - Niger, and the Central Africa Republic (CAR), the country where Russia's influence is strongest on the continent.",
      "Wagner fighters are said to have infiltrated Chad from the CAR and clashed with the local army, before retreating.",
      "If Russia could bring Chad into its orbit, that would create an uninterrupted sphere of influence stretching thousands of miles.",
      "Shugalei had visited Chad twice before, and notably held talks with D\u00e9by's campaign team prior to the presidential elections in May. He was also linked to the Russia House cultural centre in the capital, N'Djamena, which recently unveiled a new headquarters at a ceremony attended by Russian government officials.",
      "Last year, US intelligence services said they had discovered that Wagner allegedly orchestrated a plot to assassinate D\u00e9by but failed to carry it out.",
      "Mr Serwat suggests this may be why Shugalei was arrested.",
      "Ms Ochieng says Chad may have been worried about Shugalei's potential to try and destabilise the country by spreading disinformation.",
      "Shugalei's foundation has denied that he is a \"Wagner spy\", saying Shugalei \"does not know anything in particular about Wagner Group's activities in Africa and only knows general details about what it did previously\".",
      "Russian-backed social media content, TV stations and news sites are being deployed to spread a pro-Russian agenda and disinformation, especially in Africa, according to analysts.",
      "Examples include Afrique Media TV which broadcasts from Cameroon as far afield as CAR, Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger - and is also on YouTube where it has thousands of followers, and enjoys a large Facebook following.",
      "Shugalei himself teases his presence in various African countries, sometimes sharing short, low-budget, vlog-style Telegram videos that make clear his love of showmanship.",
      "Of the video content aimed at Africans, many take on a fable-like appearance \u2013 one, called LionBear - shows a bear (which symbolises Russia) running across the globe to defend a lion (his Central African Republic friend) from the malign influence of hyenas.",
      "\"I don't think people necessarily are won over by these videos \u2013 people think it's funny, a joke,\" says Ms Ochieng.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 06:10:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Chinese women have taken it upon themselves to prove that the length of sanitary pads often fall short of what is advertised.",
    "story": [
      "Major sanitary pad makers in China are apologising after being accused of selling pads that are shorter than advertised.",
      "It comes amid a storm of anger after viral social media videos showed Chinese women measuring the lengths of sanitary pads from popular brands - showing that most of them fell short of what was stated on their packaging.",
      "The uproar has extended into broader grievances about women being short-changed by feminine hygiene products, which have a history of safety scandals in China.",
      "Chinese women have taken it upon themselves to call out quality concerns in sanitary pads, the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in the country.",
      "In one of the earliest videos, posted on 3 November, a user on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu examined nine brands of sanitary pads with a measuring tape, showing that they all fell short of the length stated on their packaging.",
      "\"Will cutting a few centimetres help you strike it rich?\" the user wrote in her video.",
      "The revelations soon ignited widespread criticism, with consumers accusing sanitary pad makers of being deceitful.",
      "\"The inflated sanitary pad length is just like the insoles under men\u2019s feet,\" reads one popular Weibo post.",
      "Amid the uproar, an investigation of over 20 different sanitary pads by Chinese news outlet The Paper found that nearly 90% of the products were \"shrunken\", measuring at least 10mm shorter than claimed on their packaging. Tucked within most of them were even shorter absorbent layers, which are meant to soak up menstrual flow.",
      "The Paper also reported that while national standards for sanitary pads specify that the products can measure within 4% of advertised lengths, they do not specify the length of the absorbent layer in sanitary pads.",
      "Following a torrent of complaints, authorities said they were revising the current national standard on sanitary pads, according to local media.",
      "Met with enquiries and complaints from customers about the discrepancy in its sanitary pad lengths, the popular Chinese brand ABC further stoked outrage after its customer service reportedly responded to a complaint by saying \"if you cannot accept [the length difference] then you can choose not to buy it\".",
      "ABC said in a statement in mid-November that it was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"inappropriate\" response, and promised to improve its products to achieve \"zero deviation\". Other companies including Shecare and Beishute have also issued apologies.",
      "Chinese state media has also weighed in on the controversy, criticising manufacturers for cutting corners.",
      "\"As a daily necessity for women, quality of sanitary pads is directly related to the health and comfort of the user,\" reads a Xinhua article. \"The problems existing in some products on the market cannot be ignored.\"",
      "Sanitary pads are the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in China, where the market is valued at $13bn (\u00a310bn). However, the products have also made headlines over the years for safety issues.",
      "In 2016, police busted a massive \"fake sanitary towel\" operation in southeast China, where millions of sanitary pads were manufactured in a factory without proper hygiene measures and packaged as popular brands. In 2021, popular feminine hygiene brand Space 7 apologised and vowed an investigation after a woman claimed she found a needle in one of its sanitary pads.",
      "The wave of anger also reflects broader grievances felt by women over the quality of products meant for them.",
      "\"Is it that hard for sanitary pads to tackle women\u2019s needs?\" reads a trending hashtag on Weibo.",
      "Another trending phrase that has caught on amid the blowback encapsulates the outrage: \"Sanitary pads yield a centimetre; women yield for a lifetime.\""

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 19:50:47 GMT",
    "summary": "What the latest developments mean for Iran's position - and for the prospect of peace in Gaza",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Jeremy read this article",
      "Listen to Jeremy read this article",
      "For most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I\u2019m attending in Rome said she couldn\u2019t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer.",
      "\u201cIt was like the night before Christmas when you\u2019re a kid. I couldn\u2019t wait for it to happen.\u201d",
      "You can see why there\u2019s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes.",
      "Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed.",
      "But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel\u2019s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000 civilians evacuated further south.",
      "Israel\u2019s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.",
      "In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates a buffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.",
      "Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse.",
      "Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.",
      "All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.",
      "But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu\u2019s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu\u2019s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.",
      "The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel\u2019s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah\u2019s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel\u2019s invasion force. But Hezbollah is no longer the same threat to Israel.",
      "Netanyahu: Time to 'replenish stocks\u2019",
      "Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.",
      "Israel\u2019s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.",
      "If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.",
      "In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance \u2018to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,\u2019 he continued.",
      "Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel\u2019s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive.",
      "There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel\u2019s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran\u2019s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies.",
      "Why Iran wanted a ceasefire",
      "Just like Hezbollah\u2019s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah\u2019s assassination did not repair the damage.",
      "Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon \u2013 but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.",
      "Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s deterrence strategy matched Israel\u2019s own deterrence for almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel\u2019s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.",
      "Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.",
      "Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah\u2019s tunnel network.",
      "Trump, Gaza and the future",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.",
      "It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s political survival, and his government\u2019s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged.",
      "The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon\u2019s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran.",
      "The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel \u2013 the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza.",
      "What is certain though is that the Middle East has no chance of escaping more generations of war and violent death until the region\u2019s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel\u2019s favour.",
      "In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.",

    "story": [
      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "\"This crisis is not invisible to the UN, to our humanitarians on the front line risking and losing their lives to help the Sudanese people,\" he told the BBC, as we travelled with him on his week-long trip.",
      "Most of the people on his team working on the ground are also Sudanese who have lost their homes, their old lives, in this brutal struggle for power between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).",

      "They lived with their carers in the capital, Khartoum, until the army and RSF turned their guns on each other in April 2023, trapping the orphanage as they dragged their country  into a vortex of horrific violence, systematic looting and shocking abuse.",

    "title": "Why Muslims in India are opposing changes to a property law",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 07:46:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Muslim groups say the changes are politically motivated but the government says it is responding to demands for reform.",
    "story": [
      "A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country.",
      "The properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board.",
      "The new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was expected to be tabled in the current parliament session after incorporating changes suggested by a joint committee of MPs.",
      "But the committee is now set to ask for more time to submit its recommendations.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the proposed changes are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community.",
      "But several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities.",
      "The bill was first introduced in parliament in August but then sent to a joint parliamentary committee for their recommendations.",
      "What is waqf?",
      "In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God.",
      "A vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon.",
      "The tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India.",
      "The properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties.",
      "The government says that the waqf boards are among India\u2019s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; \u00a311.26bn).",
      "Is there a need for reform?",
      "Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land.",
      "But critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies \u2013 which too requires immediate attention.",
      "A report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed.",
      "The committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; \u00a31.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees.",
      "The committee also noted that \u201cencroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common\u201d, listing hundreds of instances of such \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d of waqf land by government authorities.",
      "According to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown.",
      "The amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee.",
      "Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties.",
      "Why the controversy?",
      "But many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism.",
      "One of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board.",
      "Many of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago.",
      "The 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.",
      "Professor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system.",
      "\u201cYou can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,\u201d Prof Rehman says.",
      "Others worry that the new bill may not address the community\u2019s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties.",
      "That's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members.",
      "Some agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular.",
      "But the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. \u201cThere seems to be an attempt not only to get the state\u2019s control over Muslims\u2019 properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "What are the other proposed changes?",
      "Among other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf\u2019s claim to a property is valid.",
      "Critics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards.",
      "Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land.",
      "The current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf.",
      "But some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established.",
      "\"Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,\u201d Owaisi recently told reporters.",
      "This process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind.",
      "\u201cThe diagnosis may be correct,\u201d Prof Rehman says, \u201cbut the treatment is not.\u201d"

      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \"ill intent\" to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \"predatory behavior\" and \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment\" \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others' points of view.\"",
      "\"On reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\" the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\"",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\"It is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\"",
      "Rose's downfall was part of America's #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \"Today\" host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others. In September 2018, Rose said the three women he settled with this week were \"exploiting the #MeToo movement\" when he filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \"CBS This Morning,\" and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \"Charlie Rose Show,\" which had been on the air since 1991.",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \"sexually inappropriate\" while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \"very subtle\" and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \"always professional and respectful.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rapper Drake's company Frozen Moments filed a petition in a New York court Monday accusing the streaming service Spotify and Universal Music Group of conspiring to inflate the streams of Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer. Frozen Moments, described in the filing as \"an entity wholly owned by Drake,\" alleges that UMG \"launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\" with \"Not Like Us\" via bots and pay-for-play agreements.",
      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service. The petition also alleges UMG used bots to drive up the streams on \"Not Like Us,\" paid radio promoters to increase air play and even paid tech giant Apple to have its voice assistant Siri misdirect users to Lamar's hit song.",
      "A spokesperson for UMG called the allegations \"offensive and untrue.\"",
      "\"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, a publicist for Drake Tuesday had no comment. Spotify, Apple and representatives for Lamar did not immediately respond to CBS News requests for comment.",
      "According to the Associated Press, Drake on Tuesday filed a second legal action against UMG, but in Texas, also over \"Not Like Us.\" According to the AP, Tuesday's filing in Bexar County accuses UMG of engaging in \"irregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \"Not Like Us,\" including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia.",
      "When reached by CBS News Tuesday, iHeartMedia also declined to comment.",
      "UMG owns both Interscope, Lamar's label and Republic Records, where Drake has spent his entire career. Drake has mentioned UMG CEO Lucian Grainge in lyrics multiple times over the years, including 2023's \"Away From Home\" \u2014   rapping \"Who the CEO of Universal? They mistaken, 'cause Google saying Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense. Who filling up the piggy bank? Who bringing home the bacon?\" The line seems to indicate Drake's perceived importance to the label as Spotify's second most streamed artist behind Taylor Swift, whose Big Machine Records is also distributed by UMG.",
      "According to the petition, UMG terminated certain employees perceived as being loyal to Drake during the inter-label feud with Lamar, and rebuffed his attempts at negotiation, insisting that Drake take it up with Lamar directly instead of the label.",
      "The petition filed Monday is not a lawsuit, but a pre-action motion meant to gather more information from UMG and Spotify in the pursuit of a civil claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as RICO.",
      "The legal action comes days after Lamar released \"GNX,\" his first album since the beef. Lamar references the feud multiple times on the project, including Snoop Dogg's posting of one of Drake's diss tracks and Lil Wayne taking offense to Lamar's headlining of the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime show in New Orleans.",

      "Bill Heinemann says it's hard to find someone these days who hasn't heard of \"The Oregon Trail.\" The computer game he co-created in 1971 at Carleton College in Northfield has sold tens of millions of copies and is in the World Video Game Hall of Fame.",
      "\"It's surprising and gratifying and humbling, in a way, that a little thing that I spent two weeks on has become a worldwide phenomenon,\" Heinemann said.",
      "The idea sprouted when Heinemann's friend, Don Rawitsch, came up with a board game for students he was teaching that simulated 1800s settlers going west on the Oregon Trail.",
      "Computers were in their very early days, and even though Heinemann says he'd only seen \"Pac-Man,\" he sensed an opportunity.",
      "\"I said, 'That'll be a great application for a computer,' because you wouldn't have to shake the dice to see what happens,\" Heinemann said. \"What happens could come up and be unexpected.\"",
      "The game's become known for the many ways players can die, including by dysentery, but Heinemann's favorite was death by snake bite.",
      "\"It only happened once every several hundred times, and so people could've played it for months and all of a sudden, 'What? I got bit by a snake and died? This has never happened to me before!'\" he said.",
      "Now more than 50 years after the first \"Oregon Trail\" program, Apple is reportedly developing the game into an action-comedy movie.",
      "\"Surprising to me how popular it's become and how long the interest in it has been around,\" Heinemann said. \"And this is just the next step I guess.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "summary": "Barbara Taylor Bradford\u200b was one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

      "As a young man he'd dreamed of a place, a club, where he could get his friends together, and 12 years ago he made it happen in the west Maui city of Lahaina:\u00a0 Fleetwood's on Front Street. The menu was eclectic \u2013 they served everything from Biddie's Chicken (just like Fleetwood's mom, Biddie, made it) to cookie dough desserts dreamed up by his children. It was also a place where Mick and friends could play. \"We created, I created, a band of people under a roof,\" he said. \"Instead of a traveling circus, it was a resident circus at Fleetwood's on Front Street.\"",

      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "title": "Biden administration set to miss chance to lock in new food guidelines",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal panel has been meeting for months to draft recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A monthslong process to decide the federal government's food recommendations for the next five years is now set to stretch well into 2025. That timing means Biden officials will miss their opportunity to lock in new guidelines before the Trump administration takes over.",
      "Switching terms in the middle of an update is unprecedented in recent history, though previous versions have come close: an update in 2005 was finished days before the inauguration and the 2020 revision came a month before Biden took office.",
      "The guidelines are hotly contested in Washington because they influence a broad array of federal programs, ranging from rules on nutrition labels to standards for school lunches. They are traditionally based around a scientific report from outside experts.",
      "That committee has been meeting since last year, wrestling with an array of controversial questions, and is not expected to issue its recommendations until mid-December. It usually takes several months after their report is done for officials to publish their guidelines.",
      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:14:18 -0500",
    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:40:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

      "Americans may be shelling out more for gasoline if the incoming Trump administration follows through on threats to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump this week said he would enact a 25% tariff on all products from both countries, citing concerns about illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. While prices could climb on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S., the potential impact on motorists and on the transportation sector could be particularly acute, analysts say.",

      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, we still import a lot of crude, with Canada providing roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, within as little as two days after the tariffs take effect, De Haan said.",
      "The national average for a gallon of regular on Wednesday stood at $3.07, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "The threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could also result in a $3,000 increase in the cost of the average car, according to Wolfe Research analysts cited by the Wall Street Journal. Roughly $97 billion in auto parts are imported to the U.S. from the two nations annually, and 4 million vehicles are shipped in \u2014 roughly 3 million from Mexico and 1 million from Canada, the firm estimated.",
      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats. Some analysts think the president-elect is likely using the specter of tariffs as a way to wring concessions from other countries, noting that his administration will be eager to avoid setting off another round of inflation just as U.S. prices are growing at a normal level.",

    "story": [
      "Prices could rise\u00a0on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas under tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose as soon as he takes office next year, according to experts.",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The tariffs are not certain to go into effect, and if they are implemented, their impact would depend on how they are structured and if certain categories are exempted.",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have argued that his first-term tariffs didn't boost inflation, and that import taxes can provide valuable benefits to American workers and businesses. Among them, Trump has said, are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs and boosting federal revenue, although tariffs are paid by importers and often passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "For their part, experts and business groups are clear that tariffs would lift prices. A barrage of new duties on foreign imports would likely boost consumer costs on everything from vacuum cleaners to tiki torches, which are largely imported from China and are already subject to tariffs, according to Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group.",
      "\"A lot of vacuum cleaners are made in China, so that's one I could be sort of confident you're going to see some price effects on,\" he said.",
      "Consumer electronics",
      "The tariffs would also reduce American consumers' spending power by $90 billion on products including TVs, headphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, smartphones and other electronics, according to the Consumer Technology Association.",
      "The trade group \u2014 which modeled the impact of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, coupled with a 60% levy on goods from the country that Trump previously floated \u2014 estimated that laptops and tablets would see the steepest price hikes, with costs surging as much as 45%. Video game consoles and smartphones could also see double-digit gains.",
      "Researchers assumed retailers would pass all added costs related to tariffs along to consumers. In the smartphone category, the average increase in price would be $213 per device, according to CTA.",
      "\"The likelihood of retailers or any importer absorbing the tariff cost is very low, so the pass through to consumers will be quick,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at CTA. \"On all the products we looked at, there are going to be price increases.\"",
      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Home furnishings giant Ikea told CNN that Trump's tariffs, if enacted, would make it more difficult for the company to keep its prices low.",
      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",

      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",

    "title": "How Trump's economic agenda could affect mortgage rates in 2025",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 09:52:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "story": [
      "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki knows the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company has been in \"the eye of the storm\" recently, but she said she's confident that the company is still viable and believes it will be \"growing and thriving\" a year from now.",
      "\"I believe in the company. I believe in the long-term mission. But I believe it's essential for us to restructure,\" Wojcicki told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview.",
      "Wojcicki acknowledged recent headlines about the California-based company's struggles, including a data security incident in late 2023, a full board resignation in September, and laying off 40% of the company's workforce in November. In a public letter, the seven board members said it was \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"",
      "The announcement came as a surprise to Wojcicki, saying that she doesn't have \"great insights into what the strategic differences were\" and that \"there was not an overt disagreement.\" Wojcicki has recently said she intends to take the company private and isn't open to considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "\"I will make [mistakes], and I will learn from them\"",
      "Former 23andMe employees were critical of Wojcicki's management style in an October interview with Fortune Magazine \u2013 with one calling her \"outwardly charming, but stubborn and controlling behind the scenes.\"",
      "\"I love getting feedback. Like, one of my favorite things\u2026\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she encourages everyone to voice their opinions and share suggestions.",
      "\"At the heart of what 23andMe does\u2026we're about consumer empowerment and research. Okay.\u00a0 So help me navigate because this has never been done before. So I love getting feedback for all those reasons because it has never been done before,\" Wojcicki explained. \"We're doing all kinds of things for the first time. So we will make mistakes. 100% admit all of that. But\u2026my commitment to the world has always been I will always learn from my mistakes. I will make them, and I will learn from them, and we will be better going forward.\"",
      "Wojcicki sent \"CBS Mornings\" emails she says the company received in support of 23andMe, including one from 70-year-old Rebecca Jones who thanked the company for helping her learn about her increased risk for Alzheimer's. Wojcicki said stories like these show the company provides real value.",
      "When asked by \"CBS Mornings\" if she was concerned about her data following the 2023 security incident at the company, Jones said, \"I have to have some level of confidence in the integrity of 23andMe, like I trust my physician. I have to trust that they are going to safeguard it. Of course I'm concerned and am watching it and will see if there are any steps I should take. I downloaded my data and all of that.\"",
      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",
      "\"I think market cap and reality of a company are always two different realities,\" Wojcicki said. \"We absolutely are in a situation where we're figuring out cash burn and we're looking at all the ways that we're gonna drive revenue growth.\"",
      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health. With a premium membership, customers get health and ancestry kits, discover things like their historical matches, receive new research reports on health findings - such as new breast cancer variants - and more.",
      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore. So we will be focusing on \u2013 you know, the consumer business, the subscription, and research partnerships. And I absolutely think, like, 23andMe will, you know, turn a point at some point of being profitable,\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she's confident that in 2025, the company will be \"growing and thriving.\" In five years, it \"will transform health care,\" she told King.",

    "summary": "The cartel allegedly uses fishing boats to smuggle drugs and migrants \u2014 and catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species.",
    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a\u00a0timeshare fraud\u00a0ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",
      "The month before that, U.S. officials announced economic sanctions against eight targets affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, accused of fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling. Among the leaders targeted was an alleged assassin named Uriel Tabares Martinez.\u00a0 According to the Treasury Department, he is known as \"El Medico\" (\"The Doctor\") for the violent and surgical manner in which he\u00a0tortures\u00a0and kills those who cross the high-ranking members of the cartel.",

      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",

      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call.

      "Walmart's decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies nationwide is designed to \"ensure every customer, every associate\" feels welcome and like they belong, according to John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S.",
      "\"Like many companies all across the United States, we've been on a journey and we continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",
      "Furner said Walmart is undergoing the changes to help foster inclusion.",
      "\"We're going to continue to make the best decisions we can that makes everyone \u2013 our customers, our associates \u2013 feel like this is an environment they can shop in and thrive in,\" he said.",
      "Even so, Walmart's decision comes amid growing pressure from conservatives to halt corporate DEI policies, which ramped up after the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023\u00a0ending affirmative action in college admissions. Some conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace DEI initiatives as well as hiring practices that give boosts to historically marginalized groups.",
      "Other corporations that have recently backed away from DEI policies include\u00a0Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson.",
      "When asked if diversity among suppliers remains important to Walmart, Furner turned the focus to small businesses and small suppliers.",
      "\"We'll continue to do the things we can do to ensure small suppliers have a path to be successful,\" he said, noting that Walmart started in 1962 as a single store in Rogers, Arkansas.",
      "Walmart is also committed to selling American-made goods, which make up about two-thirds of what the company sells, Furner said, adding, \"We're going to continue to lean into ensuring that we provide the very best pathways for small businesses, our supplies to be successful here in the store.\"",
      "How Walmart's preparing for Trump's proposed tariffs",
      "Walmart will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump's new trade policies, as the retailer's products are mostly made within the U.S., Furner said. Even so, he acknowledged customers may see some impact on prices.",
      "On Monday, Trump doubled down on his campaign promise, threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 America's top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data \u2013 \u00a0as one of his \"many first Executive Orders.\"",
      "Trump said he plans to add a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which he described as part of his crackdown on drugs and immigration.

      "\"We'll adjust to any environment. We've been in an environment with tariffs now for the last seven years,\" Furner said, adding that they have a team of people who are responsible for managing changes in trade policy.",

      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

    "story": [
      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it's been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \"belonging.\" It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",
      "Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream.",

      "He filed a workers' compensation claim for his injuries, and was instructed by doctors not to push, pull or lift anything over 10 pounds, as well as to stop driving a commercial vehicle. Walmart failed to accommodate these work restrictions, the lawsuit alleges.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:01:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most Americans are forced to retire earlier than they had expected, often disrupting their financial planning.",
    "story": [
      "The typical American retires far earlier than he or she expects to, and it's often not by choice, according to new research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",
      "The median retirement age in the U.S. is 62, with nearly six in 10 retirees telling the research firm that they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned. Almost half of those people said the reason came down to health issues, such as physical limitations or disability. Losing a job or an organizational change at their employer were among the other reasons people stopped working before they planned to retire.",
      "\"Financially precarious\"",
      "The findings underscore the fragility of retirement in the U.S., with older Americans often finding themselves retired before they're financially ready to call it quits. And with many people outliving earlier generations \u2014 the typical respondent told Transamerica they believe they'll live to age 90 \u2014 they're also facing the prospect of supporting themselves financially for several decades in retirement, which can easily stretch or even exhaust their savings.",
      "\"Many of them are financially precarious \u2014 if they were to have some sort of major financial shock or their health would decline and needed long-term care, they would have a hard time affording it,\" Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The research backs up previous research about the typical retirement age, with the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute finding earlier this year that the median retirement age for Americans is 62. That underscores a gap between retirement plans and reality, with business leaders and policy experts often urging Americans to work longer so they can save more for their old age \u2014 a strategy that often doesn't unfold as envisioned.",
      "Retirees forced to leave their jobs earlier than planned is a \"cautionary tale for people currently in the workforce,\" Collinson said.",
      "People should actively maintain their health and keep their skills up to date, while also educating themselves about retirement and financial planning, as well as socking away savings, she noted.",
      "Why Americans claim Social Security early",
      "Retiring before a person expects may explain why millions of Americans claim Social Security before they reach their \"full retirement age,\" or the age at which they are entitled to their full benefits.",
      "Retirement experts generally urge Americans to hold off on claiming Social Security as long as possible because of the financial benefits of waiting. Workers can file for the retirement benefit as early as age 62, but the tradeoff is a roughly 30%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in their monthly checks compared with waiting until full retirement age, which is either 66 or 67 depending on one's birth year.",
      "But the median age when Americans claim Social Security benefits is 63, Transamerica found in its survey of more than 2,400 retirees. That means many older Americans are locking themselves into permanently lower monthly checks throughout their retirement.",
      "On the flip side, waiting until age 70 to collect Social Security \u2014 the maximum age to claim benefits \u2014 provides a boost of more than 30% to one's monthly benefits. Despite that incentive, Transamerica found that only 4% of retirees wait until 70 to file for their benefits.",
      "\"One of the most important things they can do is fully understand their benefits, and if they have any options to stretch out those benefits,\" Collinson said. \"If it's a spousal situation, maybe if they need the income, one claims first and the other later, or if they can jump back in the workforce and hit the pause button on Social Security and get more income.\"",
      "Another reason for claiming Social Security early is likely that many retirees may not have enough money put away in a retirement fund to keep them afloat. Only about half of U.S. retirees participated in a 401(k) or similar plan throughout their working careers, while more than one in four said their employer never offered retirement benefits while they worked, Transamerica found.",
      "About 6 in 10 retirees cited Social Security as their primary source of income, underscoring the importance of the program for older Americans. By comparison, only about 1 in 10 said retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs would be their main source of income.",
      "Challenged but happy",
      "Despite the challenges, many retirees are sanguine about stepping back from work, the study found. Almost 9 in 10 described themselves as being generally happy and having close relationships with family and friends.",
      "\"One of the things that stands out is retirees are really enjoying their time in retirement, which I think bodes well for all of us,\" Collinson said. \"They've made some adjustments, especially to their financial situation, and overall they are doing well.\"",
      "Americans \"dream of retirement,\" she added. \"Retirement is more about freedom and the ability to spend their time as they want to, rather than it is financial freedom specifically.\"",

    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",

By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is.\"",
      "Illegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.",
      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high last December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified any firm plans to impose new tariffs in their social media messages on Wednesdday. But their implementation could fuel higher prices for American consumers and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20.

President Trump and the entire transition team are grateful for their swift action.\"",
      "Leavitt didn't offer specifics about who was targeted or where, but multiple Trump associates shared that they were targets.",
      "Susie Wiles, Trump's incoming chief of staff, and Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general whom Trump has chosen to be the next U.S. attorney general, were targeted in this wave of attacks, according to a senior law enforcement official. Rep.\u00a0Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to be the\u00a0U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was targeted with a bomb threat to her New York home, her office said.",

      "\"This morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three year old son were driving home to Saratoga County from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence,\" Stefanik's office said in a statement Wednesday morning. \"New York State, County law enforcement, and U.S. Capitol Police responded immediately with the highest levels of professionalism. We are incredibly appreciative of the extraordinary dedication of law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe 24/7. We want to share our best wishes to the Upstate NY community for a happy and safe Thanksgiving. We are especially grateful to our law enforcement officers and military families who are on duty over the holiday season.\"",
      "The home of Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick to be secretary of commerce who is a transition adviser, was also threatened, according to the New York Police Department. NYPD said a 911 call came in reporting a terrorist bomb threat at his home.",
      "Former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who Trump tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, also said he was targeted.",
      "\"A pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message,\" Lee said in a post on X. \"My family and I were not home at the time and are safe. We are working with law enforcement to learn more as this situation develops. We are thankful for the swift actions taken by local officers to keep our family, neighbors, and local community secure.\"",
      "Brooke Rollins, Trump's pick to be secretary of agriculture, also said a \"threat was issued\" against her home and family, and thanked the Fort Worth, Texas, police department for their help. She said she and her family were unharmed, and returned home quickly.",

      "U.S. Capitol Police didn't address specific reports, but said they work closely with law enforcement in swatting incidents.",
      "\"Anytime a member of Congress is the victim of a 'swatting' incident, we work closely with our local and federal law enforcement partners,\" The U.S. Capitol Police said. \"To protect ongoing investigations and to minimize the risk of copy-cats, we cannot provide more details at this time.\"",

They are stationed there as part of Operation Lone Star, a border mission Abbott launched in March 2021 \u2014 alleging insufficient support from the Biden administration to combat the flow of immigration along the Texas-Mexico border.",
      "Abbott has touted the border mission \u2014 which deployed thousands of police and soldiers and miles of barriers \u2014 as a success, despite testimony before a GOP-led Texas Senate panel earlier this year about low morale among troops, humanitarian concerns and ballooning costs. Additionally, the Biden Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union have sued Texas, arguing the law interferes with the federal government's authority over immigration.",
      "Homan on Tuesday vowed to \"help Abbott finish the job he started\" when Trump takes office.",

He outlined last month some of how he plans to carry out the deportations to \"60 Minutes,\" saying it will be \"targeted arrests,\" although he said there would not be a \"mass sweep of neighborhoods.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez asked a federal court in New York on Wednesday to throw out his conviction in a sprawling bribery scheme and grant him a new trial after prosecutors disclosed that the jury was inadvertently provided information during deliberations that it should not have been given.",
      "The request from Menendez's lawyers came in response to a letter prosecutors sent to the court on Nov. 13 revealing they had unintentionally loaded onto a laptop given to the jury during deliberations the incorrect versions of nine exhibits. Prosecutors said neither they nor Menendez's lawyers, who inspected the exhibits on the laptop, noticed the error at the time.",
      "Government lawyers told U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein that they did not believe the inclusion of the nine exhibits warranted upsetting Menendez's guilty verdict, in part because \"there is no reasonable likelihood any juror ever saw any of the erroneously less-redacted versions.\" But Menendez's lawyers told Stein in a separate filing that the improper disclosure was a \"serious breach\" by prosecutors and said a new trial was \"unavoidable.\"",
      "The exhibits, they said, \"exposed the jury to a theory of criminality that the government was barred from presenting under the Speech or Debate Clause \u2014 namely, that Senator Menendez made specific decisions with respect to military sales to Egypt in exchange for bribes.\"",
      "Under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, senators or House members \"shall not be questioned\" for \"any speech or debate\" in either chamber of Congress. Stein had ruled that certain material referencing arms sales and military aid to Egypt were legislative acts shielded by the clause.",
      "Menendez's defense team said the information disclosed to the jury contained the only evidence that tied him to the provision of military aid to Egypt, which was at the center of the bribery scheme the New Jersey Democrat was accused of engaging in.",
      "They also lambasted prosecutors for attempting to \"shift the blame,\" calling it \"factually and legally outrageous.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the court had \"expressly prohibited\" evidence of past legislative activity, including actions Menendez allegedly took as a senator about foreign aid to Egypt, and said the evidence at issue \"squarely crossed that line \u2026 and allowed the jury to infer bribery from Senator Menendez's legislative acts \u2014 exactly what the Speech or Debate Clause is meant to prevent.\"",
      "Prosecutors claimed that Menendez helped orchestrate a corrupt agreement through which he would work to secretly benefit the Egyptian government in exchange for lavish gifts including cash, gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, furniture and mortgage payments from three New Jersey businessmen.",
      "He was convicted on 16 felony counts in July, including bribery, fraud and acting as a foreign agent.",
      "Menendez's two co-defendants in the case, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, also separately asked the court to grant them new trials and toss out their convictions.",
      "Menendez faced immense pressure to resign after he was indicted on federal bribery charges last year but resisted doing so until he was convicted. He stepped down from the Senate in August, a stunning capstone to a lengthy career in the upper chamber that included a position atop the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",

The Trump team announced Tuesday that it has signed the White House agreement.",
      "\"After completing the selection process of his incoming Cabinet, President-elect Trump is entering the next phase of his administration's transition by executing a Memorandum of Understanding with President Joe Biden's White House,\" said incoming Trump White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. \"This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.\"",
      "Signing the White House agreement allows authorized members of Trump's team to access White House and agency facilities, information and employees.",
      "But since the Trump team is declining to sign a similar agreement with General Services Administration, office space, secure email addresses and funding for transition staffing and other activities will not be provided by GSA, Sharma said. She said the White House will work to protect non-public information and prevent conflicts of interest, despite the lack of a signed memo.",
      "And although White House officials say progress has been made toward a memorandum of understanding between the Trump team and the Justice Department, White House officials say no DOJ agreement has been signed. It's the Justice Department that is responsible for processing requests for security clearances for incoming administration officials who will need access to briefing materials and national security information, and those clearances cannot happen without a signed memorandum of understanding between the Trump transition team and the Justice Department.",
      "The Justice Department, not the White House or General Services Administration, is responsible for security clearances for transition personnel.",
      "\"To date, the DOJ MOU is not signed but progress has been made towards an agreement,\" a Justice Department spokesperson said. \"The Department of Justice is ready to process requests for security clearances for those who will need access briefing materials and national security information once the MOU is signed, which we hope will happen very soon.\"",
      "Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center who focuses on presidential transitions, said the terms of the memo of understanding outlined Wiles reflect, in her assessment, an effort from the Trump transition team to shield themselves from transparency.",
      "\"They're sort of making it up as they go, because it's never been done like this before,\" she said.",
      "What could Trump's second term bring? Deportations, tariffs, Jan. 6 pardons and more",
      "What could Trump's second term bring? Deportations, tariffs, Jan. 6 pardons and more",
      "While Wiles has suggested not signing the General Services Administration document saves taxpayer money, using taxpayer money comes with strings attached \u2014 specifically, more requirements for transparency and documentation, Dunn Tenpas said.",
      "\"If you take government resources, the memorandum with GSA requires that you then have to report all donations to the transition, and they cannot exceed $5,000 per person,\" she said. \"It's two things: One, they want the privacy of who their donors are and if they don't accept the GSA money, they don't have to disclose anything \u2014 and secondly, they have a few supporters, like Miriam Adelson and Elon Musk that are billionaires... So this notion of getting $7 million from the government to help jump-start your transition just isn't as attractive as it might have been to the Harris campaign, but I think more importantly, they probably don't want people to know that so-and-so gave $2 billion to the transition.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "A California man who prosecutors alleged lied to federal agents and pushed fake criminal allegations against President Biden and his son Hunter now faces new charges of tax evasion from special counsel David Weiss, according to court records.",
      "Alexander Smirnov was an FBI informant for about a decade, providing information to federal investigators in what his defense attorneys claimed in court filings demonstrated an \"undivided, years-long loyalty to the United States.\"",
      "But Weiss \u2014 the Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. attorney who was kept on during the Biden administration and later elevated to the role of special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to continue the Hunter Biden probes \u2014 alleged in a February 2024 indictment that Smirnov illegally made false claims to FBI handlers about Hunter and Mr. Biden that dated back to 2020.",
      "Smirnov was accused of lying to investigators when he told them the two Bidens had each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",
      "Smirnov, who court records say was born in Ukraine, pleaded not guilty to the charges and in court filings, his defense team has accused prosecutors of charging their client \"as a result of the rejection of Hunter Biden's plea resolutions.\" He remains in pretrial detention pending trial.",
      "On Nov. 21, just weeks before he was set to go to trial on Dec. 3, federal prosecutors in Weiss' office filed a little-noticed indictment in a separate case against Smirnov, alleging he had illegally concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in income between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Court records alleged Smirnov spent unreported income on a Las Vegas apartment, a Bentley and payments on credit card debt. Prosecutors did not name the alleged source of the funds, but the dates and amounts of his payments to him from a single company identified in their filing as \"Company 1\" coincide with payments they alleged Smirnov received from the Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation, which was named in court records filed in Smirnov's other case. The new charges do not indicate any wrongdoing by Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation. Other income came from an unnamed individual, the new indictment said.",
      "\"In order to conceal the millions of dollars he received in income in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Defendant created and filed false Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns, for himself and in Domestic Partner's name that included false and fictitious income and expenses,\" the 27-page indictment filed last week said.",
      "According to newly published court records, the judge overseeing Weiss' first case against Smirnov \u2014 District Court Judge Otis Wright \u2014 held a status conference on Tuesday and delayed his upcoming trial on the false statements charges until January.",
      "Responding to the new tax charges, David Chesnoff, Smirnov's attorney, told CBS News, \"Mr. Smirnov intends to vigorously defend this case as he is vigorously defending the first case.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Weiss declined to comment when contacted by CBS News.",
      "Prosecutors alleged earlier this year that Smirnov's false claims against the Bidens were memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD 1023. Congressional Republicans previously pointed to that document's allegations of bribery as evidence of misdeeds and fought with the FBI to publicly release the document, which investigators now say contained fake allegations.",
      "Smirnov's attorneys have argued in court records that the case \"smacks of political bias.\" But prosecutors pushed back, writing this month that Smirnov, \"has never provided any discovery to the government or evidence to this Court supporting his baseless claims\u2014indeed, there is no such evidence because the claims are meritless.\"",
      "In court records filed earlier this year, the special counsel said Smirnov told the FBI about contacts with foreign intelligence officials, \"including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently.\" Defense attorneys in court filings of their own called allegations of Russian ties baseless.",
      "Apart from the specific charges at issue, law enforcement experts told CBS News earlier this year that the mounting questions about Smirnov's truthfulness should trigger an audit of every case in which he was involved. A CBS News investigation published earlier this year revealed that serious doubts about Smirnov's credibility were raised almost a decade ago.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the results of the CBS News investigation earlier this year.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:13:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal appeals court to dismiss his appeal in the documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 A federal appeals court on Tuesday granted special counsel Jack Smith's bid to end the case against President-elect Donald Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents, effectively bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented case against the nation's former and next president.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit said in a brief order that it had granted Smith's request to dismiss the appeal as to Trump. The special counsel had asked the Atlanta-based court on Monday to drop his effort to revive\u00a0the case, citing Trump's recent victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election and longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The district court judge presiding over Trump's case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, had ruled earlier this year that the charges should be dismissed because Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision, but asked the 11th Circuit to dismiss his appeal.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law,\" Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement in response to Smith's request. \"The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "In his brief filing\u00a0with the 11th Circuit, Smith cited a separate request to dismiss his other case involving Trump, which involves an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel said in that filing submitted to a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case agreed to drop the charges against Trump just hours after Smith filed his request, marking the culmination of that monthslong prosecution against the president-elect. In the documents case, dismissing the appeal as to Trump leaves in place the lower court's order tossing out the charges against him. The appeal will continue as to Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, because unlike the president-elect, \"no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" Smith wrote.",
      "\"The special counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,\" John Irving, de Oliveira's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment.",
      "Trump became the first former president to face federal charges when a grand jury returned an indictment against him in June 2023. The prosecution came months after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search of Trump's South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 and recovered more than 100 documents marked classified that he kept after his first term ended in January 2021.",
      "Following the search, Trump mounted a separate legal battle that brought the appointment of an independent arbiter to sift through the material seized by the FBI, though the 11th Circuit ordered an end to that review in late 2022.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November of that year to take over the federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records and pursued charges against the president-elect for unlawfully retaining national defense information and attempting to obstruct the Justice Department's probe. Trump was charged alongside two employees, Nauta, an aide, and de Oliveira, the property manager as Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Trump, Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect claimed his prosecution was a politically motivated attempt to harm his candidacy in the race for a second term.",
      "Prosecutors used court filings to reveal information about how Trump allegedly stored records containing the nation's secrets at his resort, as well as how he, with his co-defendants, allegedly engaged in a scheme to deceive federal investigators and stymie their probe.",
      "They included photos showing boxes of material stacked on the stage in Mar-a-Lago's ballroom and in a bathroom on the property. Other images taken by the FBI during its August 2022 search show boxes of records in a storage room and in Trump's office, some of which prosecutors said contained highly sensitive information alongside personal keepsakes and other items from his presidency.",
      "Cannon initially set a trial date for May 20, 2024, but she postponed the proceedings weeks before they were set to begin.",
      "The president-elect and his lawyers attempted to have the case against him dismissed on a variety of grounds, claiming he was selectively prosecuted, he was shielded from federal charges by presidential immunity and Smith was appointed in violation of the Constitution.",
      "Trump succeeded in persuading Cannon that the special counsel's appointment and funding for his office were unlawful, and she ordered the case to be dismissed in July.",
      "But Smith appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit. Both he and Trump's lawyers submitted filings with the court presenting their views on Cannon's ruling, though the court had not yet set a date for arguments. It was expected that an eventual decision from the 11th Circuit would wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "The documents case was one of two that Smith brought against Trump. In Washington, he faced charges related to an alleged attempt to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. The president-elect pleaded not guilty to the four counts he faced there, and the dispute landed before the Supreme Court as Trump argued presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",
      "He was also charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed.",
      "The Fulton County case involved an alleged plot by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. He pleaded not guilty to charges in the sprawling racketeering case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis. Proceedings had been halted, though, while a state appeals court considered whether Willis should be disqualified from the case. It's unclear how Trump's victory will affect his prosecution in Fulton County.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, Smith has sought to end both of the historic prosecutions of the former and next president.",
      "With both cases settled, Smith is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland has pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so for Smith's report, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress after submitting their reports, and Smith could as well.",
      "Should the disclosure of Smith's findings stall and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its release become increasingly slim as the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",

    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

    "summary": "Walmart is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations doing the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it's been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \"belonging.\" It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",
      "Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream.",

    "title": "No-fault divorce advocates start to fret as talk of banning it bubbles up",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 07:31:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Warnings have been popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still have the option of no-fault divorce.",
    "story": [
      "Married couples across the U.S. have had access to no-fault divorce for more than 50 years, an option many call crucial to supporting domestic abuse victims and key to preventing already crowded family courts from drowning in complicated divorce proceedings.",
      "But some advocates for women worried as old comments from now Vice President-elect JD Vance circulated during the presidential campaign opposing no-fault divorce. And after President-elect Donald Trump and Vance won the election, warnings began popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still could. Some attorneys posted saying they were seeing a spike in calls from women seeking divorce consultations.",
      "Trump - who is twice-divorced - hasn't championed overhauling the country's divorce laws, but in 2021 Vance lamented that divorce is too easily accessible. Conservative podcasters and others have, as well.",
      "\"We've run this experiment in real time and what we have is a lot of very, very real family dysfunction that's making our kids unhappy,\" Vance said during a speech  at a Christian high school in California, where he criticized people being able to \"shift spouses like they change their underwear.\"",
      "Despite concerns, even those who want to make divorces harder to get say they don't expect big, swift changes. There is no national coordinated effort underway. And states determine their own divorce laws, so national leaders can't change policy.",
      "\"Even in some of the so-called red states, it hasn't gotten anywhere,\" said Beverly Willett, co-chair of the Coalition for Divorce Reform, whose group has unsuccessfully attempted to get states to repeal their no-fault divorce laws.",
      "Mark A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Washington, said that while many Americans have become accustomed to no-fault divorce being an option, Vance's previous comments on making it more difficult to separate from a spouse could help jumpstart that effort.",
      "\"Even though he's not directly proposing a policy, it's a topic that hasn't gotten a ton of discussion in the last 15 years,\" Smith said. \"And so to have a national profile politician talk that way is noteworthy.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Party platforms in Texas and Nebraska were amended in 2022 to call for the removal of no-fault divorce. Louisiana's Republican Party considered something similar earlier this year but ultimately declined to do so.",
      "A handful of proposals have been introduced in conservative-led statehouses over the years, but all immediately stalled after they were filed.",
      "In January, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers introduced legislation that would have kept married couples from filing for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility. Deevers backed the bill after writing a piece declaring no-fault divorce was an \"abolition of marital obligation.\"",
      "Similarly, in South Carolina, two Republican lawmakers in 2023 filed a bill that would have required both spouses to file for a no-fault divorce application rather than just one. And in South Dakota, a Republican lawmaker has attempted to remove irreconcilable difference as grounds for divorce since 2020.",
      "None of the sponsors of these bills responded to interview requests from The Associated Press. All are members of their state's conservative Freedom Caucus.",
      "Alarms sounded",
      "Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers say they remain worried about the future of no-fault divorce. They point to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 as an example of a long-accepted option that was revoked through a decades-long effort.",
      "\"When you choose to be silent, you allow for this to creep in,\" said Democratic South Dakota Rep. Linda Duba. \"These are the bills that gain a foothold because you choose to be silent.\"",
      "Before California became the first state to adopt a no-fault divorce option in 1969, married couples had to prove their spouse had violated one of the approved \"faults\" outlined in their state's divorce law or risk a judge denying their divorce, said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Qualified reasons varied from state to state, but largely included infidelity, incarceration or abandonment.",
      "The system was a particular burden on domestic violence victims, often times women, who could be stuck in dangerous marriages while trying to prove their partner's abuse in court through expensive and lengthy legal proceedings.",
      "\"(Even) if there was any evidence that the couple both wanted to get divorced, that was supposed to be denied because divorce was not something you got because you wanted it, it was something you got because you've been wronged in a way that the state thought was significant,\" Grossman said.",
      "\"Extremely worried\"",
      "To date, every state in the U.S. has adopted a no-fault divorce option. However, 33 states still have a list of approved \"faults\" to file as grounds for divorce - ranging from adultery to felony conviction. In 17 states, married people only have the option of choosing no-fault divorce to end their marriages.",
      "Calls to reform no-fault divorce have remained fairly silent until the late 1990s, when concern pushed by former President George Bush's administration over the country's divorce rate sparked a brief movement for states to adopt \"covenant marriages.\" The option didn't replace a state's no-fault divorce law, but provided an option for couples that carried counseling requirements and strict exceptions for divorce.",
      "Louisiana was the first state to embrace covenant marriage options, but the effort largely stopped after Arizona and Arkansas followed suit.",
      "Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, said she is \"extremely worried\" about the possibility of no-fault divorce being removed with the incoming Trump administration, Republican-controlled Congress and wide range of conservative state leaders.",
      "\"With so many states focusing on a misogynistic legislative agenda, this will turn back the clocks on women's rights even more,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"This is why removing 'no fault' divorce is another way for the government to control women, their bodies, and their lives. Eliminating no-fault divorce is also a backdoor way of eliminating gay marriage, since this implies that a marriage is only between a man and a woman.\"",
      "With Trump's reelection, Willett, whose group opposes no-fault divorce, said she's cautiously optimistic that the political tide could change.",
      "\"Was what he said an indication of things to come? I don't know,\" Willett said. \"It's a good thing but it's certainly not anything that has been really discussed other than a few high profile conservatives who talk about it.\""

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:22:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge to toss out the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the case stemming from the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump agreed to dismiss the charges following a request from special counsel Jack Smith, bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented prosecution of the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's request just hours after he said in a filing that he is seeking to close Trump's case because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"After careful consideration, the department has determined that [the Office of Legal Counsel's] prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" Smith wrote\u00a0in his filing. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\"",
      "The special counsel noted the historic nature of Trump's prosecution and subsequent election to the presidency, writing that the \"department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president.\"",
      "But after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the special counsel said \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith said in his six-page motion that he conferred with Trump's lawyers, and they did not object to the request to drop the case. The special counse sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029.",
      "Chutkan said in a brief opinion that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" in part because it is \"consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\"",
      "In response to Smith's request to drop the charges, Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement, \"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "The judge's approval of Smith's request to dismiss the case and toss the four federal counts against the president-elect was expected. The special counsel is also likely to submit a final report to the attorney general and resign before Trump takes office. Smith's request was not a surprise, as he and the Justice Department were in talks about how to wind down the prosecution after Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month. The special counsel consulted with Attorney General Merrick Garland about the decision to drop the case.",
      "Smith was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after Trump announced his third run for the White House. He took over two ongoing federal probes into Trump's conduct, one focused on his alleged mishandling of classified records and the other tied to the 2020 election.",
      "After a monthslong grand jury investigation, Smith obtained a four-count indictment against Trump that alleged he sought to resist the peaceful transfer of power following Joe Biden's electoral victory and allegedly engaged in a criminal scheme in the process. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment laid out a sprawling scheme in which prosecutors accused Trump and his unnamed co-conspirators of working to undermine the legitimacy of the election results and halt the certification of the Electoral College votes in a bid to stay in power.",
      "Trump's legal team successfully delayed the case well into this year after they claimed Trump was immune from prosecution because he was president at the time the alleged conduct took place. Chutkan and a D.C. appeals court panel rejected the argument of presidential immunity. The case was put on hold as the Supreme Court then took up the matter.",
      "Ultimately, the high court issued a landmark decision in the case, ruling in July that presidents are immune from federal criminal prosecution for actions taken in their official capacity as president of the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts allowed for charges to be filed when a president acted in an unofficial or personal capacity.",
      "Some of the alleged conduct included in Smith's 2023 indictment was disqualified from the case and the special counsel later secured a superseding indictment against Trump in an attempt to contour the charges to the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump pleaded not guilty to the new indictment earlier in September.",
      "Before Smith asked her to dismiss the case, Chutkan was in the midst of applying the Supreme Court's immunity decision to the case. In October, she made public a key filing from Smith that provided a comprehensive look at the evidence prosecutors amassed in their case against Trump. The special counsel and his team said that when he lost the 2020 race, Trump \"resorted to crimes\" to hold onto power.",
      "The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the results of the 2020 election well before Election Day and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol, where Congress had convened to tally state electoral votes. A mob of Trump's supporters breached the building, leading to the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Smith's filing to dismiss the charges.",
      "\"I'd refer you to the Department of Justice, and I would just underline that the president is proud to have restored the independence of the Department of Justice when it comes to critical matters \u2014 criminal matters,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.",
      "The special counsel made a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where judges were considering whether Smith's other case against Trump \u2014 dealing with classified documents \u2014 should be revived after a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith was unlawfully appointed to the role of special counsel by Garland and as a result, the case against Trump was invalid. The Justice Department appealed her ruling.",
      "In addition to the two federal cases, Trump was charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed following the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him in the sprawling racketeering case in Fulton County, which is related to an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, with both of Smith's cases closer to being settled, he is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so in the Smith cases, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress about their reports, and Smith could, as well.",
      "Should the public release of Smith's report stall for any reason and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its disclosure become increasingly slim, since the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and other matters in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",
      "He has also selected D. John Sauer to serve as solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court. Sauer argued the immunity case on behalf of Trump in April.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 23:21:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans vying for jobs allege Trump transition aide Boris Epshteyn has been mixing private consulting with his transition role.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is grappling with internal strife over the alleged conduct of a senior and longtime adviser, Boris Epshteyn, who has been accused by at least one Republican politician of trying to profit personally from his ability to influence Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens submitted a sworn declaration to the transition team alleging that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with an internal investigation that is being conducted by David Warrington, who served as general counsel to the Trump campaign. According to Parlatore, Warrington interviewed Greitens about his interaction with Epshteyn late last week and then asked Greitens to submit the declaration. Warrington has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"It was important to me to protect the president because I was concerned about the ethics of what was happening,\" Greitens told CBS News. \"Very specifically, I was concerned that there was an offer to advance a nomination in return for financial payments.\"",
      "Epshteyn told CBS News he is \"honored to work for President Trump and with his team.\"",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue,\u00a0as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",
      "Epshteyn has been a near-constant figure by Trump's side in recent years, buoying him on air and helping to coordinate his multiple legal teams behind closed doors. Those teams have had unquestionable success, impeding Trump's two federal criminal cases before they could get to trial, and stymying a state case against Trump in Georgia. Trump was convicted in the one case that went to trial, in New York, but recently the sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely. On Monday, special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal district court to dismiss the charges against Trump stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and he also sought to end his bid to revive the case against Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.",
      "A native of Russia who emigrated to New Jersey with his family when he was 11, Epshteyn was brought into the Trump sphere by Georgetown University classmate Eric Trump. He started as a low-level staffer during Trump's first run for office and was able to parlay that into a junior position on the White House communications team. Two months later he abruptly resigned over circumstances that remain unclear, but by then he had managed to win over Trump as his loyal confidant and fixer.",
      "Eric Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview that \"I've known Boris for years, and I've never known him to be anything but a good human being.\" But he implied the allegations could have consequences for Epshteyn.",
      "\"I certainly hope the reporting is false and I can also tell you if it's true, you know, the person will probably no longer be around,\" Eric Trump said.",
      "Epshteyn supporters praise his ability to execute orders and resolve problems, which they attribute to a frenetic energy, his bulldog personality and a cunning understanding of the political dynamics of Trump's advisers. Epshteyn has become so close to Trump that the president-elect jokingly refers to Epshteyn as \"my psychiatrist,\" The New York Times first noted. According to multiple sources, Epshteyn's access to Trump is at times only rivaled by family members.",
      "In the weeks since Trump won his second term as president, Epshteyn has been a mainstay in discussions about filling out the Cabinet. The New York Times reported Epshteyn played a critical role in recommending former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, a bid that ultimately failed to win favor and was withdrawn.",
      "The status of Epshteyn's consulting business while assisting in the transition is unclear. But prior to the 2024 election, the business appeared to be robust. A review of publicly available records indicate his firm has been paid more than $1 million from Trump's campaigns and aligned PACs since 2020, and another $1.2 million by other campaigns.",
      "While there is nothing new about political consultants \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 using their connections, interviews with about two dozen advisers, lawyers and allies of Trump reveal Epshteyn's political consulting work has bred both praise and resentment.",
      "CBS News spoke with more than half a dozen Republican candidates who have engaged with Epshteyn. Many described his pitch, offering an array of services, including \"strategic advice\" on messaging and boosting a candidate's social media presence. But nearly everyone interviewed said his access to Trump had allure.",
      "Ahead in the polls as his Republican Senate primary approached in 2022, Don Bolduc wanted to make sure Trump didn't play spoiler by endorsing one of his New Hampshire rivals. Bolduc said he turned to Epshteyn \"to run interference inside the Trump circle.\"",
      "A service like that doesn't come cheap. \"I thought $100,000 was a lot of money for what we were asking, but that's what was paid,\" said Bolduc, who added \"no guarantee\" was given by Epshteyn that Trump wouldn't endorse a rival.",
      "Bolduc won his primary after Trump stayed neutral. He told CBS News that while it appeared to him that he got what he paid for, the experience left him feeling disillusioned with the transactional side of elections. After the campaign ended in general election defeat, Bolduc said he chose to leave politics for good.",
      "\"There's nothing honorable about politics,\" said Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. After his failed Senate race, Bolduc enrolled in a police academy and became a rookie small-town cop at age 60.",
      "After publication, Rick Wiley, a senior adviser on Bolduc's campaign, told CBS News that Epshteyn \"was retained by General Bolduc's campaign for strategic media consulting with conservative media outlets, and he delivered.\"",
      "Wiley listed three shows that Bolduc appeared on and said they enabled \"his campaign to reach supporters and voters throughout New Hampshire and across the country.\"",
      "Among those who hired Epshteyn for his campaign services in the past was Greitens, who served as Missouri governor during a portion of the first Trump term. In the weeks since Trump won reelection, Greitens said he contacted Epshteyn for assistance to be considered for an appointment as U.S. Navy secretary.",
      "\"During the conversation, despite the absence of an explicit offer, Mr. Epshteyn's comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in a subsequent discussion,\" Greitens wrote. \"He stated that there would be 'time for that later' and that it was 'not time for that yet.'\"",
      "\"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President,\" Greitens wrote. \"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:26:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump, who ran on mass deportation and harsher immigration policies, could inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month. The agency has been averaging roughly 1,550 apprehensions between legal border entry points each day so far in November, according to the internal data.",
      "While U.S. officials had been worried about a spike in migrant crossings after President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election, due to his promises to seal the southern border, that has not materialized \u2014 at least not yet. In fact, illegal border crossings dropped slightly after Election Day.",
      "If the trend holds, illegal border crossings in November will be below the 54,000 apprehensions logged by Border Patrol in September, the current Biden-era low. The last time illegal border crossings were lower was in the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced migration.",
      "Spikes in migrants journeying to the U.S. border have bedeviled Republican and Democratic presidents alike. But migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under Mr. Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December. The Trump-era monthly high was 133,000 in May 2019.",
      "The current four-year-low in illegal immigration reflects a broader decrease that began earlier this year and that has been mainly attributed to efforts by the Mexican government to stop migrants from reaching American soil and asylum restrictions enacted by President Biden in June.",
      "That stringent asylum policy has dramatically cut the number of migrants released into the U.S. and allowed to apply for legal protection, government statistics show.",
      "Trump has vowed to enact even stricter measures, promising to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history and dismantle Biden administration programs that allow certain migrants to enter the country legally. Under one of those policies, the U.S. is currently processing about 40,000 migrants each month at official border crossings after they secure appointments through a smartphone app.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas argued the Biden administration built a new border policy \"model\" that both enforces U.S. law and adheres to the country's values.",
      "\"Through tough measures at our border, newly-built capabilities to remove people more quickly, the construction of lawful pathways that enable people to obtain relief in a safe and orderly way, and an unprecedented attack on the smuggling organizations, we have driven border encounters below their 2019 level, made the border more secure than it was then, and upheld our standing as a country of refuge for those who qualify under the law,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The \"ultimate irony\"",
      "Trump made the situation at the border under Mr. Biden central to his campaign, and his hardline immigration proposals resonated with many voters. Mass deportation, for example, continues to enjoy support from a majority of Americans, CBS News polling shows. But Trump could very well inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
      "\"It is an ultimate irony, and it is going to put Trump in a position of declaring victory,\" said Doris Meissner, who led the now-defunct Immigration Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration and currently serves as a senior fellow at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.",
      "The lull at the border, should it persist, could allow the incoming Trump administration to focus limited immigration enforcement resources in the interior of the country, to carry out the president-elect's mass deportation plan, which faces formidable logistical hurdles.",
      "With roughly 6,000 law enforcement officers and 41,000 detention beds, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch currently lacks the manpower and resources to arrest, detain and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants Trump and his allies have promised to expel from the country.",
      "Trump's top advisers have floated proposals to tap into the Department of Defense's vast resources, including by using military planes for deportations and tasking National Guard soldiers with carrying out immigration arrests. But the feasibility \u2014 and legality \u2014 of those plans remain open questions.",
      "Meissner said the relative calm at the southern border could allow Trump's administration to redirect Border Patrol resources towards interior immigration enforcement. But she warned that the lull in illegal border crossings could be disrupted if Mexican enforcement eases or if programs that discourage migrants from crossing the border illegally by offering them a legal path to enter the U.S. are terminated.",
      "\"There is a formula right now that even though it's fragile, is working,\" Meissner said. \"The Trump administration is very disruptor oriented, and it could actually find itself having more of a problem than is now the case at the border.\"",

      "President Biden pardoned two turkeys from Minnesota on Monday, in keeping with the annual White House turkey pardon tradition.",
      "It was Mr. Biden's final turkey pardon as president, before President-elect Donald Trump is tasked with keeping up the tradition. This year's turkeys, Peach and Blossom, are named after the Delaware state flower, the peach blossom, which symbolizes resilience, Mr. Biden said. The president joked that the more than 2,000 people who gathered for the event were there seeking a pardon, as he has less than two months in office.",
      "\"In the last four years, I've had the honor to continue that tradition by pardoning Peanut Butter and Jelly, Chocolate and Chip, Liberty and Bell,\" Mr. Biden told the crowd on the White House South Lawn, with the turkeys gobbling occasionally in the background. \"And today, Peach and Blossom will join the free birds of the United States of America.\"",
      "\"Based on your temperament and commitment to being productive members of society, I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom!\" he declared.",
      "But the president took a more serious tone as he concluded his remarks.",
      "\"Let me close on a more serious note\u2014 this event marks the official start of the holiday season here in Washington,\" he said. \"It's also my last time to speak here as your president during the season and give thanks and gratitude. So let me say to you, it's been the honor of my life. I'm forever grateful.\"",

      "The Texan was at the forefront of what helped lead to a dramatic change in this year's presidential election when he urged Mr. Biden to end his reelection bid in July, becoming the first Democrat in Congress to\u00a0publicly break\u00a0with the commander-in-chief after a disastrous summer debate performance against Donald Trump.",
      "In the weeks that followed more than 30 Democrats called on the president to exit the contest, but Mr. Biden's eventual decision to leave the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris failed to stop Trump from winning back the White House, the outcome many in the party feared would come to pass if Mr. Biden had remained at the top of the ticket.",
      "This is the season of second guessing on the left, a time of what-ifs and maybes. Doggett, 78, believes almost everyone holding elected office in his party bears \"some responsibility for the catastrophic defeat\" he says they were handed. In addition to losing the presidency and the Senate, Democrats also failed to take back control of the House from Republicans.",
      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Doggett said. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back and doing all the damage that he will do to our country.\"",
      "Mr. Biden ran for the White House four years ago in an attempt to end Trumpism, touting his wisdom as an experienced political hand who had spent decades in the U.S. Senate and service for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. He'll soon leave office at the age of 82, with his White House tenure wedged between Trump's first and second terms as president and a Republican-led Congress riled by Mr. Biden's tenure leading the nation.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter is going to be very happy now that he wasn't the worst president of my lifetime,\" Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez gloated. \"\u2026.[Biden's] policies got pretty soundly defeated in this last election.\"",
      "As Democrats sort through the aftermath of what went wrong, among those in Congress who helped push him out of the 2024 race, there remains respect for what Biden accomplished.",
      "\"For where America was going at the time, he saved our democracy, at least for four years,\" Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley said.",
      "But hindsight has also brought about the belief that acting sooner might have made a difference.",
      "\"[Harris] ran a pretty good campaign, actually a really good campaign, and she had the disadvantages of not having the time to distance herself from Biden,\" California Rep. Scott Peters said. \"Every campaign you make mistakes. And because she had such a compressed time frame, she didn't really have time to recover from the mistakes. But I thought it was certainly better than the alternative. I think if the president had been on the ticket, it would've just been a slaughter.\"",
      "Back in 2019, Biden said he believed history would look back on four years of President Trump \"and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.\" His campaign carried the implicit hope for Democrats that while Trump may have changed politics for the time being, defeating him would bring back a measure of civility in a nation that increasingly appeared to have long moved past wanting such courtesy.",
      "Now, Trump has found his way back to the White House after trying to overturn his loss in 2020 and spreading falsehoods that the election was stolen, claims that stirred the mob of his supporters who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021 and scarred the normally peaceful transfer of power. He overcame indictments and a group of younger Republican primary challengers. He survived two assassination attempts and won a clear victory this fall, becoming the first man in over a century to be elected to non-consecutive terms as president.",
      "In this last election, many voters sided with a far different vision for America than the one espoused by Mr. Biden. Trump's approach is far more combative, his agenda centered around undocumented immigration and a vow to conduct mass deportations along with moves enticing the far right, like potential pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. He's also promised tariffs and tax changes targeted at Americans' economic concerns.",
      "Before July, Democratic leaders publicly shook off concerns about Mr. Biden's age and ability to win again, choosing instead to overhaul the party's primary process at his own urging, paving the way for him to face little resistance about his decision to run for reelection until after his fateful debate performance.",
      "In his lone White House term, Biden led the nation out of the coronavirus pandemic and worked with Democrats' narrow congressional majorities at the time to pass a $1.9 trillion relief proposal during his first 100 days in office, relying on that same power more than a year later to put in place a landmark plan to fight climate change, both being party-line initiatives praised by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.",
      "He signed into law major bipartisan bills on infrastructure, gun safety and domestic production of semiconductor computer chips. He helped bolster support for Ukraine as it faces Russia's brutal invasion, work that may soon be undercut given that notable Trump administration picks either haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "But inflation troubles drowned out other aspects of Mr. Biden's economic record while the border, immigration, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan were key issues that Biden's presidency struggled with as he asked Democrats to get behind him for another term.",
      "\"Look, there's going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters after the election. \"Very proud of what he's been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed for what the vice president was able to do.\"",
      "A source familiar with the president's standing at the time said internal campaign polling \"showed a slight hit\" from the June 27 debate and contended that \"it wasn't until the circular firing squad picked up and there was regular coverage of Democrats calling for an exit that we really took more damage.\"",
      "Yet among the Democrats who called on him to leave the race before Mr. Biden dropped out on July 21, there is a sense that they were right, that they did what needed to be done even if it didn't get them where they wanted to be.",
      "\"In retrospect, I feel certain that Biden was facing certain defeat and that we were certainly going to see the loss of the House and the Senate, and I felt the House would be much worse than it is now,\" said California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who still regards Biden as having had an \"amazing run as the president.\"",
      "Others didn't share the same introspection.",
      "Even after going public with his call for Biden to end his campaign, Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his own contest, a defeat which helped give Republicans the Senate and unified control of Washington. Reeling from his loss and facing reporters as he hurried through the Capitol a few days after the election, Brown said \"I don't have any thoughts on Biden's legacy.\"",
      "\"I'm just focused on what we need to do here these last few weeks,\" Brown said. \"I'm not a pundit.\"",
      "And the man who defeated Brown didn't hesitate to credit Mr. Biden for helping bring Trump back to power.",
      "\"Biden was the greatest thing to ever happen to President Trump because he showed the country how insane the left has gotten,\" said Bernie Moreno, the Republican who ousted Brown from his Senate seat.",
      "Mr. Biden isn't quite an afterthought in Washington \u2014 however, the spotlight that was so squarely trained on him for most of the last four years has drifted to Trump and the vision his allies on the right have for the president-elect's return to power.",
      "In these waning days of his presidency, Mr. Biden isn't the only one quietly finishing his tenure. Political life in the nation's Capitol rarely ends in climactic fashion, with most leaving the halls of power because of retirement or defeat rather than one final victory before calling it a career.",
      "Like Mr. Biden, Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is a former party standard bearer. And like the president, his political career is coming to an end as a man they both opposed prepares to retake the White House, that \"aberrant moment\" Mr. Biden once described returning for an encore.",

      "The nearby seafood restaurant was so inundated with water from the hurricane floods, Copelof said the owner initially told her, \"I'm not even sure if I should try to rebuild.\"",
      "Brevard was among the dozens of North Carolina communities devastated by Hurricane Helene. But the crisis has morphed in October and November, into a painful and uncertain wait for federal aid that seems to have stalled.",

      "A standoff in Congress has indefinitely delayed efforts to replenish the U.S. Small Business Administration's disaster loan fund, which offers emergency loans to help homeowners and businesses rebuild damaged properties.\u00a0 The loans are also used to help upgrade homes and businesses to prevent against future storm damage.\u00a0 The money can also be used to help offset the loss of sales during business closures.",
      "Despite warnings from the Biden administration that the federal fund for the loans would be fully exhausted by October, Congress departed Washington before Election Day without passing legislation to replenish the fund. And upon its return from its recess last week, the Senate held a hearing to discuss plans for future funding of the loan program. But no legislation has been drafted, nor has a date been set to vote on any measure to restore the money.",
      "\"There's always a concern about Congress moving sluggishly,\" Sen. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican, told CBS News, \"But I'm talking to my colleagues in the Senate to make sure this emergency funding goes through and that it is spent appropriately.\"",

      "Hawkins has shuttered the business until at least January or February. The restaurant suffered nearly $300,000 in damaged equipment, including its refrigeration units and fryers, which is a uniquely painful loss for a restaurant that's partly famous for its onion rings.",
      "\"Small businesses have such little margin for error,\" Hawkins told CBS News.",
      "In the meantime, the backlog of applications for emergency loans has skyrocketed in recent weeks, according to a CBS News review.\u00a0 A federal official said 12,000 disaster loans have been prepared for approval and funding, totaling approximately $1 billion in help. The Small Business Administration is also processing an additional 60,000 applications nationwide, as the impasse over funding in Congress continues.",

    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

    "summary": "The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach, officials said Friday.",
      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",
      "\"I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed,\" she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\"He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They're social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\" she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 47 pounds when he was found to 54 pounds. He is 39 inches tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is farther south than Western Australia.",
      "The government said that with the Southern Hemisphere summer approaching, it had been time-crucial to return Gus to the ocean where he could thermoregulate.",
      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,000 miles on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said.",
      "They are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea\u00a0ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",
      "The penguins breed and live on sea ice, but the\u00a0Antarctic Sea ice is disappearing\u00a0as our planet warms up.",
      "\"They show up at the breeding season and the ice isn't there, so they have nowhere to breed,\" Dr. Birgitte McDonald, an ecologist at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, which is funded and administered by San Jose State University,\u00a0told CBS San Francisco\u00a0last year.",
      "An analysis by scientists at Cambridge University, published last year\u00a0in the journal Science News, found that \"ice in one area was melting especially early in the year,\" putting emperor chicks at extreme risk.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has returned incredible new photos of the Sombrero galaxy, offering a new look at the region.",
      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",
      "Photos taken by the Webb telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, reveals a new texture in the galaxy's outer ring and details the dust along the ring. Such dust is an \"essential building block\" for solar objects, NASA said.",
      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October. Many are requesting to observe distant galaxies like the Sombrero galaxy, NASA said.",

Accelerated to nearly three times the speed of sound, the crew capsule was released to fly on its own about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",

      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",

      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly.

The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",

      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

In North Salem, New York, a seventh-grade media literacy class has been preparing for that challenge by learning how to have difficult but empathetic conversations.",
      "\"One of the most important things to know about media literacy education is that it is not partisan,\" Cynthia Sandler, who's teaching the class, told CBS News. \"It is about asking questions. It is about critical thinking. It is about teaching students and people how to think and not what to think.\"",
      "There is a growing desire for media literacy classes like Sandler's around the country. In the last 15 years, 19 states have added some kind of media literacy standards to their education requirements, according to a\u00a02023 report from Media Literacy Now. The report found at least seven more states have pending legislation on the topic, including New York, home to the largest public school district in the country.",

      "\"Satire can be a form of saying a joke,\" the student explained. \"But satire can be dangerous, because some people may fall for it. Like you might have gone to buy plane tickets for Florida.\"",

      "\"We are working with a citizenry who does not know what to believe,\" Sandler said.",
      "\"Misinformation gets confused with information. And ultimately, you can get to the point where nobody knows what to trust, and nobody trusts anything, and that's a terrible place. That's a terrible place to be in a democracy, that's a terrible place to be as a person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former TV host Charlie Rose has resolved a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by three women in the wake of his #MeToo-era ouster from CBS News in 2017 and the cancellation of his long-running, eponymous PBS talk show.",
      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \"ill intent\" to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \"predatory behavior\" and \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment\" \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others' points of view.\"",
      "\"On reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\" the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\"",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\"It is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\"",
      "Rose's downfall was part of America's #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \"Today\" host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others. In September 2018, Rose said the three women he settled with this week were \"exploiting the #MeToo movement\" when he filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \"CBS This Morning,\" and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \"Charlie Rose Show,\" which had been on the air since 1991.",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \"sexually inappropriate\" while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \"very subtle\" and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \"always professional and respectful.\"",

      "Nick Rowley, another attorney who was part of the plaintiff's team, said the out-of-state medical corporation set up a \"fraudulent scheme to make millions off of conning old men.\" He provided some details in a social media post, saying clinic workers told patients they would have irreversible damage if they didn't agree to injections three times a week.",

      "In a statement shared with CBS News on Wednesday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said that she will soon seek an execution warrant for Aaron Brian Gunches, who is on death row after being convicted of killing his girlfriend's ex-husband.",
      "\"My office has been preparing since earlier this year to resume executions in Arizona,\" Mayes said. \"Back in May, I indicated that executions would resume by early 2025. In accordance with that timeline, I plan to move forward and request an execution warrant from the Arizona Supreme Court in the coming weeks for Aaron Brian Gunches, who was sentenced to death for the murder of Ted Price.\"",
      "Mayes said her office had been working with state corrections officials to review and improve death penalty procedures. \"I am confident that executions can now proceed in compliance with state and federal law,\" Mayes said in her statement.",
      "Gov. Katie Hobbs had promised not to carry out any executions until there was confidence the state can do so without violating any laws. The attorney general's office had said it would not seek a court order to carry out the death penalty while a review was underway.",

      "Gunches had been set to be put to death in April 2023. But Hobbs' office said the state wasn't prepared to enforce the death penalty because it lacked staff with expertise to carry out executions,. At the time, it also said it could not find an IV team to carry out the lethal injection and didn't have a contract with a pharmacist to compound the pentobarbital needed for an execution.",

      "It was determined her level of fault was \"at the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,\" the ITIA said.",
      "This is the second recent high-profile doping case in tennis: The top-ranked man, Jannik Sinner, failed two tests for a steroid in March and was cleared in August, right before the start of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of the season.",
      "Swiatek is a 23-year-old from Poland who was ranked No. 1 most of the past two seasons but is now at No. 2. She won the French Open in June for her fifth major championship and took home a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August.",

But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs \u2014 a threat that drew a prompt and terse response from Sheinbaum, who said any U.S. tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures from her government \u2014 stressing: \"There is no subordination here.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said on Thursday she did not discuss tariffs in the call with Trump.",
      "Trump said in his social media posts that Sheinbaum had \"agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum indicated on social media, however, that she'd \"explained\" to Trump that Mexico is already \"taking care of\" migrant caravans, calling it an \"excellent conversation,\" but indicating no major changes in her government's policies.",
      "\"I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. Thanks to this, migrants and caravans are assisted before they reach the border,\" the Mexican leader wrote. \"We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\"",
      "Trump's social media posts about the borders \u2014 describing what he called \"a wonderful conversation with Sheinbaum and suggesting Mexico had made concessions in the wake of his tariff threat \u2014 did move financial markets.",
      "Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump may argue to his supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool, and continue to rely on tariff threats.",
      "But the only new policy clearly referenced by either leader in their social media posts Wednesday was a vow by Trump to launch a new national ad campaign warning against the dangers of fentanyl use.",

      "In his third, rapid-fire post on his own Truth Social platform about their conversation, the president-elect said he would be \"working on a large scale United States Advertising Campaign, explaining how bad Fentanyl is for people to use \u2014 Millions of lives being so needlessly destroyed. By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is.\"",
      "Illegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.",
      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high last December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified any firm plans to impose new tariffs in their social media messages on Wednesdday. But their implementation could fuel higher prices for American consumers and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20.

    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",

      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities from dozens of countries seized over 225 metric tons of cocaine in a six-week mega-operation where they unearthed a new Pacific trafficking route from South America to Australia, the Colombian Navy said Wednesday. Officials said they had also seized \"increasingly sophisticated\" drug-laden semisubmersibles -- better known as \"narco subs\" -- that can travel 10,000 miles without refueling.",
      "The latest phase of global naval operation \"Orion\" resulted in the seizure of more than 1,400 tons of drugs, including over 225 tons of cocaine and 128 tons of marijuana, Navy official Orlando Enrique Grisales told reporters.",
      "More than 400 people were arrested in the operation targeting oceans, coasts, rivers and ports around the globe in October and November.",
      "\"This is perhaps the largest seizure of cocaine in transit made by Colombia in history,\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on social media.",
      "The massive bust involved the security agencies of the United States, Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands and several other nations, as well as multiple international organizations.",
      "The seizure deprived drug cartels of more than $8.4 billion dollars, according to a Navy statement.",
      "Grisales said officials also seized a semisubmersible wood-and-fiber glass vessel on its way to Australia with five tons of Colombian cocaine.",
      "This was the third such vessel discovered in this area, revealing a \"new route\" of trafficking with sophisticated boats that can cover the distance of some 10,000 miles without needing to refuel.",
      "A kilogram of cocaine is sold for up to $240,000 in Australia, said Grisales -- about six times more than the price in the United States.",
      "\"It is a route that is becoming increasingly profitable because prices are much higher in Australia,\" a security source told AFP.",
      "\"Initially, these boats were used mainly to take the drugs out of the country and move them off the coast of Colombia and then transfer them to ships,\" added the source.",
      "\"It has been found that these semisubmersibles, sometimes even submersibles, are now increasingly sophisticated, with very fine engineering.\"",
      "Semisubmersibles, which cannot go fully underwater, are popular among international drug traffickers as they can sometimes elude detection by law enforcement. The vessels are sometimes\u00a0seized\u00a0in Colombian waters while heading to the United States, Central America and Europe. In June, the Colombian Navy\u00a0said\u00a0it seized two \"narco subs\" off the country's Pacific coast that together contained almost 5 tons of cocaine.",
      "In February, Colombian authorities on a search-and-rescue mission for two missing fishermen\u00a0found\u00a0a \"narco sub\" loaded with more than 4 tons of cocaine. A few weeks before that, the Colombian navy\u00a0intercepted a semisubmersible\u00a0loaded with more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The latest \"Orion\" operation also uncovered previously-unknown alliances between cartels from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru with groups from Europe and Oceania.",
      "\"It is not just a pyramid structure as the cartels once were. Today they are organized crime networks joined together,\" said Grisales.",

    "summary": "As Israel and Hezbollah cease fire after a year, President Biden says Palestinians in war-torn Gaza also \"deserve an end of the fighting and displacement.\"",
    "story": [
      "As a ceasefire the U.S. helped broker between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah came into effect Wednesday, President Biden said his administration would quickly launch \"another push\" with international partners to secure a deal to end the even deadlier war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Mr. Biden, who has less than two months left in office, said in a social media post Wednesday morning that his administration would work in the coming days with Israel and other partners in the region to \"achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the [Israeli] hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power.\"",
      "The ceasefire the U.S. and France helped secure to stop the fighting between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel appeared to be largely holding Wednesday hours after it took effect. There was, however, an unverified claim from the head of Lebanon's national journalists syndicate that Israeli forces in or near the southern city of Khiam had opened fire \"at a group of journalists and correspondents\" there, allegedly leaving two \u2014 one with The Associated Press and one with the Russian agency Sputnik \u2014 with unspecified injuries.",
      "Lebanon's state-run National News Agency cited the head of the syndicate, Joseph Al-Qasifi, as calling it \"the first violation of the ceasefire.\"",
      "A spokesperson for The Associated Press told CBS News the agency was \"grateful our freelancer is OK,\" suggesting any injuries sustained were minor, but adding: \"Journalists must be able to safely operate in Lebanon as they cover this conflict.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment on the incident, but the IDF said in a brief statement that troops had questioned four \"suspects [who] approached IDF soldiers stationed in southern Lebanon\" Wednesday. There were no further details, and it was unclear whether that incident was related to the alleged shooting in Khiam.",
      "The war in Lebanon simmered for months after Hezbollah started launching rockets at northern Israel in support of its ideological allies Hamas, the day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel, sparking the war in Gaza. That attack saw Hamas and allied militants kill some 1,200 people in Israel and take 250 others hostage.",
      "The near-constant volley of rockets and missiles across the Israel-Lebanon border escalated dramatically in September, and Lebanese officials said about 3,800 people had been killed by the time the truce took effect Wednesday morning. Israeli authorities say Hezbollah's rocket strikes have killed 45 civilians over the past year, and at least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed amid the operations in southern Lebanon.",
      "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, told reporters Wednesday that it is Israel that \"is going to choose\" how it finishes the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "\"Never forget that Hezbollah started this attack on Israel. Israel didn't attack them, they attacked Israel, on October the 8th, the day after the massacre outside of Gaza,\" Huckabee said. \"The old reality is that if you start a war with me, you may get to start it, but I choose how we finish it. Israel is going to choose how they finish it. Not Iran, not the U.N., not France, not America. Israel will decide how this has to end.\"",
      "But the agreement between Israel and Hezbollah did not address the war in Gaza, which sits at the heart of the tension in the Middle East. Health officials in the decimated, Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory say Israel's military assault in Gaza has killed more than 44,280 people and left some 104,000 others wounded. Most of the enclave's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, many of them forced to flee multiple times over the last year.",
      "\"Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza. They too deserve an end of the fighting and displacement,\" Mr. Biden said Tuesday at the White House. \"The people of Gaza have been through hell.\"",
      "Hamas indicated its openness to renewed negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire on Wednesday, with a senior official from the group telling the French news agency AFP that it had \"informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that Hamas is ready for a ceasefire agreement and a serious deal to exchange prisoners.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri as saying the group recognized Lebanon's right to take part in the ceasefire with Israel, to protect its population, and voicing hope that an agreement to end the Gaza war might also be possible after many months of largely fruitless talks.",
      "Mr. Biden said the U.S. would work with \"Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others\" to broker a so-far elusive deal between Israel and Hamas, and the Egyptian government announced Wednesday that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had already met with the visiting Qatari prime minister to review \"joint efforts aimed at a ceasefire in Gaza, joint efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the unconditional access of humanitarian and relief aid to the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan also visited Cairo and met with el-Sisi, discussing both the ceasefire in Lebanon and the latest developments in Gaza, according to Egyptian officials.",
      "But while the negotiators renew their efforts on Gaza, they'll likely be keeping a very close, even wary eye on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, as there's far more international will behind the ceasefire with Hezbollah than there is trust between the longtime foes.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah were exchanging heavy fire right up until the moments before the ceasefire came into effect Wednesday. It will now be a tense wait to see if the peace holds during the 60-day period when Israeli forces, who crossed the border in early October, slowly pull out of Hezbollah's previous stronghold in southern Lebanon. They are to be replaced by Lebanese soldiers and United Nations peacekeepers during a process monitored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Over the coming two months, Israel must withdraw all its troops from Lebanon and Hezbollah must pull its fighters and weapons back about 20 miles north of the border, to the other side of the Litani River.",
      "But the distrust on both sides of the border \u2013 the so-called Blue Line established after the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006 \u2013 runs deep. Both Mr. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed Tuesday that, in the Israeli leader's words: \"If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack.\"",
      "\"For every violation,\" Netanyahu threatened, \"we will attack with might.\"",
      "Speaking Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings\" U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration helped broker the truce based on previous successes, and failures.",
      "\"We have learned from the past,\" he said, \"and we have designed this deal to be long-standing and to stay in effect - to continue to sustain the peace and also to ensure the security of the State of Israel.\"",
      "The fighting between Israel and Hezbollah drove hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians from their homes in the south, and about 60,000 Israelis from their communities near the border in the north.",
      "\"It's not safe to go home,\" Israeli Eliyahu Maman said as the truce silenced the rocket-fire, \"because Hezbollah can still harm us.\"",
      "On the other side of the border, Beirut resident Rima Abdkhaluk said she didn't \"believe in this ceasefire\u2026 Israel cannot be trusted.\"",
      "But neither the lack of trust nor warnings from Israeli and Lebanese officials for civilians not to return to areas evacuated amid Israel's offensive since October were enough to deter thousands of Lebanese civilians from packing their belongings back into cars and cramming onto highways to try to return to their homes in the south on Wednesday.",
      "Some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza will be hoping that they, too, might get the chance to start rebuilding their shattered lives in the coming weeks. The families of about 100 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip will be hoping the renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas can also bring their loved ones back home.",

    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

      "The FBI said it coordinated with U.K. authorities to arrest San Diego, who has been wanted in connection with two animal rights-related bombings in Northern California in 2003. He was put on the Most Wanted Terrorists list in 2009.",
      "\"Daniel San Diego's arrest after more than 20 years as a fugitive for two bombings in the San Francisco area shows that no matter how long it takes, the FBI will find you and hold you accountable,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement announcing the arrest. \"There's a right way and a wrong way to express your views in our country, and turning to violence and destruction of property is not the right way.\"",
      "The U.K. National Crime Agency said that San Diego was arrested in Conwy, a town near Wales' northern coast. He was arrested by officers from the agency's Joint International Crime Center at a property in a rural area next to a woodland, an agency spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "San Diego allegedly planted two bombs at the offices of Chiron Inc. in Emeryville, California, in August 2003. The first bomb detonated early in the morning. The second, which was set to detonate an hour after the initial blast and may have been meant to kill or injure first responders according to the FBI, was found and cleared before it could go off.",
      "A month later, San Diego allegedly planted another bomb at a company in Pleasanton, California. That bomb was wrapped in nails, the FBI said, but no one was injured when it went off.",
      "A federal arrest warrant was issued for San Diego in October 2003, but he disappeared before he could be taken into custody. A federal grand jury indicted San Diego with two counts of destroying or attempting to destroy property with explosives and two counts of use of a destructive device in a crime of violence in 2004.",
      "San Diego was considered armed and dangerous during the two decades he went uncaptured. He had ties to animal rights extremist groups, the FBI said.",
      "San Diego made his first court appearance on Tuesday as extradition proceedings began to return him to the United States, the National Crime Agency said. He was ordered to remain in custody.",

    "summary": "A ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah appeared to be holding several hours after it began.",
    "story": [
      "A ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon appeared to be holding after it came into effect at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday (10 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday). President Biden announced the ceasefire deal Tuesday, saying the U.S. and France had helped broker the agreement.",
      "Celebratory gunshots were heard in Beirut, where people took to the streets to cheer the cessation of hostilities \u2014 however long it lasts.",
      "Lebanon's army said it was preparing to send troops to the country's south, where they will help ensure the truce deal is adhered to, and they asked residents of the border region not to return until Israeli forces pull out, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Israeli military warned Lebanese residents to stay away from previously evacuated areas across the south, east and around the capital Beirut, but several highways were crowded with vehicles carrying people back to their homes, many of which were in ruins after months of devastating Israeli airstrikes.",
      "The ceasefire doesn't cover the ongoing fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, another militant group backed by Iran. But Hamas said Wednesday that it, too, was ready to negotiate a truce.",
      "\"We have informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that Hamas is ready for a ceasefire agreement and a serious deal to exchange prisoners,\" a senior Hamas official told the French news agency AFP, again accusing Israel of blocking a truce deal.",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri as saying the group understood Lebanon's right to reach a unilateral agreement with Israel to protect its people, and that he hoped a deal to end the war in Gaza could also be reached.",
      "Mr. Biden's announcement came Tuesday as the Israel security cabinet approved the ceasefire, after urging from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "The war between Israel and the so called Iranian proxy group Hezbollah\u00a0has killed almost 3,800 people in Lebanon over the last year and left about 16,000 others wounded, according to the country's health ministry.",
      "\"I have some good news to report from the Middle East,\" Mr. Biden said on the White House South Lawn. \"I just spoke with the Prime Minister[s] of Israel and Lebanon. I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States' proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. I want to thank President Macron of France for his partnership in reaching this moment.\"",
      "\"This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,\" he added. \"What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed \u2014 I emphasize, will not be allowed \u2014 to threaten the security of Israel ever again.\"",
      "Under the agreement, over the next 60 days, the Lebanese Army and state security forces will take control once again, Mr. Biden said, and Israel will gradually withdraw its remaining forces. Since the war with Hezbollah began, more than 70,000 Israelis have been \"forced to live as refugees in their own country,\" he said, while over 300,000 Lebanese people have been forced from their homes.",
      "\"Let's be clear,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either, nor did the United States.\"",
      "Echoing earlier remarks by Netanyahu, Mr. Biden said that if Hezbollah or anyone else violates the ceasefire and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense.",
      "In a joint statement released later, Mr. Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said \"the announcement today will cease the fighting in Lebanon, and secure Israel from the threat of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon,\" adding that it would \"create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line [Lebanon-Israel border].\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel's war cabinet had approved the ceasefire and he had urged ministers in the full cabinet to approve the deal Tuesday night. He did not give specifics, but said if Hezbollah breaks the terms, Israel would \"respond severely.\"",
      "The ceasefire has halted the deadliest war to take place in Lebanon since its civil war, which ended in 1990.",
      "Under the agreement, there will be 60 days permitted for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces \u2014 a gradual withdrawal to allow the Lebanese forces to mobilize and move in to secure the area. A U.S. official told CBS News earlier Tuesday that the first peel-off of Israeli troops would begin within 10 days.",
      "Hezbollah is expected to pull its forces and heavy weapons back about 20 miles from the Israeli border, to the Litani River, a senior Biden administration official told reporters in a call Tuesday, while the Lebanese Armed Forces will move south of that line and take up positions. Hezbollah, as part of the agreement, will not be permitted to rebuild infrastructure or weaponry again in the area they vacate, the official said.",
      "\"As the Lebanese military deploys and reaches the south, the Israeli military will withdraw,\" the official explained.",
      "U.S. troops will not deploy in the area, but the U.S. and France will provide additional support \u2014 including equipment, training and financial resources \u2014 to the Lebanese army, the official added. That will be done through the Military Technical Committee, a previously formed international coalition that was revived by the U.S. a few months ago.",
      "The U.S. and France will also join an existing mechanism referred to as the Tripartite Mechanism which was created shortly after the last war between Israel and Lebanon in 2006, the official said. The U.S. will chair it, and through diplomats and military personnel, receive and attempt to address complaints by either side of potential violations.",
      "The Biden administration official said the incoming Trump team was not involved in the ceasefire negotiations, however, following the election \u2014 and once it appeared that a deal may be close \u2014 the current administration briefed President-elect Donald Trump's national security team for the first time on the tenets of the deal, saying the Trump team seemed supportive.",
      "According to a U.S. official, Iran was also briefed, given Tehran's longtime support of Hezbollah. Long a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon, Hezbollah has been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel for years.",
      "Hezbollah started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the\u00a0war in Gaza\u00a0with their terror attack the previous day.",
      "Israel carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it\u00a0dramatically escalated its assault\u00a0on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.",
      "CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said\u00a0rockets were still flying in both directions\u00a0over Israel's northern border on Tuesday before the deal was announced, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date.",
      "Despite the deal to end the fighting in Lebanon that was sparked by the parallel war in Gaza, negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have thus far gone nowhere.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier Tuesday that deescalating tension in the region with a Lebanon truce \"can also help us to end the conflict in Gaza.\"",
      "\"In particular, Hamas will know it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war,\" he said.",
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement late Tuesday that \"as we welcome the news of this ceasefire, we also hope that deescalating tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border also brings renewed hope for ending the tragic conflict in Gaza. We must continue to focus on improving the desperate humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and we remain committed to securing the release of all of the hostages in Gaza, including U.S. citizens.\"",
      "Many in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse. A winter chill has set in, and there were reports of a fresh Israeli strike killing about 15 people Tuesday in Gaza City.",

    "summary": "The cartel allegedly uses fishing boats to smuggle drugs and migrants \u2014 and catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species.",
    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a\u00a0timeshare fraud\u00a0ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",
      "The month before that, U.S. officials announced economic sanctions against eight targets affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, accused of fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling. Among the leaders targeted was an alleged assassin named Uriel Tabares Martinez.\u00a0 According to the Treasury Department, he is known as \"El Medico\" (\"The Doctor\") for the violent and surgical manner in which he\u00a0tortures\u00a0and kills those who cross the high-ranking members of the cartel.",

    "story": [
      "Sydney, Australia \u2014\u00a0A police officer who shocked a 95-year-old nursing home resident with a Taser was found guilty of manslaughter in an Australian court Wednesday. A jury found Kristian James Samuel White guilty in the trial in Sydney after 20 hours of deliberation. White, who is on bail, could get up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced later.",
      "Clare Nowland, a great-grandmother who had dementia and used a walker, was refusing to put down the steak knife she was holding when the officer discharged his Taser at her in May 2023. Nowland fell backward after White shocked her and died a week later in hospital.",
      "Police said at the time that Nowland sustained her fatal injuries from striking her head on the floor, rather than directly from the device's debilitating electric shock.",
      "White's employment is under review and is subject to legal processes, New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters after the verdict.",
      "\"The court has found Claire Nowland died as a result of the actions of a police officer. This should never have happened,\" Webb said, as she offered her \"deepest condolences\" to Nowland's family. The state's police reviewed its Taser policy and training in January and no changes to it were made, she added.",
      "In video played during the New South Wales Supreme Court trial, White was heard saying \"nah, bugger it\" before discharging his weapon, after the officers told Nowland 21 times to put the knife down. White, 34, told the jury he had been taught that any person wielding a knife was dangerous, the Guardian reported.",
      "But after an eight-day trial, the jury rejected arguments by White's lawyers that his use of the Taser was a proportionate response to the threat posed by Nowland, who weighed about 100 pounds.",
      "White and other officers were called to the nursing home by staff who told them a woman was \"armed with a knife.\"",
      "Police said they urged Nowland to drop the serrated steak knife before she started moving toward them \"at a slow pace,\" with her walking frame, prompting White to fire his taser at her.",
      "The prosecutor argued that White's use of the Taser was \"utterly unnecessary and obviously excessive,\" local news outlets said.",
      "The extraordinary case provoked debate about how officers in the state use Tasers, a device that incapacitates people using electricity.",
      "Nowland, a resident of Yallambee Lodge, a nursing home in the town of Cooma, was survived by eight children, 24 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.",
      "Lawyers for Nowland's family filed a separate civil suit last year against the New South Wales state government, seeking damages on behalf of her estate for alleged battery and assault. The suit was settled on private terms in March this year.",
      "Cooma businessman and community advocate Andrew Thaler, speaking on Australian television not long after the incident, said Nowland was, \"about 5-foot-2 and weighs all of 43 kilos [about 95 pounds], she can't walk on her own without walking assistance.\"",
      "\"The use of a Taser, when a kind word was all she needed, if she was confused \u2014 which is what happens with people who have dementia \u2014 she needed kind words and assistance and help,\" Thaler said. \"She didn't need the force of the law.\"",

      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

      "\"We can confirm there were sightings yesterday (Monday) during nighttime hours and can only confirm that the number fluctuated, and varied between the bases over the night,\" a USAF in Europe spokesperson said in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse by the 100th Air Refueling Wing, which is based at the Royal Air Force base in Mildenhall, eastern England.",
      "Mildenhall is one of three bases where drones have been spotted intermittently since November 20. The other two are the nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Feltwell.",

      "\"I can confirm the situation is still ongoing and our units continue to monitor the airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities, and assets,\" a U.S. Air Forces in Europe spokesperson told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "A spokesman for the UK's Ministry of Defense said that it took \"threats seriously\" and was supporting the USAF response. CBS News' partner network BBC News said the U.K. military had deployed about 60 additional British troops to the bases to help aid in U.S. efforts to determine who is responsible for the drones.",
      "The personnel have been sent to assist the US Air Force (USAF) in its investigation, the BBC understands.",
      "While no entity or third nation has been named as a possible source of the unexplained drones, several major U.S. adversaries, including Russia and Iran, have been accused of increasing their espionage and sabotage activities in Europe this year.",

      "Tension between Russia and the U.S. and Britain has also been extremely high amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, with British fighter jets scrambled only a week and a half ago to monitor a Russian reconnaissance aircraft that was flying close to U.K. airspace. That came just days after\u00a0NATO jets were mobilized\u00a0when Russian aircraft were spotted over the Baltic Sea and off the coast of Norway.",

      "When taking GLP-1 medications, gastric emptying is already slowed, Osborn noted, which means too much fat ingested in one sitting will cause nausea and potential vomiting.",

      "\"You can enjoy traditional Thanksgiving dishes, but in much smaller quantities,\" Osborn said. \"Focus on a few bites of high-calorie dishes rather than full servings.\"",

    "summary": "If confirmed, those who worked with Bondi expect her to use her role as attorney general to crack down on drugs and trafficking\u2014a playbook first espoused as Florida&apos;s top prosecutor.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Trump transition team on 'Special Report.'",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last week announced the nomination of Florida\u2019s former attorney general, Pam Bondi, to head up the Justice Department, touching off a flurry of speculation as to how Bondi, a longtime prosecutor and close ally of Trump, might lead the department.",
      "Former colleagues who knew her best during her time as a Florida prosecutor, including a Democrat opponent for state attorney general who she later tapped to be her drug czar, described Bondi in a series of interviews as an experienced litigator whose leadership style is more consensus-builder than bridge-burner and whose tenure may generate less friction among rank-and-file career staff at the Justice Department than early critics might fear.",
      "If confirmed, those close to Bondi told Fox News Digital that she will likely espouse many of the same priorities she did in her years as a prosecutor in Florida, primarily in cracking down on drug trafficking, illicit fentanyl imports and in running a Justice Department that enforces fair treatment of both political and career appointees alike.",
      "\"From a lawyer's standpoint, this woman knows how to be a lawyer and a trial lawyer,\" Nicholas Cox, Florida's statewide prosecutor, told Fox News Digital of Bondi's record. \"There's just not a question about it.\"",
      "Here are some of the ways her time in Florida could inform her tenure as attorney general.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and nominee for AG Pam Bondi (AP | Getty)",
      "Drug crackdown:",
      "In Florida, Bondi quickly earned a reputation for cracking down on opioids and the many \"pill mills\" operating in the Sunshine State when she was elected as the state's attorney general in 2010. At the time, Florida \"was the epicenter of the opioid crisis,\" Florida statewide prosecutor Nicholas Cox said in an interview.",
      "It was also a hub for so-called drug tourism: Out-of-state residents traveled to Florida from across the country to purchase opioids in bulk, relying on the state's many-house pharmacies, \"cash-only\" clinics and a lack of statewide prescribing laws to purchase the addictive medications, largely without restriction.",
      "When Bondi took office, opioids were killing around seven people each day, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, who formerly served as Bondi's drug czar, said in an interview.",
      "There were also \"more pain clinics than McDonald's locations\" in Florida at the time, he said, illustrating the magnitude of the problem.",
      "Aronberg, a Democrat who ran against Bondi for attorney general in 2010 before she appointed him to the post, credits his former boss as being the person \"most responsible for ridding the state of Florida of destructive pill mills.\"",
      "He and others point to Bondi's push for legislation that helped eliminate pill mills in the state, her crackdown on doctors and clinics responsible for prescribing the pain pills en masse, and her work in enforcing Florida's \"Statewide Prescription Drug Diversion and Abuse Road Map\" to best coordinate federal, state and local efforts as helping end the crisis.",
      "Later, she served in Trump's first presidential term as a member of his Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission.",
      "If confirmed as U.S. attorney general, Bondi has made clear she plans to remain focused on cracking down on illicit drugs\u2014albeit on a national scale.",
      "Bondi's former colleagues told Fox News Digital they expect she will bring the same playbook to Washington\u2014this time with an eye to cracking down on drug trafficking, illicit fentanyl use, and the cartels responsible for smuggling the drugs across the border.",

      "Working across the aisle:",
      "Bondi has spent years as a prosecutor in Florida, first as a prosecutor in the Hillsborough County State Attorney\u2019s Office before being elected in 2010 as the state's attorney general.",
      "Cox, the Florida state prosecutor, noted that Bondi's career was also heavily shaped by her 18 years working in the Florida District Attorney's Office, a career position that was not informed by politics.",
      "There, the main focus was \"cooperation\"\u2014 a mentality that Cox said extended to \"prosecutors, law enforcement, and public defenders, for that matter.\"\u00a0 \"We all worked together and it made for a really strong criminal justice system,\" Cox said.",
      "\"We all worked together, and it made for a really strong criminal justice system,\" Cox said.",
      "Aronberg echoed this assessment. The state attorney for Palm Beach county had formerly served as a Democrat in the state senate before running for attorney general. He later dropped out endorsed her Democratic opponent.",
      "But afrer her election, Bondi tapped him to be her drug czar\u2014 an unorthodox move that Aronberg and others said demonstrates Bondi's commitment to solving problems and working across the aisle on top priorities.",
      "\"It really said a lot about her because she got a lot of criticism, withering criticism, from some members of her own party\" who were upset she would choose a Democrat for the role, Aronberg said.",
      "DNC UNION LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP FORMER STAFFERS HIT BY MASSIVE LAYOFFS AFTER ELECTION LOSSES",
      "In Florida, Bondi \"was not seen as a very partisan person,\" he added, citing her \"strong working relationship with Democrats,\" which continued even after being sworn in as state attorney general.",
      "\"She would support legislation regardless of whether it was supported by Democrats or Republicans,\" Aronberg said, and in return, she was well-liked across the aisle.",
      "Pam Bondi (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images)",
      "Trump \u2018enemies\u2019",
      "In announcing Bondi as his nomination for attorney general, Trump again took aim at the Justice Department, which he characterized as being \"weaponized\" against him.",
      "\"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again,\" Trump said in the statement.",
      "But those close to Bondi said they do not think of her as an overly political person, saying they believe the many years she spent as a litigator and state attorney general will help her deftly navigate the unique political pressures in the role, including Trump's calls to go after his so-called \"enemies\" within the Department of Justice.",
      "Though Bondi herself has echoed calls to \"investigate the investigators\" involved in the special counsel investigations into Donald Trump, former colleagues said they think she has learned from former Justice Department leaders before her, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former Special Counsel John Durham, who was tapped by Barr to investigate alleged misconduct in the Trump-Russia probe.",
      "\"I\u2019ve told my Democratic friends not to overreact because we have been through this before,\" Aronberg said, citing the special counsel probe led by Durham.",

Customers using Gmail, Yahoo, and other common email providers can be confident that when they receive an @amazon.com email with the smile logo in their inbox, that email is really from us.\"",
      "Can you explain Amazon's A-to-z Guarantee and how it protects holiday shoppers?",
      "\"When customers shop in the Amazon store, they can do so with peace of mind knowing that we stand behind the products sold in our store with the\u00a0A-to-Z Guarantee.",
      "\"When a claim is filed, Amazon combines our advanced fraud and abuse detection systems with external, independent insurance specialists to analyze filings, take on the investigative work for our selling partners, present valid claims, and deny unsubstantiated, frivolous, or abusive claims. By doing this work on behalf of sellers, we save them from having to investigate these claims on their own. Innovating this process enables customers to shop confidently, which in turn drives selling partner success.",
      "\"Amazon\u2019s protection applies to physical products purchased in our store worldwide, and in the unlikely event that customers experience issues with timely delivery or the condition of their purchase, whether purchased from Amazon or one of our approximately two million selling partners, Amazon will make it right by refunding or replacing it.\u00a0Whether during the holiday shopping season, or anytime throughout the year, customers can confidently shop Amazon\u2019s vast selection of amazing products with the A-to-z Guarantee.\"",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "How can Amazon customers stay safe?",
      "1. Watch out for red flags:\u00a0Some telltale signs of an impersonation scam include requests for account or payment information and creating a false sense of urgency. Amazon will never ask for your password, payment or bank transfer through phone, email or any external website. Scammers might reference a purchase (real or fake), a giveaway, a prize or claim that \"your account is locked,\" urging you to click a link, make a payment or buy a gift card.",
      "2. Verify the email: For any questions related to an order, always check your order history on Amazon.com or via the \"Amazon Shopping\" app. Only legitimate purchases will appear in your order history. If you are ever unsure about the legitimacy of an email, go to Amazon\u2019s website or app to access the Message Center and review authentic communications.",
      "In addition, you should always check the sender\u2019s email address by hovering over the \"From\" name and verify it\u2019s a genuine Amazon email, which will come from \"@amazon.com.\"",

      "3. Beware of phishing links: Avoid clicking on random links, especially in messages about shopping deals, order confirmations or account issues. Scammers often use fake links to mimic legitimate retailers and steal your information.",

      "4. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" offers: Scammers often lure victims with irresistible deals, such as huge discounts on popular products or \"exclusive\" offers. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. These offers might be tied to fake websites or phishing attempts designed to steal your personal and financial details. Always double-check the legitimacy of any deal before making a purchase. If you\u2019re unsure, visit the official Amazon site or app to search for the product and compare prices.",
      "5. Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity: If you encounter an impersonation scam, your best course of action is to report it to Amazon. Knapp says,\u00a0\"The more consumers report scams to us, the better our tools get at identifying bad actors so that we can take action against them and protect consumers. If consumers suspect that they have encountered a scam, they can report suspicious communications to us at amazon.com/ReportAScam, so that we can protect their accounts and refer bad actors to law enforcement to help keep consumers safe.\"",

      "Scammers will do their best to ruin your holiday season, but most of their tactics can be easily avoided with the right tools and a little common sense. Be cautious of unsolicited texts, emails or phone calls offering deals, discounts or asking for your personal information. If you're shopping on Amazon, track everything through the Amazon app and reach out to their customer support for any concerns or questions.",

      "1. Display rack gift card trick",
      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number.

      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",

      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue.

      "They will tell you that you have won a prize, sweepstakes or a promotion and that you need to pay a fee, a tax or a shipping cost to claim it. They will then ask you to pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",

      "6. Fake balance checker scam",
      "In this scam, fraudsters set up fake websites or phone services that claim to check the balance of your gift cards. Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance.

      "Kurt Knutsson explains how to safeguard retirement accounts from cyber threats with a VPN: encryption, anonymity, secure access.",
      "Protecting your financial future goes beyond smart investing and saving. It's crucial to safeguard your retirement accounts from cyber threats. While many believe that using\u00a0public Wi-Fi to check their 401(k) or IRA is harmless, the reality is that without proper protection, you could be putting your hard-earned savings at risk. Let's explore why using a VPN (virtual private network) is essential for securing your retirement accounts and how you can implement this extra layer of security.",

      "A woman using a VPN on her tablet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "2) Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5) Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6) Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up to date with the latest security patches.",
      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

By implementing a VPN and following best security practices, you're taking proactive steps to ensure that the nest egg you've worked so hard to build remains safe and secure. Remember, the small investment in a quality VPN service is negligible compared to the potential losses from a compromised retirement account.",

Experts have identified similarities between this malware and previous attacks linked to North Korea, including the use of certain coding methods and domains that the country\u2019s cyber teams are known to exploit.",
      "North Korea has a history of using cyberattacks to fund its operations or disrupt systems worldwide, often targeting financial systems or vulnerable individuals. In this case, the malware seems to be in the testing phase, potentially laying the groundwork for a larger attack in the future.",
      "The apps containing the malware were designed to look harmless. These tactics suggest a focus on tricking people through social engineering, a method North Korean hackers have used in the past.",
      "By embedding the malware within apps that appear useful or fun, the attackers can increase the chances of someone downloading and using the infected software. While this particular malware has not yet been linked to active attacks, its connection to North Korea\u2019s cyber playbook is a strong indicator of potential risks ahead.",

      "1) Use reliable antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus program is your first line of defense against malicious links and malware that could steal your private information. Avoid clicking on random links, especially in emails or messages that claim to be urgent or demand updates. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. It can also warn you about phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping to keep your personal data and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful with downloads and links:\u00a0Only download apps from trusted sources like the Mac App Store or official websites of known developers. Hackers often disguise malware as legitimate updates or harmless apps.",
      "3) Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular updates for macOS and installed apps are essential because they patch security flaws. Apple frequently rolls out updates to address vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates ensures you stay protected without the hassle of manually checking for them.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0A strong password can help keep your Mac safe from unauthorized access. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here\u2014it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Activate\u00a02FA for key accounts like your Apple ID, email, and financial services. This adds a second layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your accounts\u2014even if they have your password.",

      "I've noticed a significant rise in malware hiding in seemingly harmless apps, whether it's related to Mac, Windows, Android, or even iPhones. It just shows that no device is completely safe, not even one made by Apple. Hackers, including those backed by North Korea, are constantly finding new ways to trick users into downloading malicious software. These attacks often fly under the radar because they look like regular, safe apps. With these threats becoming more sophisticated, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay aware of the risks and be cautious about what you download and click on.",

      "A Stanford University \"misinformation expert\" has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft testimony later used by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a politically-charged case.",
      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",
      "\"Perhaps this was simply a copy-paste error? It\u2019s not,\" the filing later flatly states. \"The article doesn\u2019t exist.\"",
      "The attorneys concluded that, if the declaration were partially fabricated, it is entirely unreliable and should be dismissed from court consideration.",
      "\"The declaration of Prof. Hancock should be excluded in its entirety because at least some of it is based on fabricated material likely generated by an AI model, which calls into question its conclusory assertions,\" the document concluded. \"The court may inquire into the source of the fabrication and additional action may be warranted.\"",

      "Benefits of privacy-focused email services",
      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices. They offer an ad-free experience and give you greater control over your personal information. This means that when you choose a secure email service, you are investing in a platform that prioritizes your privacy and security.",

      "Switching to a secure email service involves several steps that can enhance your online security. First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection. Finally, take some time to familiarize yourself with the new interface and features offered by your secure email service.",

      "The value of investing in privacy",
      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue.

      "It\u2019s the perfect time to pick up holiday gifts for your family and treat yourself to that pricey watch you wouldn\u2019t splurge on otherwise.",
      "Black Friday is a worldwide cultural and economic phenomenon today. It comes with much anticipation, great discounts and a shopping frenzy. Its success is such that it now lasts the whole month. But don\u2019t let the excitement cloud your judgment.",

      "The devil\u2019s in the privacy policy",
      "Particularly when it comes to online shopping, we give up personal data with every purchase. Information such as your email address, name and address is necessary to create an account or receive a delivery. And that\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s used for these purposes only.",
      "However, the fine print linked under \"Privacy Policy\" that you agree to at checkout often comes with a long list or, worse still, an unspecified number of third parties with which your data will be shared. Retailers often sell personal information and purchase histories to third parties, such as marketing companies and data brokers, who use it to build detailed consumer profiles. Once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s very hard to remove your information from these third-party databases.",
      "Arguably, this happens all the time, Black Friday or not. But with all the marketing strategies pushing us to buy quickly and buy more, we\u2019re just less likely to pay attention.",

      "The term \"Black Friday\" was originally coined in the 1950s by Philadelphia police officers to describe the chaos that ensued the day after Thanksgiving, when hordes of shoppers and tourists flooded the city.",
      "After the shopping extravaganza of Black Friday, your inbox and phone may experience their own dark moments. A surge in spam is widely reported during the month of November. This unwanted communication can come from several sources.",
      "First, from the online shops where you\u2019ve left your email and phone number. Second, from all the companies that received your consumer profile, the ones listed (or not) in the fine print of the privacy policy. Third, from all the retailers you bought from in the past, including that one-time purchase of a kettlebell set three years ago (that you\u2019d rather forget).",
      "But that\u2019s not all; Black Friday is a fiesta for hackers, too, and the perfect time for social engineering attacks! The urgency and excitement of Black Friday deals encourage you to let your guard down. You\u2019re likelier to click on links or open attachments without checking the source. And less likely to notice that a phishing email pretending to be sent by a big retailer has sneaked into your inbox. Your data is being collected, shared and sold as you read this article.",

Depending on where you live, these options may simply not be available to you.",
      "An easier solution is to use a\u00a0disposable email address whenever you open an account for the sole purpose of making a purchase. Once you receive your order confirmation, you can disable it so that no further communication is sent your way. You can also use privacy-focused tools or browsers that block tracking cookies and prevent companies from collecting your data.",

      "As the dust settles from the shopping rush, it's crucial to be proactive; here are eight essential tips to help you protect your email and personal information from the surge of spam and scams that often follow.",
      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information. These resources can help you maintain your privacy while enjoying the benefits of online shopping. Also, remember that post-Black Friday, you may find yourself inundated with spam and unwanted communications from retailers and third parties.

There was no missing internal organs. The [stomach] of the animal was full. They had been eating. They had been drinking. They had not been any stress to them at all.\"",

      "Uruguay ousted its conservative government that had been in charge for the past five years, as leftist opposition candidate Yamand\u00fa Orsi claimed victory in a tight presidential runoff Sunday.",
      "Even as the vote count continued, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, the presidential candidate of the center-right ruling coalition, conceded defeat to his challenger.",
      "\"With sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,\" he told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo.",
      "Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, was mentored by former President Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became world renowned for driving Uruguay\u2019s legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana a decade ago. Orsi thanked his supporters as crowds flocked to greet him.",

      "\"The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,\" he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.",
      "\"Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,\" he said. \"These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.\"",
      "\"I will be the president who calls for national dialogue again and again, who builds a more integrated society and country,\" Orsi said.",
      "\"Starting tomorrow, I'll have to work very hard, there's a lot to do,\" he told the Associated Press from the glass-walled NH Columbia hotel, thronged friends and colleagues embracing and congratulating him.",
      "With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials reported that Orsi won just over 49% of the vote, ahead of Delgado\u2019s 46%. The rest cast blank votes or abstained in defiance of Uruguay's enforced compulsory voting. Turnout reached almost 90%.",
      "After weeks in which the rivals appeared tied in the polls, Delgado's concession ushers in Orsi as Uruguay\u2019s new leader and cuts short the center-right Republican coalition's shot at governing.",

      "The 2019 election of President Luis Lacalle Pou spelled an end to 15 consecutive years of rule by the Broad Front.",
      "\"I called Yamand\u00fa Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country,\" Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X, adding that he would \"put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate.\"",
      "Orsi's victory made the South American country the latest to rebuke the incumbent party in the wake of post-pandemic economic malaise.",
      "The win contrasts with that of populist Javier Milei, who won the presidency in Argentina in 2023 by promising to overhaul the establishment to deal with soaring inflation and poverty. Milei reportedly has grown close to President-elect Trump.",
      "Orsi has been described as a moderate with no radical plans for change. He largely agrees with his opponent on key voter concerns like driving down the childhood poverty rate, now at a staggering 25%, and containing an upsurge in organized crime that has shaken the nation long considered among Latin America's safest.",
      "ARGENTINA'S MILEI BLASTS UN OVER SUPPORT FOR COVID LOCKDOWNS, APPEASING 'BLOODY DICTATORSHIPS'",
      "Despite Orsi's promise to lead a \"new left\" in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs that characterized the Broad Front\u2019s tenure from 2005-2020.",
      "Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began on Sunday to praise Orsi\u2019s humility and Uruguay\u2019s proud stability.",
      "\"This is no small feat,\" he said of his nation's \"citizenry that respects formal institutions.\"",
      "With inflation easing, and the economy expected to expand by some 3.2% this year, Delgado had promised to continue pursuing his predecessor\u2019s pro-business policies.",

      "Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, has enjoyed high approval ratings. But the official results trickling in on Sunday showed that mounting complaints in Uruguay about years of sluggish economic growth, stagnant wages and the government\u2019s struggle to contain crime after five years helped swing the election against Delgado.",
      "Specific proposals by Orsi include tax incentives to lure investment and revitalize the critical agricultural sector, as well as social security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay\u2019s unions that failed to pass in the Oct. 27 general election during which neither front-runner secured an outright majority.",

      "\u201cWe have a bunch of food that we\u2019ve packed away that is Thanksgiving-ish,\u201d Williams said Wednesday in an interview with NBC News. \u201cSome smoked turkey, some cranberry, apple cobbler, green beans and mushrooms and mashed potatoes.\u201d",
      "She added that she plans to tune in to the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade before feasting with her American and Russian colleagues.",
      "Williams has been living and working at the International Space Station for nearly six months. She and fellow NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore arrived at the orbiting outpost in early June, as test pilots on the first crewed flight of Boeing\u2019s Starliner space capsule.",
      "The pair planned to stay at the ISS for only about a week, then return to Earth aboard the Starliner. But problems with the spacecraft forced the duo to remain in orbit for months longer than anticipated. Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to return home in February in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.",
      "The beleaguered Starliner mission was a dramatic, monthslong saga for NASA and Boeing. But Williams said she doesn\u2019t see herself as \u201cstranded\u201d in space.",

      "In recent weeks, NASA fended off rumors that Williams had been experiencing health problems in space. Several news articles suggested the astronaut had lost a significant amount of weight, but the agency\u2019s chief health and medical officer said on Nov. 14 that Williams and the others aboard the space station remain in good health.",

      "Post-election tensions are prompting some families to rethink who will be at the Thanksgiving table this year.",
      "In the weeks after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, a fiery debate has re-emerged about whether it\u2019s fair to cut ties with loved ones due to opposing political values. While some people said they are choosing not to celebrate the upcoming holidays with family members who voted for Trump, others are lamenting being uninvited to family gatherings for supporting him.",
      "For many people, politics has always been considered a taboo subject at the dinner table. But in recent years, as the country has become more politically and culturally divided, some said it\u2019s gotten harder to face the holidays with friends and family members who don\u2019t share their political views. This animosity is a culmination of tensions that had been rising within politically divided families and friend groups ever since Trump\u2019s first victory, in 2016.",
      "A national CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last week found that 71% of people plan to avoid political discussions at Thanksgiving. Of those polled, 1 in 10 said they have changed their plans to avoid gathering with people who voted for a different presidential candidate than they did.",
      "\u201cIf somebody voted in ways that hurt you or people you love, it is 100% OK to distance yourself from them,\u201d said Alexis Voss, a stay-at-home mother in Ohio who identifies as liberal.",
      "Voss was among the dozens of people on social media who posted videos about how they are opting out of their family Thanksgiving plans. After spending eight years trying to reconcile with her largely Republican extended family, Voss said she\u2019s reached a boiling point.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a privilege to say that you think this is just about politics. \u2026 I don\u2019t think this is about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is about my morals and my basic human rights as a woman and mother.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, public figures have fanned the flames of the discourse by weighing in on the topic. One highly circulated clip showed Yale psychiatrist Amanda Calhoun telling MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid that it\u2019s \u201ccompletely fine to not be around those people and to tell them why, to say, \u2018I have a problem with the way that you voted because it went against my very livelihood. And I\u2019m not going to be around you this holiday. I need to take some space for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The comment sparked a flurry of backlash from conservatives, including Fox News host Jesse Watters, who shared on air that his mother had uninvited him from his family Thanksgiving. Elon Musk also responded to a similar debate last week, writing on X: \u201cCutting someone off just because they voted for the other candidate is close-minded and just plain mean.\u201d",
      "Jay Van Bavel, a psychology professor at New York University, said the country\u2019s division in recent years has largely been driven by hatred of the other side as opposed to love of one\u2019s own side. This is exacerbated, he said, by Trump\u2019s status as one of the most polarizing political figures in American history.",
      "Van Bavel is director of NYU\u2019s Social Identity and Morality Lab, which studies the dynamics of shared social identities. He said the lab\u2019s research shows that much of the polarization comes from massive misunderstandings about the other party\u2019s actual stances \u2014\u00a0a consequence of social media platforms\u2019 tendency to amplify the most extreme voices within either party.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s way more diversity among Republicans than most Democrats believe, and there\u2019s way more diversity among most Democrats than most Republicans believe,\u201d Van Bavel said. \u201cAnd the average member of those parties doesn\u2019t believe what we think they believe.\u201d",
      "Diana Rodriguez Wallach, a Pennsylvania-based author of young adult horror, who supported Vice President Kamala Harris, said she\u2019s skipping her family Thanksgiving to protect her mental health.",
      "\u201cWith the holiday being so close to the election, I worry that a political argument might break out that would further divide our family,\u201d said Wallach, 46, who also posted a TikTok video about her decision. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s in the best interest of our long-term relationships to take some space right now.\u201d",
      "For Wallach, voting for Trump meant voting for values and potential policies that could tangibly harm her and her family. She said that she fears how conservatives\u2019 efforts to ban books in schools and libraries under the claim of critical race theory, for example, could affect her as a Puerto Rican author.",
      "California resident Jordan Williams, who voted for Trump, said he received upward of 50 Thanksgiving invitations from strangers online after posting on TikTok that his family isn\u2019t inviting him home this year.",
      "Being the only MAGA conservative in a majority-Democratic family, Williams said, has caused a splinter between him and his loved ones. He said he voted for Trump out of a belief that he would lower prices, end veteran homelessness and address the national substance abuse crisis. Williams said his family objected to his vote, citing Trump\u2019s racist and sexist rhetoric and their belief that Trump\u2019s policies would benefit the wealthy over the common citizen.",
      "Williams, 23, said some of his family members hurled insults at him during their conversations after the election, but that he still hopes to \u201cmend the fence\u201d if they one day grow receptive.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it was crushing,\u201d he said of his newfound alienation. \u201cI\u2019m a family man, and for me to be ostracized and kicked out of family groups because of who I voted for, it really hurt me a lot.\u201d",
      "The instinct to exclude people who \u201cviolate social norms\u201d is one that\u2019s permeated societies throughout history, according to Van Bavel. But in order for a society like the United States to function, he said, people must figure out how to deal with those who fundamentally differ from themselves.",
      "One of the biggest fears people have is being socially ostracized. But in the case of politics, it might make them double down and they might decide now that you\u2019re extra crazy because you\u2019ve done this thing to exclude them.",
      "Jay Van Bavel, psychology professor at New York University",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest fears people have is being socially ostracized,\u201d Van Bavel said. \u201cBut in the case of politics, it might make them double down and they might decide now that you\u2019re extra crazy because you\u2019ve done this thing to exclude them.\u201d",
      "Because tensions are so high this year, former hostage negotiator Scott Walker, who now coaches clients on negotiation and conflict resolution, is hosting an all-day public hotline on Thanksgiving Day for families who might need help defusing political arguments.",
      "It\u2019s an idea launched by the emotion management app Ahead, which conducted an anonymous data analysis of 81,000 U.S. users and found that 44% predict more political arguments during this year\u2019s Thanksgiving than any previous Thanksgiving.",
      "For those who are planning to attend a possibly hostile Thanksgiving, Walker said it can help to prepare in advance for the hot-button topics that are likely to come up. A productive conversation can come from listening to understand an opponent\u2019s point of view, Walker said, rather than only listening to rebut. He added that it\u2019s OK to feel angry or disappointed, but that it\u2019s important not to let ego run the show.",
      "\u201cOf course, you can walk away anytime you want. No one\u2019s forcing you to engage in this,\u201d he said. But if they\u2019re willing, Walker said, politically divided families can benefit from \u201cbringing more curiosity than assumption to the table, because assumptions are like earplugs: They get in the way.\u201d"

      "A month ago, the Miami Dolphins looked lifeless in the water.",
      "Even after the return of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who sustained a concussion in Week 2 and missed four games, the team was 2-6 \u2014 seemingly closer to the No. 1 overall pick than the playoffs.",
      "Tagovailoa and the Dolphins have since caught fire, reeling off three straight wins \u2014 placing them only 1 1/2 games out of the final playoff spot in the AFC. And in the five weeks since returning, Tagovailoa has played some of the best football of his career, posting a 76.5% completion percentage, with 11 touchdowns, one interception and a 116.2 passer rating.",
      "Miami now looks much closer to the team that, albeit flawed, made the playoffs in the last two seasons. But while the last three wins have been impressive (and the two losses before both came on game-winning field goals), none of the Dolphins\u2019 five victories this year have come against a team currently with a winning record.",

      "Patrick Mahomes fined more than $14,000 for 'violent gesture' during Buffalo Bills game",
      "And that\u2019s why the Green Bay Packers will be a real test for Miami's contender status on Thursday night.",
      "The Dolphins will be looking to squash multiple criticisms on Thanksgiving. Can Tagovailoa beat a winning team? Can Miami win in prime time? Can the offense thrive in cold weather?",
      "The Packers, in many ways, serve as a foil to the Dolphins.",
      "Quarterback Jordan Love (who was in the same 2020 draft class as Tagovailoa) doesn\u2019t have as long a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but he may have a more impressive one.",
      "Last season, his first as a starter, Love rescued a 2-5 Green Bay team, leading it to a 7-3 record (and playoff berth) down the stretch. That run included two monster wins \u2014 on the road against the Detroit Lions, and at home against the Kansas City Chiefs on \"Sunday Night Football.\"",
      "All seven of those wins came in November, December and January. And for good measure, Love and the Packers also went on the road and upset the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the playoffs.",
      "That\u2019s roughly the inverse of how Miami finished last year. The Dolphins started 8-3, limped to a 3-3 finish, and were then blown out by the Chiefs in the postseason.",
      "This season, it\u2019s Green Bay that has raced out to an 8-3 start. The Packers are fifth in total offense and eighth in scoring. And Love is tied for sixth in the NFL with 18 passing touchdowns despite missing multiple games with a knee injury.",
      "Unlike the Dolphins, who went 1-3 without Tagovailoa for four games, Green Bay found ways to win without Love, going 2-0 in his absence. A key reason for that success was the Packers\u2019 strong rushing attack, third-best in the league.",
      "Miami has had high-profile opportunities to prove its mettle before, but squandered nearly all of them. Last season, the Dolphins lost on the road to the Philadelphia Eagles on \"Sunday Night Football,\" to Kansas City in Germany, and the Buffalo Bills in a de facto AFC East championship game in Week 18. Those were the kinds of games Love and Green Bay were winning down the stretch.",
      "Ultimately, Tagovailoa\u2019s play over the last five weeks is nothing to scoff at, especially considering the frightening nature of what was at least his third concussion as a professional earlier this season. But if he and the Dolphins want to keep their playoff hopes alive, they need to beat a Packers team that\u2019s proven to be a step ahead of them."

    "story": [
      "While Thanksgiving may be cool and rainy  in many spots across the country, solar storms could offer a glimpse at the northern lights for some in the U.S.",
      "Minor to moderate geomagnetic storms are likely Thursday and Friday, thanks to a filament eruption on Monday, during which the sun shot a cloud of high-energy plasma toward Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "That eruption is now ushering in the possibility that night skies in the U.S. could light up in greens, reds and purples for the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "How bright the auroras are and how long they remain in the skies depends on how strong the solar storms get, and whether they reach G1 or G2 conditions at all, NOAA meteorologist Mike Bettwy said in an email.",
      "\"This is not expected to be a widespread event and will likely only last for short intervals and could be quite faint in the affected locales,\" Bettwy said.",
      "Those in states such as Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine are poised to see the northern lights this holiday weekend, and those in northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire have a chance at seeing the aurora borealis as well, according to NOAA.",
      "The aurora borealis is most likely to be visible Thursday evening until early Friday, when NOAA experts are forecasting minor (G1) and moderate (G2) geomagnetic storms, though it is not clear exactly when and where the skies will light up.",
      "Viewers hoping to catch a glimpse can track the latest activity and forecast on the NOAA's Aurora Dashboard. It also offers short-term forecasts of the northern lights, including maps of where they will be visible and\u00a0experimental tools\u00a0that estimate their intensity.",
      "Clear conditions are best to take a peek at the bright lights. Areas of cloudiness are likely to limit viewing possibilities over much of the Northeast and New England, and near the Great Lakes, Bettwy said.",
      "Unlike stronger solar storms that offered many in the U.S. a view of the northern lights earlier this year, Bettwy said don't expect any major disruptions to communications systems in the country this time around, unless the storms turn out to be more significant than predicted.",
      "The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are usually seen only at high altitudes, but intense enough solar storms can make them visible in areas much farther south than normal.",
      "These solar storms take place when coronal mass ejections, or eruptions from the sun, send giant clouds of plasma into space. When those plasma clouds are directed at Earth, the plumes of charged particles smash into the planet's magnetic field and interact with atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere which create radiant auroras.",
      "The sun goes through roughly 11-year cycles of activity, from minimum to maximum. It's gearing up for an expected peak next July, according to the NOAA, which is why there have been a number of occasions this year in which the northern lights have been visible so far south."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office next year, U.S.-China relations are poised to be one of the greatest foreign policy challenges for the new administration.",
      "In recent years, the relationship between the world\u2019s two dominant superpowers has been fraught, with lawmakers across the political spectrum adopting a tougher stance on Beijing. What direction that relationship takes now, experts say, will depend on the extent to which Trump follows through on his vow to slap China with steep tariffs \u2014 as well as how strongly he is influenced by advisers who think the U.S. should confront China on far more than trade.",
      "Tariffs 2.0",
      "Trump already rattled global markets this week by saying he would begin his term in office with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, in addition to higher tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. During the campaign, he floated imposing tariffs of at least 60% on China, which some economists have warned could lead to higher prices for American consumers.",
      "Steep tariffs could \u201cundoubtedly terrify investors and have a massive impact on the stock market,\u201d said Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "Tariffs may also set off another \u201ctrade war\u201d with China, mirroring Trump\u2019s first term when Washington and Beijing imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on each other, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhat would happen is, the U.S. would put on tariffs, and then China would put on tariffs in a bunch of places really important to Republican constituencies,\u201d Kurlantzick said.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said his nominee for U.S. trade representative was Jamieson Greer, who helped implement China tariffs during Trump\u2019s first term as chief of staff to Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative at the time.",
      "Analysts warned that the consequences of tariffs could go beyond the economy, potentially affecting national security and health issues.",
      "Steep tariffs could make Beijing wary about cooperating with the U.S. on joint issues, such as cracking down on precursor chemicals for fentanyl, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "\u201cIf the Chinese are suffering 60% tariffs across the board, the likelihood of their wanting to cooperate in other realms of the relationship goes down dramatically,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said.",
      "Responding to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Monday, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that \u201cno one will win a trade war.\u201d",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden this month that he was ready to work with the incoming Trump administration and that he hopes for a stable and constructive relationship. But in a seeming message to Trump, he emphasized China\u2019s four \u201cred lines\u201d in its U.S. relations: Taiwan, the promotion of democracy and human rights, efforts to undermine the ruling Chinese Communist Party, and constraining China\u2019s development.",
      "Asked for comment on the future of U.S.-China relations, Liu pointed to comments this month by Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., who said China \u201chas no plan to overtake or displace the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will also have no intention to contain or suppress China,\u201d Xie said, according to the embassy\u2019s transcript.",
      "The first six months of next year will be crucial for setting the tone in U.S.-China relations, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. He said Trump and Xi should try to meet as soon as possible, citing what Trump describes as his strong relationship with the Chinese leader.",
      "Trump is not dealing with the same China as when he left office four years ago. Though Xi, who began a historic third term in office last year, has further consolidated power, his focus will be on addressing an economic slowdown that would only get worse with international instability.",
      "At the same time, however, China has also made significant technological advances in key sectors such as electric vehicles and has diversified its trading relationships to become less reliant on the U.S., its top export market.",
      "Chinese officials seem prepared to work with the Trump administration to \u201cfind an off-ramp before things go sour,\u201d Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, told NBC News in an interview last week during a visit to the Chinese capital, Beijing.",
      "But if Trump does impose extremely high tariffs or take other measures, Beijing could \u201cmake things challenging for the U.S. as well,\u201d he said.",
      "That could mean retaliatory tariffs on agricultural and other U.S. products, investigations into American companies operating in China, restrictions on rare earths and other critical Chinese exports, or weakening the yuan to undermine U.S. trade.",
      "Incoming White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was elected \"to stand up to China, enforce tariffs on Chinese goods, and Make America Strong Again. He will deliver.\"",
      "A hawkish Trump team",
      "It\u2019s unclear just how much Trump will be influenced by his advisers. Many of his picks so far are staunch critics of China, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state; Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security adviser; and Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense.",
      "Rubio, who championed legislation authorizing sanctions on officials accused of rights abuses in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong and the Chinese region of Xinjiang, is himself sanctioned by the Chinese government, which would be a first for a secretary of state if he is confirmed.",
      "His selection by Trump \u201chas instilled some confidence in pro-democracy communities in China and the diaspora, as Rubio is known for his strong objections to Beijing\u2019s human rights abuses,\u201d Yaqiu Wang, the research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at\u00a0Freedom\u00a0House, a Washington think tank, wrote in The Diplomat on Tuesday.",
      "Waltz, who does not need to be confirmed by the Senate, had called on the U.S. to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing human rights abuses, while Hegseth, a Fox News host, has said China aspires to global domination.",
      "Rubio and Waltz \u201chave a very realistic and sober notion of the challenges ahead with respect to China, and on that front, I think they\u2019ll serve President Trump very well,\u201d said Dan Blumenthal, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "But Trump and his aides also have major differences in their approach to China, including whether to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok, which Trump supported before reversing his position this year.",
      "They also may diverge on Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that Beijing claims as its territory. Trump has unnerved Taiwanese officials by saying the island doesn\u2019t pay enough for its defense and accusing it of \u201cstealing\u201d business from the U.S. with its semiconductor industry.",
      "Experts say Trump may be more transactional in how he deals with China and Taiwan than his advisers, whose approach tends to be more ideological.",
      "Trump \u201cstill wants to get concessions from China, he wants to get benefits from China,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut for those people, they just want to promote decoupling. They just want to contain China and defeat China, and even to provoke conflict with China.\u201d",
      "Chinese officials looking for friendlier intermediaries may turn to others in Trump\u2019s orbit such as Tesla owner Elon Musk, who has extensive business interests in China and often meets with senior Chinese leaders.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope here that he can be a bridge and help keep things calm,\u201d Kennedy said, though \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is more wishful thinking than clear analysis.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump handed Ron DeSantis a political gift this month when he gave him a U.S. Senate seat to fill.",
      "Just don\u2019t expect the Florida governor to open it before Christmas.",
      "One of Trump's first major picks to fill his Cabinet was Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, as the president-elect stocks his nascent administration with political leaders from the state. The nomination will open up Rubio\u2019s seat, quickly stirring speculation about whom DeSantis would pick and how involved Trump, the state's most famous resident, will be in the process.",
      "Roughly two weeks after the Rubio announcement, however, DeSantis\u2019 team is still working through its options and does not plan to show its hand for at least a month, according to five people familiar with the process.",
      "\u201cThe governor will be conducting a thorough vetting process and interview process in December that will involve several candidates,\u201d a DeSantis adviser told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s not in a hurry to make an important decision.\u201d",
      "The governor has said he plans to make his selection by the beginning of January.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the Rubio pick, two schools of thought emerged: DeSantis could appoint a placeholder who would serve until the terms ends and then run for the Senate himself in 2026 ahead of a likely 2028 presidential bid, or pick someone to serve in the seat for the long term.",
      "On that first choice, there appears to be resolution. DeSantis, two sources tell NBC News, is not likely to seek the Senate seat in 2026 or appoint himself to the spot, which is allowed. DeSantis does not appear poised to head to the Senate and has for now taken his name off the board.",
      "\u201cThe governor is not looking for a placeholder and seems unlikely to pursue the Senate himself,\u201d a Florida Republican close to DeSantis\u2019 team said.",
      "The next layer of intrigue that DeSantis must navigate is whether to placate Trump and his political team by appointing Lara Trump, the president-elect\u2019s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Trump himself has not chimed in directly, but several of his top supporters quickly floated Lara\u2019s name after it was clear Rubio\u2019s seat would become vacant, including Elon Musk, who has been at Trump\u2019s side since election night.",
      "For her part, Lara Trump has done little to downplay the rumors.",
      "\u201cIf I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor,\u201d she told Fox News over the weekend. \u201cI have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me.\u201d",
      "The Trump political team's pushing for DeSantis to appoint one of its own has once again opened up a complicated dynamic between the governor and the president-elect. The two men had a well-known allegiance after Trump endorsed DeSantis for governor in 2018, but that has since deteriorated after DeSantis unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.",
      "Trump, however, has become actively involved in Florida politics, and his presence now complicates many decisions that would ordinarily seem more cut-and-dry.",
      "\u201cLara Trump or not Lara Trump, that\u2019s the biggest question for him at this point,\u201d a longtime Florida Republican and DeSantis ally said. \u201cClearly Trump and his world wants Lara Trump, but does he [DeSantis] do that? Will he cave? It\u2019s unclear.\u201d",
      "The lens through which DeSantis is viewing the decision is relatively straightforward: 2028.",
      "If DeSantis gives Trump his pick, he may be less likely to face fierce pushback from the MAGA base during another potential presidential run. Conversely, if he bucks the president-elect, it could signal an erosion of the public truce the two sides have built since DeSantis left the presidential race in January.",
      "\u201cIt colors everything,\u201d the Florida operative close to DeSantis said. \u201cIf you believe it is important to not cross Trump, and I think most would agree with that, then all these things have to be viewed through that.\u201d",
      "If DeSantis decides not to pick Lara Trump, there is a growing number of potential state-level candidates populating the current short list, including Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, Attorney General Ashley Moody, former House Speaker Paul Renner, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, former House Speaker Jose Oliva and DeSantis chief of staff James Uthmeier.",
      "Each have been staunch DeSantis allies and are well-known Florida Republicans likely to get through the interview and vetting process. Moody, in particular, has stirred speculation because Uthmeier, an attorney and top DeSantis political and policy adviser, has shown interest in being appointed Florida attorney general.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been pretty open about it, and it\u2019s not a terribly well-kept secret,\u201d a longtime Florida lobbyist said of Uthmeier. \u201cNo idea if he will get there, but it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where he would like to go.\u201d",
      "Uthmeier didn't respond to a request for comment on the attorney general prospect for this article.",
      "DeSantis is not considering any Republicans from Florida\u2019s congressional delegation in large part because of the GOP\u2019s thin majority in the House \u2014 a margin made even smaller by Trump picking lawmakers for his administration, including Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to serve as national security adviser. He also initially nominated former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general; Gaetz has since withdrawn his name from consideration and said he will not return to Congress next year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think DeSantis wants to impact the Republican majority,\u201d a DeSantis ally familiar with his thinking said. \u201cIf there is a [Florida] member of Congress being considered, I don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:08:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Several of President-elect Donald Trump's planned Cabinet nominees and administration appointees were subjected to bomb threats and \"swatting\" attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Several of President-elect Donald Trump's planned Cabinet nominees and administration appointees were subjected to bomb threats and \"swatting\" attacks Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team said.",
      "The nominees and appointees \"were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them. These attacks ranged from bomb threats to \u2018swatting,\u2019\" transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "Swatting is when\u00a0a hoax call is made to police claiming a life-threatening situation is taking place. It is meant to draw SWAT teams to a location and can lead to deadly outcomes.",
      "Three senior law enforcement officials briefed on the swatting incident involving multiple Trump allies told NBC News that these were not credible threats. No devices or physical threats were found and some of the threats may have come in over social media, the officials said. The threats did not involve U.S. Secret Service protectees such as Trump or Vice President-elect JD Vance.",
      "The FBI said in a statement it \u201cis aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners. We take all potential threats seriously, and as always, encourage members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The Trump statement did not identify exactly who or how many incoming officials were subjected to the hoax but said \"law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted.\"",
      "\"President Trump and the entire Transition team are grateful for their swift action,\" the statement said.",
      "The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the threats and that the administration \"is in touch with federal law enforcement and the President-elect\u2019s team, and continues to monitor the situation closely. Federal law enforcement\u2019s response, alongside state and local authorities, remains ongoing. The President and the Administration unequivocally condemn threats of political violence.\u201d",
      "Among those who said they were targeted are Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to be ambassador to the United Nations; former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who's been selected to head the Environmental Protection Agency; Brooke Rollins, Trump's pick for the Department of Agriculture; and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Trump choice for U.S. attorney general who withdrew his name from consideration last week.",
      "Stefanik's office said in a statement that Stefanik, R-N.Y., her husband and their three-year-old son were driving home from Washington \"when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence. New York State, County law enforcement, and U.S. Capitol Police responded immediately with the highest levels of professionalism.\"",
      "Zeldin, a former New York GOP congressman, said in a statement that a\"pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message. My family and I were not home at the time and are safe. We are working with law enforcement to learn more as this situation develops.\"",
      "Rollins tweeted that \"a threat was issued against our home and family. Thanks to the swift efforts by the @fortworthpd, we were unharmed and quickly returned home.\"",
      "Gaetz, R-Fla., confirmed to NBC News that he was also among the targets.",
      "A bomb squad reported to his home in Florida in response to the threat. Initially, a bomb-sniffing dog was brought to his home by the sheriff but was inconclusive, which led to the bomb squad being called in.",
      "The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said \"no devices were located. The immediate area was also searched with negative results.\"",
      "Gaetz said he was not home at the time but a family member was. The details of the Gaetz threat were first reported by Punchbowl News.",
      "Pete Hegseth, who is Trump's pick for defense secretary, said in a post to X that a police officer informed him Wednesday morning that there was a \"pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family.\" Hegseth added that his family is safe \"and the threat has been cleared.\"",
      "\"I will not be bullied or intimidated. Never,\" Hegseth continued. \"President Trump has called on me to serve\u2014and that is what I intend to do.\"",
      "Leavitt's statement said the threats would not slow them down. \"With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us,\u201d she said.",
      "The same tactics have been used in the past against some of those who've been viewed as Trump adversaries, including the judge who presided over his civil fraud trial in New York, the judge who presided over Trump's federal election interference case and the prosecutor who brought that case, special counsel Jack Smith, as well as the district attorney's office in Georgia and New York that brought criminal cases against Trump.",
      "Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle condemned the incidents.",
      "\"Violence has no place in our politics. Period,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a post to X. \"Law enforcement will work to keep everyone safe, and those responsible must be held fully accountable.\"",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said in a post to X that the threats were \"extremely dangerous and completely unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Praying for the safety of President Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees and administration appointees,\" Tuberville added."

      "An image from Gloria Holland\u2019s childhood remains clear in her mind: a man dressed only in his underwear, standing outside his front door pleading that his house in the Section 14 area of Palm Springs, California, not be demolished. The man ranted for several minutes until a bulldozer leveled the structure and he scampered to safety.",
      "\u201cI was 8 or 9 years old,\u201d Holland, now 70, said from her home outsideAtlanta. \u201cIt was the first time I saw a grown man cry. It was traumatizing.\u201d",
      "The man and Holland were among 195 Black and Latino families whose homes were bulldozed and burned to the ground with little-to-no notice in the late 1950s and early \u201960s. The land, owned by Native Americans, had always been coveted by city officials, who wanted Palm Springs\u2019 downtown area to grow with luxury hotels and shops in building up a city known as a celebrity playground about 115 miles east of Hollywood.",
      "\u201cOn Friday, we were notified that we had to take anything we wanted out of the house by Monday \u2014 two days,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThat was it. It was awful.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the Section 14 Survivors Group filed a complaint against the city, seeking restitution for the hundreds of homes lost and lives suddenly upended. Earlier this month, the Palm Springs City Council unanimously voted to approve a multilevel settlement offer to former residents and descendants of those who lived in the Black and Latino neighborhood.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the city of Palm Springs to compensate individuals for the destruction of personal property,\u201d said Councilmember Lisa Middleton during the hearing. \u201cWe broke something that was yours, and now we need to pay for it.\u201d",
      "As part of the settlement, 1,200 people will share $5.9 million in direct cash payments. The city also agreed to explore naming a community park in honor of the displaced, a public monument to the legacy of the former residents, and to establish a cultural healing center. The City Council also approved $21 million in housing and economic development programs to address past discrimination against its Black and Latino residents, which includes $10 million for a first-time homebuyer assistance program and $10 million to establish a community land trust.",
      "The city will also fund a $1 million small business program designed for \u201cempowering local business initiatives for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a journey full of emotions, from sadness, anger, frustration to exhilaration,\u201d said Areva Martin, the attorney who represented the Section 14 Survivors for two years in their pursuit for justice. \u201cI knew that the conversation around reparations is a difficult one for a lot of people, particularly older Black people, many of whom have experienced so much racial trauma, but have been conditioned to live with it, not to complain about it, to repress it, and in some ways ignore it.\u201d",
      "To assure the City Council understood the impact of the displacement, Martin said she worked to convince her clients to \u201ctell their stories in ways that they had not before, because many of these people had never said out loud what happened to them. They hadn\u2019t told their children or their grandchildren. They definitely hadn\u2019t talked about it in a public forum. But I knew that to heal and to move forward, we needed to acknowledge the harms of the past.\u201d",
      "Doing so was difficult, Holland said. \u201cGoing through this situation brought up a lot of emotions and memories I had put away in the back of my mind,\u201d she said.",
      "Digging back to the past seemed to traumatize her all over again.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of my neighbors felt the same way,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they had similar stories and I could look in their faces and see that they were seeing it all over again.\u201d",
      "Holland said her parents tried to shield the extreme nature of the displacement from her and to create normalcy.",
      "\u201cWe were fortunate enough to be building a new home and my mother would take me there to see it under construction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted my old home back. We had a community there. It was an idyllic place to live. We felt protected. No drugs. No crime. And they just took all that from us.\u201d",
      "Section 14, a square mile piece of land, was owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Because of racial covenants in the 1940, it was among the few places Black and Latino residents could live in Palm Springs. In 1959, the federal government opened up leasing agreements for the Agua Caliente Band and other tribes for up to 99 years, which sparked the interest of commercial real estate developers. Residents worked in various professions to help build and maintain the Palm Springs infrastructure: carpenters, plumbers, construction workers, maids, chefs, gardeners and others in domestic jobs.",
      "Despite that, the city, eyeing luxury tourism, gained control of the land from the tribe through a conservatorship and ordered the fire department to knock down and burn the homes.",
      "In 1969, a California \u00a0attorney general\u2019s report described what happened at Section 14 as a \u201ccity-engineered holocaust.\u201d",
      "Pearl Devers led the Section 14 Survivors group, starting in 2021, demanding that the city pay for the harms of destroying their community. She fought for her parents, who \u201csuffered more than we did,\u201d Devers said. \u201cThe adults lived through that madness. It tore our family apart.\u201d",
      "Her mother was a maid who worked at one time for legendary actress Lucille Ball. Her father built their home in Section 14. But when they were displaced, her father was rejected for a loan to buy another home.",
      "Devers\u2019 mother told her the pressures from redlining and racism led her father to alcohol. \u201cOur family was crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad never recovered from drinking.\u201d He died at 68.",
      "Devers said her brothers \u201cmissed having their father around,\u201d without getting specific. She said she often wonders what her and family\u2019s life would be like if they were never forced from their homes.",
      "So does Lawrence Williams, 77, who now lives in Columbia, Mississippi. He was \u201c10 or 11\u201d when he opened his front door to a man who operated a yellow bulldozer. Williams got his mother, Lucille McFarland, who was told they had the weekend to pack up before he returned on Monday morning to destroy their home.",
      "\u201cI still remember my mother sitting at that table crying,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother was a maid and made $1.35 an hour; she didn\u2019t have money to just up and move. She didn\u2019t have a car.\u201d",
      "Williams and his younger brother went to a nearby store and brought back some boxes. They helped their mother pack up what they could. Devers\u2019 mom took Williams\u2019 mother house hunting, but it was difficult. She finally landed a place about 15 miles north of Palm Springs in a man\u2019s hunting trailer that had no bathroom or kitchen. They had to use the bathroom of the neighboring gas station. They endured those conditions for three months before finding a permanent place with more help from Dever\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cTraumatizing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI feared that whole summer that I was going to end up having to go to school there, an all-white school. Talking about this is like an old wound that starts bleeding again.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:22:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16, in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16, in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal party, passed the Australian House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in the Department of Media and Communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the United States, which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions on it during the one-day period and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it. Yet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report.",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, on Tuesday had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "An Australian Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after verifying the age of users.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say that social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The Australian government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of their daily lives, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at the Queensland University of Technology, said the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and lacked critical details on how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media cited by the government are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus told NBC News in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also noted that the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",
      "\u201cThese features are likely to end up resulting in the very downsides we are trying to avoid for our children: preoccupation with devices, less sleep, less nature, less sport, less real-life friendships, less concentration, exposure to sexualized content,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 A major home warranty provider is under scrutiny from customers who say it isn\u2019t living up to its promises to fix or replace broken appliances.",
      "American Home Shield (AHS) is one of the nation\u2019s leading providers of home warranty plans, boasting over 2.2 million subscribers. Frontdoor, the business\u2019 publicly traded parent company, reported nearly $1.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023, up 7% from the year before, and executives have touted AHS to investors for maintaining \u201cits category leading share of warranties attached to home purchases\u201d this year.",
      "That\u2019s partly thanks to a recent marketing campaign starring \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Rachel Dratch, which the company said has helped jolt the public\u2019s brand awareness of AHS from 39% two years ago to 54% now. In the TV commercials, Dratch plays \u201cWarrantina,\u201d a sometime fortune teller who urges clients to \u201cprotect their covered appliances and home systems\u201d from future malfunctions, like leaky refrigerator coils and broken air-conditioning fans.",
      "But some customers say they\u2019ve had a hard time getting AHS to respond to common issues like those. They accuse the company of failing to make good on its promise to provide covered repairs for at least 23 home appliances \u2014 no matter the age, condition or repair history \u2014 even those with undetectable, pre-existing problems.",
      "Julian Sanchez had been an AHS customer for nearly three years when the air conditioning system in his Las Vegas home broke down in May. The company sent a third-party repair technician to inspect the damaged 15-year-old unit, he said, only to leave it in worse shape.",
      "\u201cThey removed a piece of my AC unit and left it on the roof,\u201d said Sanchez, 34. \u201cI expected it would be a quick diagnostic and a fix. What I got was the complete opposite.\u201d",
      "Sanchez said he\u2019d always paid his monthly premiums of up to $72.99 in full and on time. But he said most of his daily calls to American Home Shield went unanswered, including after being placed on hold for over 45 minutes. When he finally reached a live operator, Sanchez said the person seemed uninformed and insufficiently trained to address his needs.",
      "\u201cOnce you connect to somebody, they have to push it up the chain,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just continually put you in a runaround.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Sanchez and his wife, Patrician Nunez, 29, spent most days and nights with their five children on the ground floor of their home to stay cool. This summer saw scorching temperatures in the Las Vegas area, which has clocked 112 days over 100 degrees this year, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "I expected it would be a quick diagnostic and a fix. What I got was the complete opposite.",
      "AHS customer Julian Sanchez",
      "\u201cMost of the time in this room, it would reach onwards of the high nineties to the low hundreds,\u201d Sanchez said during a tour of the upstairs bedrooms.",
      "\u201cThere was no way we could be up there,\u201d Nunez added. \u201cWe would have sleepovers in our living rooms because our daughters couldn\u2019t sleep in the bedroom. It was just way too hot.\u201d",
      "More repair technicians were dispatched over the ensuing six weeks. One refused to even look at the AC system because it had been disassembled, Sanchez said. Another concluded the damage was due to \u201cforeign debris,\u201d rather than the normal wear and tear covered by his contract.",
      "New York-based consumer-rights attorney Alexander Bachuwa said that\u2019s a common response from AHS.",
      "\u201cEvery single case I have is the same: They come out there, they diagnose the problem and they say, \u2018Not normal wear and tear,\u2019\u201d said Bachuwa, who has filed at least 50 claims and won over $44,000 for American Home Shield customers in the last few years. \u201cThey will find a way to deny your claim.\u201d",
      "AHS said it concluded after three separate inspections of Sanchez\u2019s air conditioner that \u201cthe correct coverage decision was made.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe take great pride in providing quality service and protection to our members,\u201d a company spokesperson said, adding that AHS has fielded over 319,000 service requests in the Las Vegas area, paying out more than $56 million between January 2022 and September 2024. \u201cWe are disappointed Mr. Sanchez\u2019s expectations were not met.\u201d",
      "AHS said it refunded Sanchez a $125 service fee as an accommodation measure and ultimately offered to repair his air conditioner free of charge. Sanchez declined. Instead, he\u2019s working with Bachuwa to push for a full replacement of his unit, at an estimated cost of at least $12,500. Sanchez says the system could have been fixed for far less when he filed his original claim.",
      "Every single case I have is the same: They come out there, they diagnose the problem and they say, \u2018Not normal wear and tear.\u2019",
      "consumer-rights attorney Alexander Bachuwa",
      "Many unhappy customers have little other recourse but to pursue a case in small-claims court or file an arbitration claim, Bachuwa said: \u201cThere are no class actions, per the terms and conditions in AHS\u2019s contract, meaning each consumer must file an individual claim.\u201d",
      "AHS is rated 2 out of 5 stars on the Better Business Bureau\u2019s website, which catalogs nearly 21,000 complaints against the company in the past three years. BBB spokesperson Melanie McGovern urged prospective customers of home warranty firms to look closely at their options before signing on the dotted line.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing consumers need to do is read the entire contract,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to understand everything that it does and doesn\u2019t cover, read the complaint data, read the reviews, and then make their purchasing decision from there. Did the company respond? Did they get it all settled?\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Sanchez said he wants AHS to take customers\u2019 complaints more seriously and reconsider what it deems normal wear and tear on common appliances.",
      "\u201cI hope that they take the time to actually hear people, because it\u2019s not just me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a lot of families in really tough situations.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "North Carolina stopped covering weight loss drugs such as Ozempic for state employees without diabetes. But it extended coverage for Medicaid recipients.",
    "story": [
      "After losing and regaining the same 20-plus pounds more times than she could count, Anita Blanchard concluded that diets don\u2019t work.",
      "So when the University of North Carolina-Charlotte professor learned that Ozempic \u2014 developed to treat Type 2 diabetes \u2014 helped people lose weight and keep it off, Blanchard was determined to try it.",
      "The state employee\u2019s health insurance initially covered the prescription with Blanchard kicking in a $25 copayment. Over the next seven months, she said, she lost 45 pounds and lowered her blood pressure and cholesterol. The most significant benefits, though, were psychological.",
      "\u201cIt stopped the food noise in my head, relieved my anxiety, and I was no longer drinking like a fish,\u201d said Blanchard, now 60. \u201cI\u2019d have a glass of wine, and then that\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "But North Carolina suffered from sticker shock as Blanchard shed pounds and thousands of others on the state insurance program \u2014 which covers more than 76,000 employees across 178 agencies, plus their dependents \u2014 tried to do the same. Ozempic and other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GPL-1) agonist medications accounted for 10% of the state employee health plan\u2019s annual prescription drug spending, according to a North Carolina State Health Plan fact sheet. The state treasurer projected the class of drugs would cost the state more than $170 million this year, with costs jumping to more than $1 billion over the next six years.",
      "\u201cThis exceeds the amount the State Health Plan spends on cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and chemotherapy medications,\u201d the State Health Plan said in a March statement.",
      "The health plan\u2019s board of trustees eliminated coverage of this class of medications for weight loss starting in April. The plan continues to cover the drug for Type 2 diabetes management.",
      "But in a twist this August, a separate part of North Carolina\u2019s government allowed the Medicaid program to start covering the drugs for weight loss \u2014 not just diabetes \u2014 for the state\u2019s poorest residents, who are disproportionately affected by obesity and related diseases. The state\u2019s Medicaid program covers more than 2 million people but doesn\u2019t include state employees such as Blanchard.",
      "And now the outgoing Biden administration wants to follow suit, proposing on Nov. 26 for the federal government to cover the medications to treat obesity or Medicaid patients nationwide, in addition to Medicare patients.",
      "Still, the North Carolina coverage change left state employees like Blanchard facing a stark choice \u2014 stop taking what she views as a miracle drug or pay as much as $1,200 out-of-pocket each month.",
      "\u201cThey know diets don\u2019t work long-term for weight loss, yet they are denying coverage for a medication that has been effective,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cIt\u2019s indicative of a profit-driven mindset that is more about cost savings than prioritizing patients\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "The coverage switch highlights concerns about the cost of these medications and ongoing questions about who should get to have such drugs covered by insurance.",
      "Several other states are also trying to reel in the expense of the medications. West Virginia canceled its pilot program to cover the drugs for its state employees. Connecticut state employees who are prescribed the drugs must participate in a clinical lifestyle management program.",
      "The high prices have also raised concerns about the cost for other taxpayer-funded health care programs, such as Medicare. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimated that coverage under the Biden proposal would cost about $40 billion over 10 years, including an extra $3.8 billion for states. But the requirement wouldn\u2019t take effect until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office Jan. 20, giving his administration a chance to change it.",
      "GLP-1 agonist medications, known by the brand names Ozempic, Trulicity and Wegovy, have proved to be effective for weight loss as well as managing Type 2 diabetes. They work by triggering the pancreas to release insulin, slowing the rate at which the stomach empties, increasing satiety and regulating appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is satisfied. But patients typically need to stay on the medications to maintain their weight loss, meaning they face long-term costs.",
      "In clinical trials, patients taking Ozempic also showed significant reductions in cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes, even those without diabetes, or before weight loss started, said Duke University cardiologist and researcher Dr. Nishant Shah.",
      "Making these drugs available through Medicaid is in the state\u2019s long-term financial interest, said Kody Kinsley, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, which doesn\u2019t oversee the state employee health plan. Unlike private or employer insurance plans, the Medicaid program receives generous rebates on these types of drugs, significantly reducing the cost, he said.",
      "Calling North Carolina the buckle of the \u201cBarbecue Belt,\u201d Kinsley noted that state\u2019s obesity rate exceeds the national average. The latest analysis from NORC research organization at the University of Chicago showed that 45% of adults in the state had a body mass index above 30, the threshold for clinical obesity, compared with 42% nationwide. That number was 55% for non-Hispanic Black adults in the state.",
      "In addition, Kinsley said, with Medicaid the primary payer for long-term care, covering the drugs helps Medicaid\u2019s bottom line by reducing the need for nursing home care often driven by unmanaged chronic diseases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put our dollars where they will lower costs in the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend almost a billion dollars a year on obesity-related diseases. If I can reduce that spend by even 1%, then these drugs are a no-brainer.\u201d",
      "But what about people who aren\u2019t on Medicaid? Duke\u2019s Shah said the U.S. health care system needs to eliminate hurdles that make it difficult to obtain the drugs. Besides making the medication more affordable, he said, it should encourage the use of weight loss drugs and treatment of obesity as a chronic disease instead of stigmatizing it as a moral failing.",
      "\u201cWhether it is drug cost, conditions that require the payer to approve them, the patient\u2019s health insurance plan, or the unaffordability of a plan that would cover weight loss, there are real-world barriers in our health care system,\u201d Shah said.",
      "Family medicine physician Dr. Melissa Jones of Charlotte said she has often seen a bias against people in her weight management practice when they try to get these medications covered by private insurance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in saying \u2018I have high blood pressure\u2019 or \u2018I inherited this condition from my family,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut for some reason, there\u2019s shame associated with saying, \u2018I struggle with my weight.\u2019\u201d",
      "Although Blanchard can\u2019t get her Ozempic covered anymore as a state employee, a concierge doctor gave her a prescription for a nonbrand version of the anti-obesity medications from a compounding pharmacy, available for now because of shortages of the brand-name versions. Though she believes it is less effective, she pays $225 a month for it.",
      "\u201cI can handle that,\u201d she said."

      "Officers attempted to tackle the blaze, \u201cbut the fire was too intense for the extinguishers to be effective,\u201d he said. The Piedmont Fire Department then arrived and put out the fire.",
      "\u201cTragically this collision resulted in three people losing their lives. One individual was seriously injured and taken to an area hospital,\u201d Bowers added.",
      "Police received an iPhone notification about the crash at 3:08 a.m. and someone called 911 two minutes later, when officers were already on the scene, he said.",
      "\u201cOur women and men who responded to this call did everything they could. And it\u2019s devastating. But the devastation pales into comparison to what these families are dealing with this morning, the day before Thanksgiving,\u201d he added.",

      "A nearby motorist who saw the car on fire was able to reach the vehicle and rescue the injured man, Bowers said.",
      "Aileen DeSoto, a friend of the family of the man being treated in hospital, told NBC Bay Area he had undergone surgery and was in recovery.",
      "An investigation is underway into the cause of the crash, in collaboration with California Highway Patrol, but Bowers said it was possible that the victims had attended a local function.

      "Sandy Martin, who taught some of the victims in Middle School, told NBC Bay Area: \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t happen to any kid. But when you know them, it just makes it worse.\u201d",
      "The city of Piedmont plans to go ahead with its traditional Thanksgiving Turkey Trot, a 5 kilometer run or walk, NBC Bay Area reported, adding it would be preceded by remarks about the crash from Mayor Jen Cavenaugh and a moment of silence."

      "\u201cThe pole he was using was about 34 feet long, and it came in either close proximity or actually touched a primary line that was only a few feet from the tree,\u201d said Gover. \u201cAnd he got zapped from that.\u201d",

      "The filing is part of a lawsuit Morrissey filed against A&E Television Networks, Lifetime Entertainment Services, and others in connection with the release of the docuseries \u201cWhere is Wendy Williams?\u201d in February.",
      "In the Nov. 12 memo, attorneys for Morrissey asked the court to approve some redactions of sensitive, \u201cnon-public information\u201d to the defense's portion of a joint status letter in Williams' guardianship case to protect her privacy. That case is under seal.",
      "It said that the proposed redactions \u201care very narrowly drawn and do not undermine the public\u2019s ability to understand the core facts and legal arguments at issue in this litigation.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Williams\u2019 bank, Wells Fargo, petitioned to have her placed under financial guardianship, claiming she was \u201cincapacitated\u201d and \u201ca victim of undue influence and financial exploitation.\u201d Williams later pushed back against those claims.",

      "Speculation about Williams\u2019 health began in 2017, after she fainted live on the air.",
      "Williams has been open with her audience about her struggles with addiction.

      "Williams was also absent from her show in 2021 and 2022 because of health reasons, Variety reported. Sherri Shepherd took over the time slot in 2022, before \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d was eventually canceled.",
      "In the time that she was off air, Wells Fargo petitioned that Williams receive financial guardianship.",
      "Williams essentially retired from the public eye in 2022.",
      "In the suit filed by Morrissey, she claims that those involved with the docuseries took advantage of a \"vulnerable\" Williams \u201cin the cruelest, most obscene way possible for their own financial gain.\u201d",
      "\"As is patently obvious from the very first few minutes of the Program itself, W.W.H. was highly vulnerable and clearly incapable of consenting to being filmed, much less humiliated and exploited,\" the complaint in the case said.",

      "After\u00a0ruling the Thanksgiving box office\u00a0for years with titles from Pixar and Disney Animation, it\u2019s failed to live up to expectations with its recent string of releases.",
      "In 2016, \u201cMoana\u201d opened over the Thanksgiving holiday, generating $82.1 million. The following year \u201cCoco\u201d took in $72.9 million during its opening, and in 2018 \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d tallied $84.8 million during its debut over the five-day period. Just before the pandemic in 2019, \u201cFrozen II\u201d added $125 million over the Thanksgiving holiday after opening the week before to more than $130 million.",
      "Meanwhile, \u201cEncanto,\u201d which arrived during the midst of the pandemic, managed to tally $40.6 million in 2021. \u201cStrange World\u201d flopped, having scooped up just $18.9 million during the holiday period in 2022, and \u201cWish\u201d snared a meager $31.6 million in 2023. No Disney animated film was released over Thanksgiving in 2020.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d should outperform these post-pandemic releases, however. It arrives in theaters a year after the first film was named the top-streamed film aimed at kids and families. And audiences came out in droves for Disney and Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u2033 over the summer. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened to $154.2 million domestically and tallied more than $1 billion globally during its full run.",

      "However, he went on to explain how the estrangement of his biological father was still difficult for him as a child. \u201cAt the same time, when you don\u2019t have your biological dad around, it\u2019s hard to replace that no matter what. There was always something \u2014\u00a0not missing, but there was always sort of that other side,\u201d he said.",

But it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we didn\u2019t know our dad,\u201d Kate Hudson said.",
      "\u201cI think that estrangement is unfortunately quite common,\u201d Hudson continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to talk about that. If they can\u2019t reconnect or if it\u2019s too challenging, that it\u2019s OK, right?\u201d",
      "Kate Hudson, who eventually reconnected with her biological father, told Willie Geist about her own journey.",
      "\u201cI think as I\u2019ve sort of gone through that process ... I kind of look at my dad and I\u2019m, like, \u2018You know, the love has never ever gone anywhere. It\u2019s always been there, no matter what those complications have been. And healing is ... personal, and I think people sometimes just need to hear that they\u2019re not alone in that.\u201d"

Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",

      "\u201cHer care team is sharing this very personal update with her cherished fans, friends, and supporters to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health,\u201d the statement explained.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, many individuals diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia face stigma and misunderstanding, particularly when they begin to exhibit behavioral changes but have not yet received a diagnosis.\u201d",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appears to have cognitive difficulty when she speaks to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggest at points that these issues are associated with her alcohol use.",
      "Williams currently has a court-appointed legal guardian who oversees her money and her health to avoid the potential for her to be exploited due to her cognitive issues, People reported.",
      "Williams\u2019 sister, Wanda Finnie, also told People in a story published in February 2024, that the star was in a wellness facility that specialized in treating cognitive issues.",
      "\"She\u2019s being treated for some of her mental deficiencies, some of the cognitive issues,\" Williams' niece, Alex Finnie, said in the documentary. \"They\u2019re getting to the root of the problem in terms of what causes maybe some of the drinking and other irrational decisions.\"",
      "Williams revealed she was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease in 2018",
      "In February 2018, the talk show host announced she\u2019d be taking a three-week break from \"The Wendy Williams Show\" because she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease. About a week before, she'd canceled several shows due to experiencing flu-like symptoms. At the time, a rep for her show told TODAY.com in a statement that she'd had Graves' disease for \"many years.\"",

This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans had pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",
      "Williams returned to her show, but she had to take time off in 2019 and again in 2020 to cope with her illness.",
      "\u201cIf hyperthyroidism is untreated, it can be life-threatening,\u201d Adimoolam says. While there are treatments, such as medication, surgery and therapy, Graves\u2019 disease looks different for every person, she adds. Even with treatment, it might remain debilitating for some.",
      "Williams fainted on live TV in 2017",
      "In October 2017, Williams passed out during the Halloween episode of her talk show, kicking off the rumors about her health.",
      "Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she was talking to the camera and then started to shake and struggle to speak before falling on the ground. The show cut to a commercial, and when it returned, she told viewers, \"That was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I passed out.\"",

      "Williams has struggled with alcohol and cocaine use",
      "In 2013, Williams told NPR she used to be a \u201creal fiend\u201d when it came to drugs. \u201cI was addicted to cocaine,\u201d she said. \u201cCrack cocaine \u2014 cooking it, getting it up in the Bronx. ... Thank God I never got stopped by the cops to shame my family and myself and lose my job.\"",
      "In 2019, Williams revealed she was living in a sober house. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve had a struggle with cocaine in my past, and I never went to a place to get the treatment,\" Williams said during an episode of her show.",
      "The documentary and a February 2024 People cover story also reference her alcohol use. The documentary's executive producer Mark Ford told People: \u201cShe was already battling so much physically, and then it became clear that there were mental and addiction issues she was also battling.\"",
      "Throughout the documentary, multiple family members and Selby share their efforts to prevent Williams from drinking. Empty glasses and alcohol bottles are often shown around her apartment. In the final episode, Hunter also says that his mother was diagnosed with \u201calcohol-induced dementia.\u201d",
      "She fractured her shoulder in 2018",
      "In 2019, Variety reported that Williams fractured her shoulder in December of 2018, delaying her return to the show following the holidays. Williams was originally scheduled to return to the show on Jan. 7 but had to delay her return by a week to focus on recovery.",
      "She has lymphedema, especially in her feet",
      "In the documentary, Williams' lymphedema in her feet takes center stage at certain points. In one scene, she cries out and says she can't stand anymore. In another, she refuses to do exercises with a personal trainer to improve her stability out of fear of falling down.",
      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams' case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn't drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person's lifetime. It's not curable, and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "\u201cThis is lymphedema,\u201d Williams says in the documentary as the camera shows her swollen feet. \u201cAnd I can only feel now 2% (of my feet). Do you see what this looks like?\u201d",
      "She first revealed her diagnosis in 2019 on her talk show. She gave a closer look at her condition during a 2022 segment with TMZ Live,",

      "\u201cI spoke with her yesterday, and I speak with her very regularly when she reaches out to me. She is, from what I understand, in a wellness, healing type of environment,\u201d Wanda Finnie said.",
      "\"She is in a healing place emotionally,\" she added. \"She\u2019s not the person that you see in (the documentary).\u201d"

      "Nalo returns in the mid-credits scene. Previously seen only as a thunderous cloud, this time he's in human form with purple eyes and a lightening aura. He sits in his throne room, frustrated over Moana and Maui breaking his curse. He summons his servant Matangi (Awhimai Fraser), then confronts her about not stopping Moana. Unbeknownst to Nalo, Matangi had helped Moana find Motufetu.",

      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",

      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:43:31 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Wicked's\" director and costume designer say why Dorothy's ruby red slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" are silver in \"Wicked.\"",
    "story": [
      "The ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d became nearly as iconic as the film itself. So why were the slippers silver in \u201cWicked\u201d?",
      "Some sharp-eyed fans noticed the change in the film adaptation of the Broadway show starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "And as it turns out, the choice to include the silver slippers was actually staying true to the original source text: In L. Frank Baum\u2019s book \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d the magic slippers were, in fact, silver.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ruby,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d costume designer Paul Tazewell said in an interview with People. \u201cIn the book, they were these odd little silver boots.\u201d",
      "Tazewell explained he took what happened in Maguire\u2019s novel as a starting point for his creation that ended up in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked\u201d the book, Nessarose is described as wearing iridescent shoes that seem to \u201cpulse with hundreds of reflections and refractions.\u201d Glinda later enchants the shoes to help Nessarose walk (though in the Broadway play, Elphaba is the one to cast the spell).",
      "Marissa Bode, who plays Nessarose in \u201cWicked,\u201d ultimately wears silver heels with swirls and sparkles in the film, paying homage to the original while also wearing something unique to the film, Tazewell said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of Cinderella and the glass slipper, and then it\u2019s like how we make shoes a myth and how we\u2019ve indulged them into our fantasy fairytale storytelling,\u201d he said.",
      "In the 1939 film, the move from silver to sparkly red was a stylistic change made to emphasize the contrast between the yellow brick road and Dorothy\u2019s gorgeous heels.",
      "\u201cFor the Technicolor movie, costumers created ruby red shoes to show up more vividly against the yellow-brick road,\u201d reads the Smithsonian description of a pair of the ruby slippers used in the film and now housed in the museum in Washington, D.C. Garland wore several pairs when making \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d; another of them is currently up for auction.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu also weighed in on the change in an interview with Variety, when he was asked if it was true that MGM, which produced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d had the copyright for both the ruby slippers and the yellow brick road. (TODAY has not independently confirmed MGM\u2019s copyrights.)",
      "\u201cWe had boundaries of what we could reference or not. We never use the ruby slippers,\u201d Chu explained. \u201cNessa has on crystal slippers as in the Frank L. Baum book, Gregory Maguire book and the show.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t think the phrase \u2018yellow brick road\u2019 is copywritten, but definitely the shape of the road is. We couldn\u2019t do the spiral. We had to do a circle that continues to show it\u2019s not where the road ends.\u201d",
      "Some eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed an Easter egg paying homage to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when Glinda, played by Grande, briefly grabs a pair of sparkly red slippers while she\u2019s performing \u201cPopular\u201d in the film.",
      "She gifts the shoes to Elphaba, portrayed by Erivo, promising her she\u2019ll do everything she can to help make the future Wicked Witch of the West the most well-liked girl at Shiz.",
      "It turns out the creators of \u201cWicked\u201d have had the power to change the color of the iconic slippers all along, my dear."

I mean, I have a manager now, and at some point I\u2019ll probably have to take a leave of absence for a while, and then assess and see if I would stay or start singing, but for the most part, other than singing out, I\u2019m still the same person, same guy, not changed.\u201d",
      "Goodall, who\u2019s worked as a school janitor for 23 years, says everyone in his school views him as just another person in the halls.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say fame \u2014 but the fame is kind of wearing off, because they see me Monday through Friday,\u201d he says.",

      "The road to victory, however, was a long time coming. Goodall initially tried out for the show in 2009, but he didn\u2019t make the cut. He eventually tried out again, thanks to encouragement from his wife, Angela, whom he married several days prior to the Sept. 24 season finale.",
      "\u201cNot to coin the phrase from the show, but I didn\u2019t stop believing. I kept on singing. I kept on pushing,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cAGT\u201d flew him out to Los Angeles and put him up in a hotel. He was alone as his journey on the show \u2014 and to stardom \u2014 began. He kept to a budget using a supermarket club card to stock up on lunch meat and cottage cheese, which he kept in the mini-refrigerator in his room. He was anxious, but his nerves would melt away when his time to shine came.",
      "\u201cI was nervous as heck. You could just tell it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing is, when the music starts, I\u2019m good to go. That\u2019s where my home is. And so, in the following rounds, I had Ange with me, and it was a little bit better, and was a little bit easier. And each round it got a little bit easier, because I was a little more confident.\u201d",
      "While Goodall is back to work, his singing career is about to take off. He\u2019s performed the national anthem at multiple sporting events and will open for \u201cAGT\u201d judge Howie Mandel at a show in December. He says \u201cregular concerts\u201d will begin in January, noting that \u201cthings are starting to open up.\u201d There are no plans to record an album right now, but he says he \u201cwould love to.\u201d",

      "\"Thankfully I don't get a lot of people reaching out for Taylor Swift tickets,\" Kelce said. \"It is an immediate no, as much as Taylor has said she will take care of anybody that I ask for.\"",
      "Swift, who is dating Kelce's brother, Kansas City Chiefs superstar tight end Travis Kelce, has no qualms honoring the request, according to Kelce. But he's not going there.",
      "\"She\u2019s great, but I still say no to everybody,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to impose on that. I don\u2019t want to put that position out there. She\u2019s been nothing but lovely to our family, she\u2019s a wonderful person, and I don\u2019t want that to kind of be a dynamic.\u201d",

      "Kelce, who is expecting his fourth daughter with wife Kylie, also described the last two years as \"a very whirlwind of events\" between playing his brother's team in the Super Bowl, becoming a television analyst, starting a hit podcast with Travis and finding himself in a much bigger spotlight once Travis started dating Swift."

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:22:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16, in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16, in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal party, passed the Australian House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in the Department of Media and Communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the United States, which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions on it during the one-day period and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it. Yet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report.",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, on Tuesday had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "An Australian Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after verifying the age of users.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say that social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The Australian government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of their daily lives, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at the Queensland University of Technology, said the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and lacked critical details on how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media cited by the government are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus told NBC News in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also noted that the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",
      "\u201cThese features are likely to end up resulting in the very downsides we are trying to avoid for our children: preoccupation with devices, less sleep, less nature, less sport, less real-life friendships, less concentration, exposure to sexualized content,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"

      "President Joe Biden said the ceasefire, which he announced Tuesday, is intended to be permanent, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that he will not hesitate to attack Hezbollah again if it rearms or strikes Israel again.",
      "The sounds of warplanes, missiles and artillery were replaced with dancing and singing in parts of Lebanon as news of the ceasefire was announced late Tuesday.",
      "Despite the nascent truce, it is not clear when people in Lebanon and Israel will be able to return home.",
      "\u201cWe are happy because we will return to our country and homeland in the south,\u201d Hala Saeed, a Lebanese woman displaced from her home, told The Associated Press.",
      "However, even amid the jubilant scenes of flag waving and music outside her shelter in the Lebanese city of Sidon, there was more than a hint of sadness and caution.",
      "\u201cOur joy is very great,\u201d Kamal al-Haj Ali, another displaced resident, told the AP. \u201cOf course we cannot forget the sadness of our martyrs, the people of our villages, the blood is still on the ground.\u201d",
      "While the war in Gaza has received the most international attention, the conflict in Lebanon has spawned a parallel humanitarian crisis, with 3,500 people killed and 1.2 million displaced in Lebanon. In northern Israel, 60,000 people have been forced from their homes, with 80 soldiers and 50 civilians killed, according to local officials.",
      "The ceasefire, brokered by Washington as well as France, effectively reinstates an old agreement that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon but was never fully implemented.",
      "Under United Nations Resolution 1701, Israeli forces are set to leave southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah will withdraw to north of the country\u2019s Litani River, around 18 miles from the border with Israel. They will be replaced by 5,000 troops from the Lebanese army, which is not officially a party to the conflict.",
      "Netanyahu said the ceasefire was an opportunity to focus on Iran \u2014 without elaborating what that meant for Israel's archenemy \u2014 as well as regrouping his own forces after they seriously weakened Hezbollah's command structure and missile arsenal.",
      "But he cautioned that Israel would \u201crespond forcefully\u201d if the terms of the ceasefire were violated.",
      "He did not say when those displaced by the fighting might be able to return to their homes in northern Israel.",
      "Many felt they had little choice to move after Hezbollah began to fire on Israel, destroying homes and buildings and turning once thriving communities into ghost towns. It is unclear when residents, placed into hotels and other temporary accommodation, will able to return.",
      "For Lebanon, the agreement presents the opportunity for respite after more than a year of violence, which as well as the death and displacement has also devastated public services and infrastructure.",
      "Of the 207 health care centers in Lebanon's conflict zone more than 100 have been forced to close, according to the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency (UNHCR).",
      "The crisis has also spilled into neighboring Syria, with 280,000 Syrians who had fled their own war into Lebanon now going back across the border, \u201conce again on the run for their lives,\u201d the UNHCR said in a briefing last month.",
      "Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon's parliament, nonetheless urged people on Wednesday \"to return to your hometowns, as they represent the nation\u2019s collective identity and voice.\u201d",
      "Heeding her advice, some loaded up cars with their belongings and started to head home.",
      "The Israeli military, which has not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, said the opposite.",
      "Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israel Defense Forces Arab media spokesman, gave an \u201curgent warning to the residents of southern Lebanon\u201d in a post on social media.",
      "\u201cYou are prohibited from moving towards the villages that the IDF has asked to be evacuated or towards the IDF forces in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cFor your safety and the safety of your family members, refrain from moving to the area. We will inform you when it is safe to return to your homes.\u201d",
      "This point of contention has already threatened the fragile peace. The IDF said it fired shots at vehicles driving toward \u201ca zone prohibited for movement\u201d in Lebanon. The \u201csuspects,\u201d as the IDF called them, turned around, although it was not clear whether anyone was injured.",
      "The agreement has nonetheless been widely welcomed, from the European Union to Middle East powers such as Egypt and Turkey. The Palestinian militant group Hamas also praised the deal, saying in a statement Wednesday that it had \u201cshattered Netanyahu\u2019s illusions\u201d of \u201cdefeating the resistance forces or disarming them.\u201d",
      "The truce says nothing of the ongoing violence in Gaza, however, where more than 44,000 people, most of them women and children, have been killed in Israel\u2019s military assault against Hamas, according to local health officials.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan told MSNBC Wednesday that the administration would be trying another push at a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, after a year of similar failed attempts.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden intends to begin that work today by having his envoys engage with Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, and other actors in the region,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel launched that offensive after the Hamas militants launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and some 250 kidnapped. The next day, Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel, which returned fire in an exchange that has continued ever since.",
      "Inside Israel, people were divided on the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Some 37% of people are in favor of the terms, 32% oppose them and 31% don\u2019t know, according to a snap poll Tuesday by the Channel 12 television station. Backing was even lower among supporters of  Netanyahu's coalition: 20% support, 45% oppose, 35% don\u2019t know.",
      "Ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was the sole member of Israel\u2019s war Cabinet to oppose the deal. He posted to X late Tuesday that the agreement was a \u201cserious mistake,\u201d saying that it would not help Israelis return to their homes in the north of the country and would not deter Hezbollah.",
      "He said that it \u201cin fact will miss a historic opportunity to strike them hard and bring them to their knees.\u201d"

      "The 80-strong choir has come together to do more than sing, though \u2014 the crew of architects, stonemasons, archaeologists, art historians, art conservators and others have helped rebuild Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral after a fire ripped through the iconic French Gothic masterpiece nearly five years ago.",
      "With hundreds of people working to rebuild a structure so intimately tied to French art, history and culture, it felt natural to start a choir, said Stephanie Duch\u00eane, a conservation scientist and chemical engineer who helped form the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir, or Notre Dame Companions, nearly two years ago.",
      "Much like the building and rebuilding of a cathedral, a small army of individuals needs to work in unison to create extraordinary music.",
      "\u201cEveryone has to do his part to make the music sound good,\u201d said Duch\u00eane, the chief archaeologist and conservation scientist for the Laboratory of Research for Historical Monuments.",
      "Five years after the blaze that destroyed much of the cathedral\u2019s roof and brought down its iconic spire, long one of the city skyline\u2019s most recognizable sights, the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir is preparing to perform in the building they helped save. It will be part of a weekslong celebration marking the long-awaited reopening.",
      "On Dec. 11, the choir will perform a rendition of French composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCantique de Jean Racine,\u201d or \u201cChant by Jean Racine.\u201d",
      "Like many others, Duch\u00eane remembers exactly where she was when she heard about the blaze.",
      "\u201cMy brother sent me a picture of the fire,\u201d Duch\u00eane, 46, told NBC News ahead of rehearsal in the Saint-S\u00e9verin Church, which is known for its musical performances and is the oldest church in Paris\u2019 Left Bank. Just weeks before, she and her husband had taken their children to visit the cathedral \u2014 and now it was at risk of being reduced to rubble and ashes, she remembers.",
      "\u201cEveryone was very sad and very anxious about the potential collapse of the cathedral overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very relieved in the morning when we saw that it was \u2014 that she was \u2014 still standing.\u201d",
      "Agnes Poirier, a French author who published the book \u200b\u200b\u201dNotre-Dame: The Soul of France,\u201d in the aftermath of the fire, echoes the pervasive feeling that the cathedral is much more than simply a building."

    "story": [
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan \u2014 Ambitious climate action often requires ambitious financing \u2014 be it a clean energy transition project or helping developing countries mitigate the effects of natural disasters.",
      "But as extreme weather becomes more the norm and temperatures rise across the planet, what is supposed to be a critical year for funding mitigation efforts has instead turned out to be an especially frustrating one.",
      "Nearly 50,000 people from 200 countries \u2014 including, for the first time, the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan \u2014 were in Azerbaijan for this year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference, with the goal of reaching a critical deal on climate finance. The conference was set to end\u00a0Friday but negotiations over funding extended into the weekend.",
      "A draft of a deal to help the world adapt to and deal with climate change released at the conference, known as COP29, pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. While rich nations say it\u2019s realistic and about the limit of what they can do, it is less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather.",
      "The conference was already shadowed by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement climate change treaty the first time he was president and has vowed to do so again. The atmosphere had also been dampened by poor attendance by world leaders, particularly from wealthy nations.",
      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",
      "Who foots the bill?",
      "Nations that are highly affected by climate change despite being relatively small emitters themselves have grown frustrated with major polluting countries they see as shirking responsibility for helping them cover the costs and trying to hold back their development in the name of environmental protection.",
      "The host of the conference, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, struck a tone of defiance in his keynote address, saying countries like his should not be castigated for exporting fossil fuels, especially by the U.S. and other wealthy nations that continue to rely on them.",
      "Aliyev and others whose countries have developed more recently, many of which were colonized by the West, say they should not be punished economically for the past emissions of wealthier nations.",
      "\u201cWho created this pollution that we have? It\u2019s 120 years of industrial revolution,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s climate envoy, Adel Al-Jubeir, said.",
      "Lord Adair Turner of Britain, who chairs a global coalition known as the Energy Transitions Commission, said the Saudi climate envoy was living in a \u201cdiplomatic fantasy land.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Saudi Arabia to say \u2014 with its level of per capita income \u2014 that it\u2019s a developing country is an insult to true developing countries like in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are going to have to have financial flows not just from rich developed countries in the classic sense in the G7, but also from the rich countries of the Middle East and indeed also from China.\u201d",
      "Though China industrialized later than many of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, analysts from the U.K.-based Carbon Brief said during the conference that China had surpassed the European Union as the world\u2019s second-biggest historical emitter after the United States.",
      "The infighting has only further exasperated Pacific Island nations such as Papua New Guinea, whose Prime Minister James Marape said in August that it would boycott the Baku conference as \u201ca protest at the big nations\u201d that continue emitting while balking at paying.",
      "Marape did eventually send a delegation under pressure from activists.",
      "Even as many world leaders skipped the conference or tried to, it also had first-time attendees from Taliban-led Afghanistan. Though the Taliban have struggled to gain international recognition over their rollback of women\u2019s rights and other abuses, Afghanistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "The agriculture-reliant country has been pushed into a \u201cperil position,\u201d said Asadullah Jawid, an assistant professor at the American University of Afghanistan who has studied the effects of climate change on the country\u2019s farmers.",
      "\u201cDecades of war and instability, economic challenges, devastated infrastructure and an impoverished workforce have left Afghanistan with few resources for climate adaptation initiatives,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Chess' future looms over the world championship, once again missing its biggest star",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:07:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions got underway Monday morning, with reigning champion Ding Liren taking game 1 of the World Chess Championship against 18-year-old phenom Gukesh Dommaraju.",
      "While the world championship is still considered chess' marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the $2.5 million showdown between Liren, a soft-spoken assassin from China, and Gukesh, an up-and-coming prodigy from India, should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

Swidan, a Texas businessman in his 40s, had been detained since 2012 and was sentenced to death with a reprieve in 2019 after being convicted on drug-related charges that a United Nations working group said had no evidential basis.",
      "Li and Swidan were considered \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d by the State Department.",
      "John Leung, an American in his 70s who also has permanent residency in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, was sentenced to life in prison last year after being found guilty of espionage by a court in eastern China. Leung, who was detained in 2021, had been a member of a pro-Beijing group in the United States and had been pictured with senior Chinese officials, according to Hong Kong and Chinese news outlets.",

      "The news was first reported by Politico.",
      "The announcement on Wednesday follows the\u00a0surprise release in September\u00a0of American pastor David Lin, who like Li and Swidan had been classified by the State Department as wrongfully detained. He had been jailed in China since 2006 after being sentenced to life in prison on charges of contract fraud.",
      "The Dui Hua Foundation, which monitors prisoner rights in China, estimates there are about 200 American detainees, more than in any other foreign country, including Americans who are imprisoned as well as those who are prevented from leaving the country while a case is under investigation.",
      "With the return of Li and Swidan, all Americans officially designated as wrongfully detained in China have been released, the State Department spokesperson said.",

      "\u201cThanks to the persistent efforts of the Chinese government, three Chinese citizens who were wrongly detained by the U.S. have safely returned to China,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing. \u201cThis once again proves that China will never give up on its own people.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office next year, U.S.-China relations are poised to be one of the greatest foreign policy challenges for the new administration.",
      "In recent years, the relationship between the world\u2019s two dominant superpowers has been fraught, with lawmakers across the political spectrum adopting a tougher stance on Beijing. What direction that relationship takes now, experts say, will depend on the extent to which Trump follows through on his vow to slap China with steep tariffs \u2014 as well as how strongly he is influenced by advisers who think the U.S. should confront China on far more than trade.",
      "Tariffs 2.0",
      "Trump already rattled global markets this week by saying he would begin his term in office with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, in addition to higher tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. During the campaign, he floated imposing tariffs of at least 60% on China, which some economists have warned could lead to higher prices for American consumers.",
      "Steep tariffs could \u201cundoubtedly terrify investors and have a massive impact on the stock market,\u201d said Josh Kurlantzick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "Tariffs may also set off another \u201ctrade war\u201d with China, mirroring Trump\u2019s first term when Washington and Beijing imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on each other, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhat would happen is, the U.S. would put on tariffs, and then China would put on tariffs in a bunch of places really important to Republican constituencies,\u201d Kurlantzick said.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said his nominee for U.S. trade representative was Jamieson Greer, who helped implement China tariffs during Trump\u2019s first term as chief of staff to Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative at the time.",
      "Analysts warned that the consequences of tariffs could go beyond the economy, potentially affecting national security and health issues.",
      "Steep tariffs could make Beijing wary about cooperating with the U.S. on joint issues, such as cracking down on precursor chemicals for fentanyl, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
      "\u201cIf the Chinese are suffering 60% tariffs across the board, the likelihood of their wanting to cooperate in other realms of the relationship goes down dramatically,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said.",
      "Responding to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Monday, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that \u201cno one will win a trade war.\u201d",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden this month that he was ready to work with the incoming Trump administration and that he hopes for a stable and constructive relationship. But in a seeming message to Trump, he emphasized China\u2019s four \u201cred lines\u201d in its U.S. relations: Taiwan, the promotion of democracy and human rights, efforts to undermine the ruling Chinese Communist Party, and constraining China\u2019s development.",
      "Asked for comment on the future of U.S.-China relations, Liu pointed to comments this month by Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., who said China \u201chas no plan to overtake or displace the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will also have no intention to contain or suppress China,\u201d Xie said, according to the embassy\u2019s transcript.",
      "The first six months of next year will be crucial for setting the tone in U.S.-China relations, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. He said Trump and Xi should try to meet as soon as possible, citing what Trump describes as his strong relationship with the Chinese leader.",
      "Trump is not dealing with the same China as when he left office four years ago. Though Xi, who began a historic third term in office last year, has further consolidated power, his focus will be on addressing an economic slowdown that would only get worse with international instability.",
      "At the same time, however, China has also made significant technological advances in key sectors such as electric vehicles and has diversified its trading relationships to become less reliant on the U.S., its top export market.",
      "Chinese officials seem prepared to work with the Trump administration to \u201cfind an off-ramp before things go sour,\u201d Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, told NBC News in an interview last week during a visit to the Chinese capital, Beijing.",
      "But if Trump does impose extremely high tariffs or take other measures, Beijing could \u201cmake things challenging for the U.S. as well,\u201d he said.",
      "That could mean retaliatory tariffs on agricultural and other U.S. products, investigations into American companies operating in China, restrictions on rare earths and other critical Chinese exports, or weakening the yuan to undermine U.S. trade.",
      "Incoming White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was elected \"to stand up to China, enforce tariffs on Chinese goods, and Make America Strong Again. He will deliver.\"",
      "A hawkish Trump team",
      "It\u2019s unclear just how much Trump will be influenced by his advisers. Many of his picks so far are staunch critics of China, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state; Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security adviser; and Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense.",
      "Rubio, who championed legislation authorizing sanctions on officials accused of rights abuses in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong and the Chinese region of Xinjiang, is himself sanctioned by the Chinese government, which would be a first for a secretary of state if he is confirmed.",
      "His selection by Trump \u201chas instilled some confidence in pro-democracy communities in China and the diaspora, as Rubio is known for his strong objections to Beijing\u2019s human rights abuses,\u201d Yaqiu Wang, the research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at\u00a0Freedom\u00a0House, a Washington think tank, wrote in The Diplomat on Tuesday.",
      "Waltz, who does not need to be confirmed by the Senate, had called on the U.S. to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing human rights abuses, while Hegseth, a Fox News host, has said China aspires to global domination.",
      "Rubio and Waltz \u201chave a very realistic and sober notion of the challenges ahead with respect to China, and on that front, I think they\u2019ll serve President Trump very well,\u201d said Dan Blumenthal, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "But Trump and his aides also have major differences in their approach to China, including whether to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok, which Trump supported before reversing his position this year.",
      "They also may diverge on Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy that Beijing claims as its territory. Trump has unnerved Taiwanese officials by saying the island doesn\u2019t pay enough for its defense and accusing it of \u201cstealing\u201d business from the U.S. with its semiconductor industry.",
      "Experts say Trump may be more transactional in how he deals with China and Taiwan than his advisers, whose approach tends to be more ideological.",
      "Trump \u201cstill wants to get concessions from China, he wants to get benefits from China,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut for those people, they just want to promote decoupling. They just want to contain China and defeat China, and even to provoke conflict with China.\u201d",
      "Chinese officials looking for friendlier intermediaries may turn to others in Trump\u2019s orbit such as Tesla owner Elon Musk, who has extensive business interests in China and often meets with senior Chinese leaders.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope here that he can be a bridge and help keep things calm,\u201d Kennedy said, though \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is more wishful thinking than clear analysis.\u201d",

      "China\u2019s foreign ministry said the communications channels with Sweden and other relevant parties were \u201cunobstructed,\u201d when asked about Sweden\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cI would like to reiterate China\u2019s consistent support working with all countries to maintain the security of international submarine cables and other infrastructure in accordance with international law,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a regular news briefing on Wednesday.",
      "Western intelligence officials from multiple countries have said they are confident the Chinese ship caused the cuts to both cables. But they have expressed different views on whether these were accidents or could have been deliberate.",
      "U.S. Naval Intelligence assesses that both incidents were an accident, according to a U.S. official, but officials from other countries have said sabotage cannot be ruled out.",
      "Katja Bego, Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House, told Reuters that, while between 150-200 such breaches occur every year and the overwhelming majority are accidents, geopolitical tensions in the region meant an investigation was probably warranted.",
      "\u201cInvestigating incidents like this can take a long time, and even if the culprit is found, as appears to be the case here, proving intent is incredibly difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither sabotage nor an accident can be ruled out at this point.\u201d",
      "Russia last week said suggestions it had anything to do with the breaches were \u201cabsurd\u201d.",
      "Kristersson said he was hopeful that China would respond positively to the request to move the ship to Swedish waters. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday that Beijing has maintained \u201csmooth communication\u201d with all parties involved.",
      "Last year a subsea gas pipeline and several telecoms cables running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea were severely damaged, and Finnish police have said they believe the incident was caused by a Chinese ship dragging its anchor.",
      "But the investigators have not said whether they believe the damage in 2023 was accidental or intentional."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Eight employees of a backpacker hostel in Laos have been detained for questioning by local authorities investigating the deaths of six foreign tourists from suspected methanol poisoning, local media reported.",
      "Two Australian teenagers, two Danish women, an American man and a British woman have been confirmed dead by their governments. They are thought to have died after drinking alcohol tainted with methanol, leading foreign governments to warn travelers to be cautious about what they drink at nightclubs and bars in the Southeast Asian nation, particularly if it is free.",
      "Several of those who died had stayed at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng, a town north of the capital, Vientiane, that is popular among backpackers. Guests at the hostel had reportedly been offered free shots of alcohol.",
      "The employees, all Vietnamese nationals between the ages of 23 and 44, were arrested\u00a0on Monday, according to the state-affiliated Laotian Times.",
      "The hostel\u2019s manager, Duong Duc Toan, told The Associated Press last week that the two Australians, Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both 19, had gone out after receiving the free shots and that no other  guests had reported any issues. He and the owner of the hostel, who is also Vietnamese, were also detained for questioning last week, The AP reported.",
      "The American victim has been identified as James Louis Hutson, 57.",
      "Details of the deaths remain unclear, and authorities say investigations are still underway. State-run media said Friday that the suspected cause of the deaths was \u201cthe consumption of tainted alcoholic beverages.\u201d",
      "Travelers have been known to die from methanol poisoning in the past after consuming alcohol laced with it by unscrupulous bar owners trying to increase volume.",
      "The government of Laos, one of the world\u2019s few openly communist states, has said it is \u201cprofoundly saddened\u201d by the deaths and vowed to prosecute those responsible.",
      "The bodies of Jones and Bowles returned to Australia on Tuesday night, accompanied by their relatives.",

    "summary": "Australia moved closer on Wednesday to banning social media for children under 16 after the lower house of Parliament passed a bill.",
    "story": [
      "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia moved closer on Wednesday to banning social media for children under 16 after the lower house of Parliament passed a bill even as Alphabet\u2019s\u00a0Google and Facebook owner Meta\u00a0pressed the government to delay the legislation.",
      "Marking some of the toughest social media controls in the world, Australia\u2019s House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.",
      "The Senate was expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.",
      "Albanese, who is trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.",
      "The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for systemic breaches.",
      "Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban.",
      "A Senate committee backed the\u00a0bill\u00a0this week, but also inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age.",
      "The committee added that the government must \u201cmeaningfully engage\u201d with youth when framing the law.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d said Sen. Karen Grogan, the chair of the committee.",
      "In submissions to Parliament, Google and Meta said the ban should be\u00a0delayed\u00a0until the age-verification trial finishes, expected in mid-2025. ByteDance\u2019s TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk\u2019s X said the proposed law might hurt children\u2019s human rights.",
      "The ban was first announced during an emotionally charged parliamentary inquiry into social media, which included testimony from parents of children who had self-harmed due to cyberbullying.",
      "It has fueled vigorous debate, with youth advocates arguing it robs children of a voice and parent groups saying under-16s are too young to navigate the digital world.",
      "Teenagers have said the law could\u00a0cut them off\u00a0from their most important social and family connections, arguing a ban is not the solution.",
      "\u201cI understand that using social media a lot is not a good thing and I\u2019m working on it,\u201d said Sydney high school student Enie Lam, 16.",
      "\u201cBut a ban is not going to work,\u201d she said.",
      "Albanese\u2019s party, which does not control the Senate, won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill, but has failed to win over the left-leaning Greens and some far-right lawmakers on civil liberties and privacy grounds.",
      "One conservative lower house member broke from the party and voted against the bill on Wednesday, a rare event in Australian politics, and two conservative senators said they also would vote against it, arguing the law should be delayed until the age-verification trial is complete.",
      "Even the Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent statutory authority, opposed the ban, saying it violated children\u2019s rights to self-expression and to participate in society.",
      "Still, polling shows public support overwhelmingly in favor of the move. A YouGov survey released this week showed 77% of Australians backed the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Australian media, from the publicly owned Australian Broadcasting Corp. to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp., also support the ban. An editorial campaign by News Corp., the country\u2019s biggest newspaper publisher, pushed for the ban under the banner \u201cLet Them Be Kids.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur members feel that this is one of the biggest issues impacting on themselves and their families at the moment,\u201d said Jenny Branch-Allen, president of the Australian Parents Council, an advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBig companies have to start taking responsibility. Let\u2019s try and reduce the incidents we\u2019re hearing involved with social media and young people in Australia.\u201d"
