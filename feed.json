      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I'm Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Steve Guttenberg awoke Thursday morning to a grim reality: The treacherous wildfire that tore through the Pacific Palisades had left his once-lush neighborhood charred and unrecognizable.",
      "With homes smoldered, streets emptied and friends scattered by evacuation orders, Guttenberg counted himself among the fortunate. His property was miraculously spared. But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",
      "\u201cJust this morning, I woke up and I was really conscious of my mental state and my mental health, because the last three days, I've seen so much tragedy,\u201d said Guttenberg, pacing through the ruins of his neighborhood. He said his home has electricity but no running water.",
      "Guttenberg thanked God that his block was safe, but he said about 20 homes were burned \u201cpretty bad\u201d in his 80-home community after wind-whipped fires tore across Los Angeles, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. He said the fires are the worst he's ever seen in his 66-years.",
      "The wildfires have burned the homes of several celebrities including Billy Crystal, Carey Elwes and Paris Hilton.",
      "Guttenberg said he never expected all of this to happen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone dies suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when someone gets hit by a car. You never expect that to happen. That\u2019s how shocking it was.\u201d",
      "During Guttenberg\u2019s stroll, it was an eerie scene with scorched palm trees, homes reduced to ash and rubble, and the daytime skies casted an ominous twilight over the devastation.",
      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",
      "When asked about the timeline for his neighborhood's recovery, Guttenberg thinks it could take anywhere from five to 10 years to rebuild and fully heal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unbelievable to try to rebuild this. Rebuild all the beautiful trees, homes and retail shops and lifestyle. The psychology of it all, it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d"

Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",

He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",

      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX.

      "Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d? That's the best idea.",
      "The 55th season of the acclaimed family program features a star-studded lineup of musicians that would be the envy of any summer festival: SZA, Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Samara Joy.",
      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",

      "The sprawling group  --  including mostly nurses, but also physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates, and nurse midwives  --  is \"resolved\" in its \"demands for fair contracts that will invest more in patient safety, follow the [state's] safe staffing law, decrease physician caseload, and offer regionally competitive wages and benefits to be able to recruit and retain more staff,\" the union said.",
      "",
      "In a phone interview with MedPage Today while out on the strike line, Jennifer Lincoln, MD, an ob/gyn at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center in Portland, noted that \"the support out here has been amazing.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's not just nurses and doctors ... it's community members,\" she said. \"We know that the community has our back because we have their back.\"",
      "",
      "Lincoln pointed to safe staffing and physician input into how they do their jobs  --  all aimed at quality patient care  --  as priorities.",
      "",
      "\"We're not asking to make millions,\" she added, but rather similar wages to other providers in the same area, which is essential for attracting and retaining workers.",
      "",
      "\"It's just asking to be treated with the respect that we deserve,\" she said, and being able to \"continue to have amazing healthcare providers.\"",
      "",
      "Lincoln also addressed the significance of physicians striking for the first time in Oregon's history, noting that \"we have to uphold our oath of taking care of our patients, and first doing no harm.\"",
      "",
      "At the same time, she acknowledged that she and her colleagues were \"hopeful that we wouldn't get here,\" noting that they never left the bargaining table with Providence. (Providence St. Vincent hospitalists won their election to unionize with the Pacific Northwest Hospital Medicine Association in August 2023 and have been bargaining since January 2024, according to the ONA.)",
      "",
      "Indeed, as of Thursday afternoon, the ONA and several of the striking healthcare professionals said during a press conference that there was still time to avert a Friday morning strike. Ultimately, that did not occur, with doctors and nurses still seeking what they say are necessary measures in their bargaining efforts with Providence.",
      "",
      "Strike lines will be maintained at the eight Providence locations from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day, the ONA said.",
      "",
      "\"We'll be out here as long as it takes,\" Lincoln said.",
      "",
      "Thousands of healthcare workers remained on the strike line Friday afternoon.",
      "",
      "\"Doctors, nurses, all of us united at this scale is unprecedented,\" Lincoln said. \"It's us taking our power back so that we can do what's best for the patients. Our voices matter.\"",
      "",
      "As the strike continues, the ONA issued a note to patients on behalf on their healthcare providers: \"If you are sick, please do not delay getting medical care. Patients who need hospital or clinical care immediately should go to receive care.\"",
      "",
      "\"We would prefer to provide your care ourselves, but Providence executives' refusal to continue meeting with caregivers has forced us onto the picket line to advocate for you, our communities, and our colleagues,\" the statement continued. \"Going into a hospital or clinic to get the care you need is not crossing our strike line. We invite you to come join us on the strike line after you've received the care you need.\"",
      "",
      "Ben LeBlanc, MD, chief executive officer at Providence Medical Group Oregon, told MedPage Today that operations were running smoothly Friday morning. \"Nearly 2,000 temporary replacement nurses received intensive Providence orientation over the last several days and they have started their shifts in the hospitals, helping our patients.\"",
      "",
      "\"Obviously, a strike is not good for anyone -- not our caregivers, not our community,\" he added. \"We want this situation resolved. We want to reach fair agreements, finalize these contracts, and we want our nurses and doctors off the picket line and back inside our hospitals and clinics to care for this community.\""

      "\u2014 The flu, caused by influenza viruses that are always changing, leads to fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms tend to hit more quickly than cold symptoms, and can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks.",

      "Seriously. Rigorous and frequent handwashing \u2014 with soap! \u2014 is crucial to reduce the spread of norovirus, colds, flu and COVID-19.",
      "This is especially true after using the bathroom and eating or preparing food, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "Don't speed through it, either. Count to 20, slowly, while you scrub away.",
      "If you don't have access to soap and water, try a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol \u2014 though that isn't enough to wipe out norovirus.",
      "If norovirus has found you, you'll want to immediately clean surfaces that came in contact with contaminated food or bodily fluids. The CDC recommends disinfecting things with a chlorine bleach solution or one of the products listed on this Environmental Protection Agency website.",

      "COVID-19 generally spreads through the air from droplets and particles, and the CDC says the risk of getting the virus from a contaminated surface is low.",
      "Viruses can spread through talking, coughing and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue if you feel a tickle in your throat or your nose. Then, wash your hands. Again.",
      "Also, even if you're not sick, consider masking in crowded areas with an N95 or medical-grade mask to protect yourself from respiratory viruses.",

      "Above all, if you're symptomatic, stay at home to keep from getting others sick.",
      "To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain relievers to lower a fever or help with an achy body. Humidifiers can help with symptoms, too.",
      "There's no medication for norovirus. Instead, you'll need to rehydrate as much as possible with water and other liquids. Seek help if you are dehydrated and notice you have a dry mouth and throat, aren't urinating as much or feel dizzy when you're standing up.",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications during a recent five-year period",
      "As U.S. lawmakers debate issues around health care for transgender youth, it\u2019s been difficult to determine the number of young people receiving gender-affirming medications, leaving room for exaggerated and false claims.",
      "Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications \u2014 puberty blockers or hormones \u2014 during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,\" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.\u201d",
      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",
      "___",
      "This story corrects that the expected cost of the program is $28 billion instead of $28 million and explains that it is through 2029.",

      "In late September, Hurricane Helene damaged a major supplier of intravenous (IV) fluids. In this report, we follow up on what has happened since.",
      "Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented and catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, damaging a Baxter manufacturing site that was a major supplier of IV fluids. Hospitals across the country continue to grapple with the ensuing shortage of critical supplies.",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Tens of thousands protested in Romania\u2019s capital on Sunday against a top court\u2019s decision last month to annul the presidential election after an outsider candidate unexpectedly emerged as the frontrunner.",
      "Many of the demonstrators in Bucharest honked horns and waved Romania\u2019s blue, yellow, and red flags, while others brandished placards bearing slogans such as \u201cDemocracy is not optional\u201d and \u201cWe want free elections.\u201d Many also demanded the resumption of the presidential race from the second round.",
      "The protest comes a month after the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the election just two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. The far-right populist Calin Georgescu shocked many when he won the first round on Nov. 24, after which allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged.",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, said at the protest on Sunday, \u201cWe are protesting against the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that took place on Dec. 6.",
      "\u201cWe are sorry to discover so late that we were living in a lie and that we were led by people who claimed to be democrats, but are not at all,\" Simion, whose party organized the protest on Sunday, told reporters. \u201cWe demand a return to democracy through the resumption of elections, starting with the second round.\u201d",
      "The canceled presidential race last month plunged the European Union and NATO member country into turmoil and followed other controversies including a recount of first-round votes.",
      "New dates have been set to rerun the vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election.",
      "Georgescu has since challenged the court\u2019s decision at a local appeals court and lodged a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "The Constitutional Court\u2019s published decision to annul the elections cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as the use of \u201cundeclared sources\u201d of funding. Georgescu had declared zero campaign spending.",
      "Many observers attributed Georgescu's success to his TikTok account, which now has 7.2 million likes and 646,000 followers. Some experts suspected Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while Romania\u2019s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates.",
      "On Friday, another protest in Bucharest was attended by thousands who also expressed anger over the canceled presidential race.",

      "The French territory of Mayotte is on red alert again with another cyclone heading toward the islands off Africa that were devastated by their worst storm in nearly a century last month",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The French territory of Mayotte was battered by a new tropical storm Sunday, just weeks after the worst cyclone to hit the islands in nearly a century laid waste to entire neighborhoods and villages and forced a huge recovery effort by authorities.",
      "Mayotte's people were ordered to stay indoors or find a solid shelter if they didn't have one, and store food and water, as Tropical Storm Dikeledi brought heavy rains and strong winds to once again pound France's poorest department.",
      "Mayotte, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, had only just begun the process of rebuilding after the devastation of Cyclone Chido last month, which killed at least 39 people, left more than 200 still missing, and injured more than 5,000 when in struck on Dec. 14.",
      "Dikeledi passed over nearby Madagascar as a cyclone on Saturday but had weakened to a tropical storm by the time it reached Mayotte on Sunday, French meteorological service Meteo-France said. The center of the storm would pass about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Mayotte, Meteo said. Chido had hit Mayotte head-on.",
      "Meteo-France warned Dikeledi could strengthen into a cyclone again, while authorities in Mayotte said there was a high danger of flooding and landslides and issued a red alert for the islands on Saturday night. That alert would remain in place for Sunday and civilians were forbidden from being outside until the alert was lifted, said the Mayotte Prefecture, the French government department that runs the territory.",
      "\u201cThe danger to the population persists,\u201d the prefecture said in a series of alerts on its official Facebook page. It said the weather would be calm at one point on Sunday but would become violent again later in the day.",
      "Mayotte was also again opening cyclone shelters at schools and community centers for those in need, the prefecture said. The international airport, which was heavily damaged by Chido, was closed again until further notice, the prefecture said.",
      "Officials said they were taking no chances after the devastation of Chido, which also prompted an angry reaction by Mayotte residents who vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron when he visited days after the disaster. Mayotte's people have previously accused the French government of neglecting them and the territory, which is the poorest in the European Union.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said more than 4,000 emergency personnel and security forces had been mobilized for Dikeledi's arrival, with much of the focus on the precarious shantytowns around the capital, Mamoudzou, and other areas, which were largely destroyed by Chido.",
      "National TV station Mayotte la 1\u00e8re said that the southern village of Mbouini, one of the few in Mayotte spared by Chido, had been flooded and almost totally destroyed by Dikeledi. Mayotte la 1\u00e8re broadcast video of the residents of Mbouini escaping in wooden canoes as their homes were submerged under flood water.",
      "Mayotte is a densely populated territory of around 320,000 people. Another 100,000 undocumented migrants from nearby Comoros and elsewhere are also believed to live on the islands, which are a draw for people from poorer countries because of the French welfare system.",
      "Chido was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years, authorities said. While 39 deaths have been confirmed, French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou warned on a visit to the islands two weeks ago that the final death toll could be several hundred. Authorities have faced challenges in recording the deaths and injuries from Chido because many of those affected were undocumented migrants, and also because of the Muslim practice of burying people within 24 hours of them dying.",
      "After smashing Mayotte, Chido made landfall on mainland Africa, killing more than 100 others in Mozambique and Malawi. Meteorologists expect Dikeledi to turn south and then east, tracking back toward Madagascar and out to sea after passing Mayotte.",
      "November to April is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and the region has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. The worst was Cyclone Idai in 2019, which killed more than 1,500 people in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe and affected more than 3 million people.",

      "Germany is one of several countries that imposed sanctions on the Assad government over its brutal crackdown on dissent. Those penalties could hinder Syria's recovery from nearly 14 years of civil war that killed an estimated 500,000 people and displaced half the prewar population of 23 million.",
      "\u201cSanctions against Assad\u2019s henchmen who committed serious crimes during the civil war must remain in place,\u201d Baerbock said. \u201cBut Germany proposes to take a smart approach to sanctions, providing rapid relief for the Syrian population.

Al-Sharaa was a former senior al-Qaida militant who broke with the group years ago and has pledged an inclusive Syria that respects the rights of religious minorities.",
      "The rebels led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family\u2019s decades-long rule.",
      "Much of the world severed ties with Assad and imposed sanctions on his government \u2014 and its Russian and Iranian allies \u2014 over alleged war crimes and the manufacturing of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across Syria\u2019s porous borders.",

      "HMPV, which belongs to the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus, causes flu or cold-like symptoms including fever, cough and nasal congestion. The symptoms often clear up by themselves, though they can cause lower respiratory tract infections among children, older adults and those immunocompromised.",

      "Wang added that the increase in recent years in the number of cases of the virus, first detected in the Netherlands in 2001, is due to better detection methods.",
      "\u201cAt present, the rate of positive cases in human metapneumovirus detection is fluctuating, and the rate of positive cases in northern provinces is declining, and the rate of positive cases among patients aged 14 and below has started to decline,\u201d she said.",
      "Concerns surfaced in recent days over a surge in HMPV infections in northern China after images circulated online of hospitals overrun with masked patients. The World Health Organization said it has not received reports of unusual outbreaks in China or elsewhere.",
      "Experts say HMPV is unlike COVID-19 in that it has been around for decades and there is some built-in immunity to it. Most children are infected with the virus by the age of 5.",
      "Wang said respiratory diseases currently affecting people in China are caused by known pathogens, and no new infectious diseases have emerged.",
      "The number of patients in fever clinics and emergency departments across the country has been rising but is still generally lower compared to the same period last year, said Gao Xinqiang, deputy director of the Department of Medical Emergency Response of the health commission.",
      "\u201cThere is no obvious shortage of medical resources,\u201d Gao said.",
      "Flu infections across the country are expected to gradually decline in mid-to-late January, said commission spokesperson Hu Qiangqiang.",
      "There are no vaccines or drugs available for HMPV. Experts recommend precautions against catching the virus and other respiratory diseases including washing one\u2019s hands regularly, avoiding crowds if possible, and wearing a mask in crowded places.",

    "story": [
      "Tatu City outside Kenya's capital is a startup city, privately owned and with aspirations of eventually having a population of 250,000",
      "KIAMBU, Kenya -- Turn into Tatu City on the outskirts of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and it feels like entering a different world.",
      "Even the country's most reckless drivers are transformed, slowing to a crawl and not tossing trash out the window \u2014 thanks to surveillance cameras and rigorously enforced penalties for speeding and littering.",
      "For the 5,000 people who have moved into Tatu, a \u201cstartup city\u201d that welcomed its first residents four years ago, the ruthless upholding of such rules makes the place appealing.",
      "\u201cTatu has more law and order than other places,\u201d said Valerie Akoko, a digital content creator who moved in two years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Tatu City dirty.\u201d",
      "Situated on 5,000 acres, Tatu City aspires to be what its name suggests: a city, privately owned, that its designers hope will eventually have a population of 250,000. It is already home to 88 businesses employing 15,000 people. They include CCI Global, which operates a 5,000-seat call center, and Zhende Medical, a Chinese medical supply manufacturer.",
      "There are similar projects around the world. But in sub-Saharan Africa, champions of the idea hope that new-city developments can address the continent\u2019s urbanization conundrum: While the growth of cities has rolled back poverty elsewhere, the region has largely been an exception.",
      "History suggests that as people move into cities, productivity increases, wages rise, exports grow and a country gets richer. But in Africa, urbanization has rarely unleashed such economic transformation.",
      "In theory, Africa should be prospering. The continent\u2019s urban population is set to grow by 900 million by 2050, according to the United Nations, more than the present urban population of Europe and North America combined.",
      "But sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing while still poor.",
      "\u201cTowns and cities in Africa today simply lack the tax base needed to invest in the urban infrastructure needed to accommodate the tsunami of people being added to their ranks in a short period of time,\u201d said Kurtis Lockhart, director of the Africa Urban Lab, a research center at the African School of Economics in Zanzibar.",
      "Weak property rights and political tensions can make the problem worse.",
      "Even Tatu City has battled Kenyan politicians and politically connected businessmen. In 2018, the London Court of International Arbitration ruled in favor of the development\u2019s multinational owner, Rendeavour, in a dispute with its Kenyan former partners, including a former governor of the central bank. The dispute delayed project development by several years.",
      "Last year, Tatu City\u2019s Kenya head, Preston Mendenhall, took the unusual step of accusing the governor of the county where the development is based of extortion, saying he had demanded land worth $33 million in exchange for approving its updated master plan. The governor denied it and is suing Tatu City and Mendenhall for defamation. No ruling has been made.",
      "Still, the case for building new cities, complete with new infrastructure, is compelling to some. The Charter Cities Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit, argues that, done properly, such projects could drive growth, create jobs and \u201clift tens of millions of people out of poverty.\u201d The institute sees Tatu City as a model.",
      "Yet building new cities is hard. Africa is littered with failed projects.",
      "A handful have shown promise. Angola\u2019s Quilamba city, whose construction began in 2002, is arguably the most successful, with a population of more than 130,000. It was built by CITIC, a state-owned Chinese company, but is owned by the Angolan government.",
      "Perhaps a dozen new city projects \u2014 from Zanzibar to Zambia \u2014 are underway in Africa that stand a chance of emulating Quilamba, experts reckon. Of these, Tatu is the farthest along, with 26,400 people already living, working or studying there.",
      "Experts agree that the private sector must play a role in African urbanization, saying African states are too fiscally constrained to fill the investment gap themselves. Rendeavour, a private company with a multibillion-dollar balance sheet, has deep enough pockets to make a difference.",
      "But leaving city-building to the private sector alone can cause problems, for instance by worsening inequality. The average price of a property at Eko Atlantic, a new-city development on the outskirts of Lagos, is $415,000, far beyond the means of most Nigerians.",
      "\u201cStartup cities can serve as hubs for innovation and alleviate pressure on overcrowded urban centers,\u201d said Anacl\u00e1udia Rossbach, executive director of the UN\u2019s Human Settlements Program, or UN-Habitat. \u201cHowever, to be impactful, they must prioritize inclusivity, affordability and integration with existing urban areas, ensuring they serve all socioeconomic groups rather than becoming isolated enclaves for elites.\u201d",
      "A one-bedroom apartment in Tatu City sells for $45,500, still beyond the means of most Kenyans, but within reach of some in the emerging middle class. Kenya\u2019s per capita GDP was $1,961 in 2023, according to the World Bank.",
      "The development collaborates with Kenya's government, which has designated Tatu City a special economic zone. That means companies setting up there are eligible for tax benefits and other incentives, making it a model of private-public partnership, experts say.",
      "Tatu City also appeals to businesses and residents with its transparent governance structure and services that are often lacking elsewhere in Kenya, including its own water supply and energy grid. It falls under national law but can set its own rules on matters like traffic and what kind of houses can be built, with all plans requiring approval from Tatu\u2019s management.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the infrastructure, if you look at the utilities, if you look at the controls, if you look at the security, it is one of the best,\u201d said Sylvester Njuguna, who lives and owns a restaurant there.",
      "Unlike many startup cities built far from urban centers, Tatu City is 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Nairobi, close enough to plug into its labor markets.",
      "According to Lockhart with the Africa Urban Lab, new city projects usually succeed if they are close enough to a major urban center and house both a high-quality anchor tenant \u2014 CCI Global in Tatu City's case \u2014 and good schools. They should operate under effective management and respond to market demand.",
      "Tatu meets these criteria and, unlike many grandiosely conceived African city projects, it has grown organically like Rendeavour\u2019s other city projects in Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and the Congo, according to Mendenhall.",
      "\u201cWe are building what the market needs,\" he said. \"We are not putting all the infrastructure on day one.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Croatia\u2019s President Zoran Milanovi\u0107 is the overwhelming favorite to win reelection against a ruling conservative party candidate in a runoff presidential vote",
      "ZAGREB, Croatia -- Croatia\u2019s incumbent President Zoran Milanovi\u0107 will be the overwhelming favorite to win reelection when he faces a ruling conservative party candidate in a runoff presidential vote on Sunday.",
      "The left-leaning Milanovi\u0107 comfortably won the first round of voting on Dec. 29, leaving his main challenger Dragan Primorac, a forensic scientist who had unsuccessfully run for presidency previously, and six other candidates far behind.",
      "The runoff between the top two contenders was necessary because Milanovi\u0107 won 49% of the vote, falling short of securing outright victory by merely 5,000 votes, while Primorac trailed far behind with 19%.",
      "The election comes as the European Union and NATO member country of 3.8 million people struggles with biting inflation, corruption scandals and a labor shortage.",
      "Milanovi\u0107, 58, is an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He is the most popular politician in Croatia, and is sometimes compared to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents.",
      "Milanovi\u0107 has served as prime minister in the past with a mixed record. He has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 and the pair have long sparred with each other.",
      "Milanovi\u0107 regularly accuses Plenkovi\u0107 and his conservative Croatian Democratic Union party of systemic corruption, calling the premier a \u201cserious threat to Croatia\u2019s democracy.\u201d",
      "Plenkovi\u0107 has sought to portray Sunday's vote as one about Croatia\u2019s future in the EU and NATO. He has labelled Milanovi\u0107 \u201cpro-Russian\u201d and a threat to Croatia\u2019s international standing.",
      "Political analyst Viseslav Raos said the increasingly outspoken Milanovi\u0107 has no motive to \u201ctry to please someone or try to control himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there was no cooperation with the prime minister for the first five years (of his presidency), why would it be now,\u201d he added.",
      "Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme military commander.",
      "Despite limited powers, many believe the presidential position is key for the political balance of power in a country mainly governed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) since gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.",
      "During a TV debate ahead of the Sunday vote, Milanovi\u0107 and Primorac exchanged barbs while exposing deep political differences.",
      "Primorac, 59, entered politics in the early 2000s, when he was science and education minister in the HDZ-led government. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2009, and after that mainly focused on his academic career including lecturing at universities in the United States, China and in Croatia.",
      "Milanovi\u0107 denied he is pro-Russian but last year blocked the dispatch of five Croatian officers to NATO's mission in Germany called Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine. He also pledged he would never approve sending Croatian soldiers as part of any NATO mission to Ukraine. Plenkovic and his government say there is no such proposal.",
      "Milanovi\u0107 accused Primorac of associating with \u201cmass murderers,\u201d referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's associates and the war in Gaza. He also claimed that Plenkovi\u0107 was Primorac\u2019s sponsor, and dubbed Primorac \u201cthe last communist\u201d \u2014 a reference to his membership of the former ruling Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the late 1980s.",
      "Primorac meanwhile claimed that Milanovi\u0107\u2019s only political allies were Bosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik, Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and Hungary\u2019s populist leader Viktor Orban.",

      "\u201cIf you think that threatening and insulting us is going to win us over, you really don\u2019t know a thing about us,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien wrote in the article. \u201cWe may look easy-going, mild-mannered. But make no mistake, we have spine and toughness.\u201d",

      "Canadian officials have been talking to incoming Trump administration officials about increasing border security in an effort to avoid a sweeping 25% tariff that Trump has threatened to impose on all Canadian products.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum."

      "The Prefecture of Mayotte said the red alert warning was issued at 10 p.m. local time in preparation for the arrival of Cyclone Dikeledi, which made landfall in northern Madagascar earlier Saturday and was moving west toward Mayotte.",

      "Mayotte has not yet recovered from the impact of Cyclone Chido, which ripped through the archipelago a month ago, causing extensive damage to France's poorest department.

      "November to April is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and the region has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years.

      "The sighting and capture of the lynx comes as some environmental activists seek to reintroduce lynx as a way to control the burgeoning deer population and highlight Scotland\u2019s commitment to wildlife diversity.",
      "Police are still investigating the incident and have released no information about possible suspects.

      "A delegation from one of Turkey\u2019s biggest pro-Kurdish political parties has met a leading figure of the Kurdish movement in prison, the latest step in a tentative process to end the country\u2019s 40-year conflict",
      "ISTANBUL -- A delegation from one of Turkey's biggest pro-Kurdish political parties met a leading figure of the Kurdish movement in prison Saturday, the latest step in a tentative process to end the country\u2019s 40-year conflict, the party said.",
      "Three senior figures from the Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, met the party\u2019s former co-chairperson, Selahattin Demirtas, at Edirne prison near the Greek border.",
      "The meeting with Demirtas \u2014 jailed in 2016 on terrorism charges that most observers, including the European Court of Human Rights, have labelled politically motivated \u2014 took place two weeks after DEM members met Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned head of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK.",
      "While the PKK has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s, the DEM is the latest party representing left-leaning Kurdish nationalism. Both DEM and its predecessors have faced state measures largely condemned as repression, including the jailing of elected officials and the banned of parties.",
      "In a statement released on social media after the meeting, Demirtas called on all sides to \u201cfocus on a common future where everyone, all of us, will win.\u201d",
      "Demirtas credited Ocalan with raising the chance that the PKK could lay down its arms. Ocalan has been jailed on Imrali island in the Sea of Marmara since 1999 for treason over his leadership of the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and most Western states.",
      "Demirtas led the DEM between 2014 and 2018, when it was known as the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or HDP, and he is still widely admired. He said that despite \u201cgood intentions,\u201d it was necessary for \u201cconcrete steps that inspire confidence \u2026 to be taken quickly.\u201d",
      "One of the DEM delegation, Ahmet Turk, said: \u201cI believe that Turks need Kurds and Kurds need Turks. Our wish is for Turkey to come to a point where it can build democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "The armed conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state, which started in August 1984 and has claimed tens of thousands of lives, has seen several failed attempts at peace.",
      "Despite being imprisoned for a quarter of a century, Ocalan remains central to any chance of success due to his ongoing popularity among many of Turkey's Kurds. In a statement released on Dec. 29, he signaled his willingness to \u201ccontribute positively\u201d to renewed efforts.",
      "Meanwhile, in an address Saturday to ruling party supporters in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the Kurdish-majority southeast, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for the disbandment of the PKK and the surrender of its weapons.",
      "This would allow DEM \u201cthe opportunity to develop itself, strengthening our internal front against the increasing conflicts in our region, in short, closing the half-century-old separatist terror bracket and consigning it to history ... forever,\u201d he said in televised comments.",
      "The latest drive for peace came when Devlet Bahceli, leader of the far-right Nationalist Movement Party and a close ally of Erdogan, surprised everyone in October when he suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if he renounced violence and disbanded the PKK.",
      "Erdogan offered tacit support for Bahceli\u2019s suggestion a week later, and Ocalan said he was ready to work for peace, in a message conveyed by his nephew."

      "Sudanese officials says the military and its allies had taken back the strategic city of Wad Medani more than a year after the Rapid Support Forces seized it",
      "CAIRO -- Sudan\u2019s military and its allies have taken back a strategic city from the rebel Rapid Support Forces, officials said Saturday, dealing a major blow to the notorious paramilitary group which the United States accused of committing genocide in the country\u2019s ongoing civil war.",
      "The recapture of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, came more than a year after it fell to the RSF. Wad Medani had previously been a safe haven for displaced families in the early months of the war.",
      "The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities across the sprawling northeastern African country.",
      "The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine swept parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration said that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and slapped sanctions on the RSF leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, as well as seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan.",
      "The military said in a statement that its forces had entered Wad Medani early Saturday and that they were working to \u201cclear the rebels\u2019 remnants inside the city.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongratulations to the Armed Forces, their supporting forces everywhere and to our people as they reclaim their dignity, security and stability,\u201d the statement said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the RSF.",
      "Culture and Information Minister Kahlid Aleiser, who is the government spokesman, said the military and its allies \u201cliberated\u201d Wad Medani, which is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Khartoum.",
      "Soldiers posted videos on social media purportedly showing forces celebrating with residents in the city center. One video showed residents taking to the streets to celebrate the \u201cliberation\u201d of the city, and shouting, \u201cAllah is Great.\u201d",
      "Since the RSF captured Wad Medani in December 2023, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in and around the city.",
      "In recent months the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capital's sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces.",
      "The war has created the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis, driving over 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million people have crossed into neighboring countries including Chad, Egypt and South Sudan.",
      "Famine has been also detected in at least five areas, including three camps for displaced people in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, according to an international monitoring project, the Integrated Food Security Classification, or IPC. The IPC said five other areas are projected to experience famine in the next six months. More areas are also at risk of famine, it said."

      "ALTADENA, Calif. -- The sight of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie stars.",
      "But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.",
      "Some now fear the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed.",
      "Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just go to my second home and stay there,'\" Santoro said.",
      "The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to believe that you have nothing,\u201d Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. \"Everything that they ever worked for was in that house.\u201d",
      "Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data.",
      "During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate.",
      "That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty.",
      "Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families.",
      "\u201cSomeone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And that is going to change the character of Altadena,\" Knapp said, adding that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt.",
      "The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone.",
      "He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because \u201cyour $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home.\u201d",
      "Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest. \"Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion dollars to help us get back where we were at.\u201d",
      "Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: \u201cI would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African-Americans.\"",
      "She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches.",
      "But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing.",
      "The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them,\u201d he said.",
      "The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear.",
      "She did not have renter's insurance. \u201cObviously now I\u2019m thinking about it. Wish I had it,\u201d she said.",
      "Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and regroup. But she likely won\u2019t be returning to Altadena.",

      "The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are far from contained, but they're already expected to be the costliest in U.S. history and among the worst natural disasters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.",
      "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.",
      "A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.",
      "\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.",
      "AccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.",
      "The insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.",
      "The L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.",
      "\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.",
      "In a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.",
      "While the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.",
      "That's far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.",
      "\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.",
      "It could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The second-guessing began before the bodies had been cleared from the debris of the deadly Bourbon Street truck attack.",
      "A law firm signed up survivors of what it called a \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d tragedy. Politicians parried blame for the latest mass-casualty event in New Orleans\u2019 infamous adult playground. And investigations targeted the ill-fated removal of the street's bollards, steel columns designed to restrict vehicle access.",
      "But as the city seeks to recover and beefs up security ahead of next month's Super Bowl and Carnival season, law enforcement and community leaders are confronting an existential question as old as the entertainment district: Can Bourbon Street be protected in a way that preserves its unique, round-the-clock revelry?",
      "\u201cOnce we start to hear what it\u2019s actually going to take to secure the French Quarter and the Mardi Gras parade routes, I don\u2019t know if this city is going to have an appetite for all that,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission watchdog group.",
      "\u201cIf we try to make New Orleans as secure as an airport, people aren't going to like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Disney World.\u201d",
      "Shock and grief have given way to finger-pointing over whether additional security could have stopped \u2014 or mitigated \u2014 the Islamic State group-inspired attack, which killed 14 people when Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup through a New Year's crowd.",
      "In the difficult days since, proposals for new safety measures have ranged from banning vehicular traffic in the French Quarter to turning the historic neighborhood into a state park.",
      "Many locals who depend on tourism agree that something has to give.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just too wide open. It\u2019s too trustworthy down here,\u201d said Bryan Casey, 53, a native New Orleanian who has worked on Bourbon Street since the late 1990s and waits tables at Galatoire\u2019s, an upscale restaurant that opened in 1905. Casey and his colleagues wiped blood off the wall after the attack as bodies lay mangled in front of the establishment.",
      "Bourbon Street should have been made into a pedestrian mall long ago, Casey said: \u201cThere\u2019s people watching and they\u2019re going to get you, so you got to be careful.\u201d",
      "Much of the immediate focus has centered on the absence of the bollards, which had stopped working reliably and were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl.",
      "City leaders have been criticized for the timing of that project and failing to implement a suitable replacement during their repair. A lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of victims alleged the city \u201chad years of opportunities\u201d to patch up vulnerabilities.",
      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has already failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant as soon as I turn on Bourbon Street.\u201d",

      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean this week accused Russia of artificially creating an energy crisis to cause \u201cinstability in the region\u201d and \u201cto influence the results of the parliamentary elections\u201d that Moldova will hold later in 2025.",
      "\u201cWhat they want to achieve is to have a pro-Russian government in Moldova that would ultimately allow for the consolidation of the military capacity of Russia in the Transnistrian region, and correspondingly to use this leverage over Ukraine,\u201d Recean told journalists in a closed call with other senior officials on Monday.",
      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a sprawling \u201chybrid war\u201d against it by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country\u2019s EU aspirations.",
      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",
      "EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on the social media platform X this week that Russia \u201ccontinues to use gas as a weapon and once again Moldova is a target of its hybrid warfare,\" adding that \u201cThanks to EU support Moldova remains resilient and well-connected to European energy networks.\"",
      "Moldova\u2019s government this week announced plans to connect more than a dozen towns and villages under Chisinau\u2019s control that are interconnected with energy infrastructure in Transnistria to energy networks in Moldova.",

      "\u201cWhere possible, people bought generators, but that\u2019s also not a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a generator, someone needs to start it, a person who understands how to use it. It requires money, staff.\u201d",
      "Cutzari added that institutions in his village including a kindergarten, medical facilities, an ambulance, city hall and a post office would struggle if the gas ran out entirely. \u201cIt would be better if electricity and gas were always available,\u201d he said.",
      "Prime Minister Recean said that since the beginning of the energy crisis, his government in Chisinau has \u201cproposed organizing procurement for purchasing gas on behalf of the Transnistrian side,\" but that authorities in the region\u2019s de facto capital, Tiraspol, have refused.",
      "\u201cTiraspol is not autonomous in the decisions it makes,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cThis crisis is induced by the Russian Federation in order to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and to use the Republic of Moldova in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After visiting Copanca and other villages in a similar bind on Thursday, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said some kindergartens and schools have been provided with power generators, and that mayors can request help from Chisinau to supply firewood, wood-burning pellets, and generators.",

    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",

      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "The report says the U.S. economy outperformed expectations last year thanks to consumer and public-sector spending, but growth is expected to slow from 2.8% to 1.9% this year.",
      "The report points out that China sees its own strong growth slowing slightly from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.8% in 2025 due to lower consumption and property-sector weaknesses that are failing to make up for public investment and export strength. This is forcing the government to enact policies to lift property markets, fight local government debt and boost demand.",
      "China's \u201cshrinking population and rising trade and technology tensions, if unaddressed, could undermine medium-term growth prospects,\u201d the report reads.",

      "Both remain below the 3% rate that the world saw before the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020.",
      "European growth this year is projected to gradually pick up after a weaker than expected performance in 2024. Japan is poised to pick up from periods of near-recession and recession. India is expected to drive a strong outlook for South Asia, with regional growth projected at 5.7% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.",
      "India's 6.6% growth forecast for 2025 is backed by solid private consumption and investment growth, the report says.",
      "\u201cThe global reduction of poverty over the past 30 years has been driven by strong economic performance. This has been especially true in Asia, where rapid economic growth and structural transformation have allowed countries such as China, India, and Indonesia to achieve poverty alleviation unprecedented in scale and scope,\u201d the report says.",
      "\u201cThe world economy has largely avoided a broad-based contraction despite the unprecedented shocks of the last few years and the most prolonged period of monetary tightening in history,\u201d said Li Junhua, director, of the Economic Analysis and Policy Division at the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.",

      "The official said the wide-ranging list hasn't been completed yet. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "Trump said this week he will use economic coercion to pressure Canada to become the nation\u2019s 51st state. And he continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",

      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",

      "\u201cWe don't need their energy. We don't need their oil and gas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don't need anything that they have.\u201d",

      "Two hundred Utah ski patrollers returned to work Thursday after voting to accept a new labor contract and end a nearly two-week strike that closed many trails and caused long lift lines at the ones that remained open during a busy time of year at the country's biggest ski resort.",
      "The Park City Ski Professional Ski Patrol Association claimed victory, saying in a statement that Colorado-based Vail Resorts, which owns Park City Mountain Resort, acceded to its key demands including a $2-an-hour base-pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",
      "\"This contract is more than just a win for our team \u2014 it\u2019s a groundbreaking success in the ski and mountain worker industry. This effort demonstrates what can be achieved when workers stand together and fight for what they deserve,\u201d ski patroller and union lead negotiator Seth Dromgoole said in a statement.",
      "Union negotiators and Vail Resorts announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal. The full union voted Wednesday to accept the agreement.",
      "The strike began Dec. 27 after negotiations that started in March bogged down and the union accused Vail Resorts of bargaining unfairly. The strike coincided with the busy holiday season and a period of more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of fresh but difficult-to-access snowfall at the resort.",
      "Despite the closed trails and long lift lines, some skiers expressed support for the strikers, chanting \u201cPay your employees!\u201d in videos posted on social media.",

We apologize to our guests who were impacted by this strike and are incredibly grateful to our team who worked hard to keep the mountain open and operating safely over the past two weeks,\" Bill Rock, Vail Resorts' mountain division president, said in a statement.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. It said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",

It had been offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",

      "\u201cThe issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling injured skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody is nearby. Many work other jobs in the summer, including as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides.",

      "\u201cWe absolutely need more climate-smart technologies,\u201d said Jacqueline Heard, CEO and co-founder of Enko Chem, which researches climate tech solutions in agriculture \u2014 an industry Heard says is \u201cunder a lot of pressure right now.\u201d",
      "That much is clear on the CES show floor, where farming is on full display and company leaders are highlighting the impacts of climate change and labor shortages on farmers.",
      "Not far from John Deere's booth where autonomous tractors and dump trucks are towering over conference attendees, Kubota, another equipment manufacturing company, is showcasing its AI technology that detects diseases in crops and sprays where pests have been identified.",
      "Todd Stucke, president of Kubota Tractor Corporation, said AI is the future of farming, especially with \u201csummers getting longer and storms getting stronger.\u201d",
      "Stucke himself grew up on a potato farm in Ohio. Each night after dinner, his father would scour the field for bugs and then send Stucke out to spray the crops with insecticides.",
      "\u201cWe sprayed the whole field, but we might've only needed to spray a part of the field or a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that analogy into vineyards, orchards and so forth, you don\u2019t have to spray everything.\u201d",
      "This is known as \u201cprecision agriculture,\u201d Heard said. \u201cIt allows farmers to really optimize their land.\"",
      "The idea, Heard said, is that farmers can expand the lifespan and improve the quality of their crops while using fewer chemicals, like pesticides and fertilizer.",
      "\u201cIt's good for the environment. It's good for farmers,\" she said.",
      "Heard said she wouldn't be surprised if AI can one day help farmers map out their land, showing them the different soil types and what kinds of crops would grow best there.",
      "\u201cIt could be that with climate change, they should move to a crop that's much more adapted to this new world,\" she said.",
      "Back at the John Deere booth, Maichel, a tree nut farmer, said he's hopeful that advancements in AI will help him better manage the unpredictability of farming. Each year on his orchard is different from the last.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sliding scale, per se, that we have to deal with as far as climate change goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really bend to the climate that we\u2019re dealt with. It\u2019s not something I can predict. It\u2019s really something we have to adapt to every growing season.\u201d",
      "If someone had told him just 10 years ago that a tractor would one day be driving itself through his orchard, he said he wouldn't have believed it. But now, he says, he sees how this evolving technology can help him adapt to the changing industry and climate.",
      "\"We all need to eat, right?\" Maichel said. \u201cA farmer\u2019s job is one that we all need.\u201d",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "The late New York Sen_ Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it this way decades ago: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan memorably wrote four decades ago.",
      "That seems like a simpler time \u2014 especially when you consider Meta's decision to end a fact-checking program on social media apps Facebook, Instagram and Threads and what the ramifications might be for an industry built to bring clarity and to seek truth itself.",
      "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this week was widely seen in news verification circles as a genuflection to president-elect Donald Trump, whose first term in office popularized the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d",
      "Meta is replacing its fact-checking with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system reminiscent of X, where it depends on users to correct misinformation on its platforms. In a way, that hearkens back to \u201che said-she said\u201d journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.",
      "The moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network. Her organization started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta's move.",
      "\u201cIn the long term,\" she said, \"I think it\u2019s very uncertain what this will all mean.\u201d",
      "Fact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it's a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter \u201che said-she said\u201d stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organization FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.",
      "PolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.",
      "By 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by Republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, \u201csped up a trend that had already begun.\u201d",
      "Some conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some Republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn\u2019t like being called out for it, said Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of the center-right site The Dispatch.",
      "\u201cThe people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, \u2019We are the arbiter of truth, period,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAnd anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.\u201d",
      "Labeling systems largely didn't help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of \u201cpants on fire,\u201d as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.",
      "Holan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work: \u201cThat attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"",
      "GOP suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism's Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70% of Republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of Democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn't asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52% of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they're reading about elections is true or not.",
      "In a column Wednesday on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticized Republican officials for delivering \u201cmostly false\u201d facts 88 times compared to 31 times for Democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.",
      "But is that bias? Or is it checking facts?",
      "Adair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book: \u201cBeyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\u201d He's not hesitant anymore.",
      "\u201cTrump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI'm not the first to say that. I think he has capitalized on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.\u201d",
      "Tension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump's team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump's second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.",
      "On its own, fact-checking \u201cdoesn't reach those exposed to misinformation,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.org. \u201cIt tends to reach audiences that were already knowledgeable and wary.\u201d",
      "On social media, fact-checking also became part of the algorithms that drove information to people, or away from them. Material labeled as false would often be downgraded so it received less exposure. To Republicans who have criticized Big Tech, that amounted to censorship. Yet to Jamieson, successful fact-checking is not censorship \u2014 \u201cit's the process of arguing.\"",
      "Jamieson expressed some optimism that other smart social media users will step up to prevent the dangerous spread of falsehoods. But for fact-checking as it is today to continue to thrive and, even, exist as a journalistic endeavor, Adair said it will likely take influential Republican figures to publicly stand up for the importance of truth.",
      "NewsBuster columnist Graham, in an interview, had a more pointed piece of advice. \u201cMy remedy in all arguments about media trust,\" he said, \u201cis that humility is required.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The new year is always a good time to make a fresh start \u2014 including with your email inbox. To kick off 2025 with a clean slate, why not clear out all those unnecessary and unwanted messages?",
      "If you're anything like me, you'll have piles of messages that have been accumulating in your inbox: receipts, bank and credit card statements, mobile phone bills, plane tickets, restaurant bookings, reminders, security warnings, spam and more.",
      "Mixed in with all that administrative detritus might be some personal missives from friends and family that are worth keeping.",
      "There are several reasons to purge all that digital clutter. For one, it cuts the risk in case of a data breach. If hackers somehow gain access to your email, they won't have any personal or financial info like credit card details to pilfer.",
      "A decluttered inbox also helps boost productivity and focus because it's easier to find important messages if you don't have to sift through reams of irrelevant ones.",
      "Some productivity proponents advocate inbox zero, a practice that requires dealing with each email that comes in so that by the end of the day your inbox is empty.",
      "But who has the time and energy for that? If you're busy, it's easier to just deal with the messages that need immediate attention and ignore the rest. That is, until the backlog becomes too big.",
      "Here are some tricks to tame your inbox by culling unwanted emails from important ones:",
      "Email accounts used to have limited storage space, say a gigabyte or two at most, which meant that messages with big attachments took up lots of space. Nowadays, email comes with plenty of free storage but it's still good practice to clear out oversized messages because they tend to build up over time. Do you really need to keep all those high-resolution photos of a forgotten friend's grandchildren?",
      "In Microsoft Outlook, click on the \u201cSize\u201d column or button to float the biggest messages to the top, where you can go through and delete them. Outlook also lets users sort by attachment so that messages with added files show at the top. If you want to save the message itself, right click on the attachment to remove it.",
      "In Gmail, go to the search settings to filter out messages that are \u201cgreater than\u201d a certain size. Start at, say, 20 megabytes, and then gradually reduce the number.",
      "Emails from frequent automated senders, such as newsletters and mailing lists, can take up a lot of space in your inbox. Or perhaps you get a lot of security notifications from your bank that might be important in the moment but quickly become outdated.",
      "It's often too tedious to delete them individually so filter your inbox by sender to delete them as a group. In Outlook click the \u201cFrom\u201d column or button. In Gmail or Yahoo mail, use the search bar to look for the sender's email address.",
      "Combine this with another search trick that narrows down the date range to filter out all those old emails that you never got around to deleting. In Outlook or Gmail, you can set a date range to capture emails from, for example, 2010 to 2017, so that you can get rid of, say, all those utility bills you don't need anymore.",
      "Emails from mailing lists tend to include certain words or language that makes it a bit easier to filter them out. One such obvious term is \u201cunsubscribe.\" Searching for a word like that, which wouldn't normally be used in emails written by humans, will identify all the newsletters for easy deletion.",
      "Copying everyone onto an email chain could be viewed as polite and courteous \u2014 or annoying, depending on whether the message topic is relevant to you. Sure, it's a good idea to CC everyone in the office about an important policy that applies to all staff but maybe not about a meeting about Bring Your Child to Work Day if you don't have kids.",
      "In Outlook there's a hack to filter out all those emails where you're not the main recipient. Go to the Home tab, click \u201cRules,\u201d and then \u201cCreate\u201d a rule. Go to Advanced Options, and tick \u201cwhere my name is in the cc box.\" For the next step, you can tick the box to move it to a folder, or even permanently delete it if you're feeling confident.",
      "Gmail users can do something similar with the search function. Type cc: and your email address.",
      "Perhaps you've tried out all these various hacks and whittled down your backlog but still have many more that you haven't gone through. Then it could be time to consider the nuclear option: delete everything.",
      "The benefit of this approach is that it really does provide you with a blank slate. You'll have no more mental anxiety if you don't have any more messages to worry about. The drawback, of course, is that you might lose any messages that might be important or precious.",

      "Tesla, BYD of China, and other manufacturers face big unknowns in 2025. Donald Trump's presidency could mean big policy shifts in tax and other incentives for both electric vehicle makers and consumers. The threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs globally, could further complicate production and sales for electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cThere's just a lot of uncertainty in the air,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of auto intelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIt's not an environment where you want to necessarily go gangbusters.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., consumers can currently claim a federal tax benefit of up to $7,500 for certain new electric vehicles. Carmakers also benefitted from some federal support for electric vehicle production and infrastructure. It's possible for all of that to get cut under President Trump.",
      "Trump condemned the federal tax credit for electric vehicles while campaigning for the presidency. He called it part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d that would would hurt the auto industry. Still, the incoming administration is expected push for broader deregulation of industries, which could potentially help carmakers.",
      "Some of the larger electric vehicle makers had a mixed 2024 even with benefits for consumers and manufacturers. Tesla sales slipped 1.1%, its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years. Rivian's deliveries rose 2.9%.",
      "Tariffs are another threat to the industry. Production takes place globally, with parts getting imported and exported throughout the process. Trump has threatened to tax imports from Mexico, Canada, China and elsewhere, which would likely result in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "China is the largest market for electric vehicles, followed by the U.S. Within the U.S., Tesla is the dominant electric vehicle maker, with about 50% of the market share.",
      "Automakers are in a wait-and-see position along with many other industries to see whether Trump carries out the threat of rescinding tax credits and implementing tariffs.",
      "The broader auto industry is proceeding with caution. Overall, S&P Global Mobility expects that light vehicle production will have slid 1.6% in 2024 and will fall another 0.4% in 2025.",
      "That's a result of automakers better matching production and demand. Overall light vehicle sales are still expected to rise 1.7% in 2025.",
      "The ongoing transition to electric vehicles also plays a role in more tempered production. Companies like Ford and General Motors are shifting production capacity to electric vehicles in some cases instead of adding more capacity."

      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The last deadly crash involving a U.S. airliner occurred in February 2009, an unprecedented streak of safety. But planes have crashed elsewhere around the world. And there are other concerns.",
      "Safety regulators are worried about a number of close calls at airports in the past couple years.",
      "This is not the first time that a passenger has opened an emergency door on a plane on the ground. In one incident in Australia last year, a man opened a door and walked out onto the wing of a stationary plane and was arrested after he climbed down to the ground.",
      "Emergency doors are supposed to be able to be opened when a plane is on the ground so passengers can quickly escape if there is a problem.",
      "Passengers can take comfort in the fact that emergency doors are extremely difficult to open during a flight. There are locks that keep a door in place in flight that are armed after takeoff. And once a plane is above 10,000 feet, the air pressure inside the plane holds the door in place. Most of them are designed so that they must be pulled inward before they can be opened.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel plugging the space reserved for an unused emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner 16,000 feet above Oregon. Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but videos from passengers showed the terrifying scene. The rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling, and suction as air rushed from the hole exerted force on people inside the plane.",
      "Investigators have said it appears that four bolts used to help secure the panel were missing after the plane was worked on at a Boeing factory in Renton, Washington.",

      "The New England Patriots have hired Mike Vrabel as their next head coach.",
      "The team announced the hiring Sunday morning. It comes a week after Patriots owner Robert Kraft fired Jerod Mayo after the team\u2019s season finale victory over the Buffalo Bills to finish 4-13 in his lone season as coach.",
      "Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, former Houston Texans offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton and Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson also interviewed for the job.",
      "But Vrabel, a fan favorite during eight seasons as a player in New England where he was a member of its first three Super Bowl winners and an inductee into the team\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2023, was the preferred candidate because of his long association with the franchise and coaching success during his six seasons in Tennessee.",
      "In hiring the 49-year-old Vrabel, Kraft is turning to another former Patriots defensive standout who, like Mayo, built a reputation as a coach for his ability to relate to players.",
      "But Mayo, who served as assistant under former longtime Patriots coach Bill Belichick, was a first-time head coach and struggled to get results from a young roster led by rookie quarterback Drake Maye. In explaining Mayo\u2019s dismissal Kraft said while he thought he\u2019d identified the successor to Belichick, that in hindsight he now believes Mayo wasn\u2019t quite ready to be an NFL head coach.",
      "In Vrabel\u2019s case, however, he arrives with a head coaching resume burnished by a 56-48 overall record in Tennessee from 2018 to 2023. That includes a 2-3 record in the playoffs and AFC championship game appearance in 2019 as part of a run of three straight postseason berths.",
      "Vrabel served in a consultant role with Cleveland this season, but his contract expired, allowing him to speak with other teams. He also was interviewed by the New York Jets.",
      "The lure of New England won out and now he will look to rebuild the franchise he\u2019s been associated with most during his NFL career.",

      "Unable to reverse the negative momentum of a late-season fade, the Pittsburgh Steelers disappeared from the playoffs with a humbling loss to their fiercest rival",
      "BALTIMORE -- Unable to reverse the negative momentum of a late-season fade, the Pittsburgh Steelers disappeared from the playoffs with a humbling loss to their fiercest rival.",
      "Pittsburgh was eliminated by the Baltimore Ravens, who rolled to a 28-14 victory on Saturday night. The Steelers closed the season with five straight losses.",
      "This defeat, of course, hurt more than the four that preceded it.",
      "\u201cI'm worried less about the regular season,\u201d coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cIn the single-elimination tournament, I\u2019m really just disappointed in how we performed tonight, given the opportunity we had.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh\u2019s strength this season was its defense. The unit was consistently effective in shutting down the run and notched 33 takeaways, tied for the NFL lead.",
      "In this game, however, the Steelers were trampled by star running back Derrick Henry and quarterback Lamar Jackson.",
      "Henry ran for 186 yards and two touchdowns. Jackson carried for 81 yards and also threw a pair of TD passes.",
      "The Ravens finished with a 299-29 advantage in yards rushing. That was too much for Pittsburgh to overcome, but the Steelers never stopped trying.",
      "\u201cThe best part about the game is the guys didn\u2019t give up,\u201d quarterback Russell Wilson said. \u201cIn the National Football League sometimes guys check out. We didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh failed to force a turnover, leaving its offense a long way to go on virtually every possession. Against the Ravens, scoring two touchdowns wasn't nearly enough.",
      "\u201cIn January football, man, you got to score points,\u201d Tomlin said, \u201cand we weren\u2019t able to do that.\u201d",
      "The Steelers were 10-3 and atop the AFC North on Dec. 8 after trouncing Cleveland at home, but that would be their final win.",
      "Pittsburgh's final month of the regular season included a 34-17 loss in Baltimore that propelled the Ravens toward the division crown and a home game to start the playoffs. The Steelers (10-8) also lost to Philadelphia, Kansas City and finally, at home against a Cincinnati team that came in with an 8-8 record.",
      "Pittsburgh has never had a losing record in Tomlin's 18 seasons and has reached the playoffs a dozen times under his direction. Although both streaks continued this season, it's unlikely Tomlin or Steelers fans will look back on this chapter with any sense of pride.",
      "Just as disheartening, the Steelers have lost six consecutive postseason games since an 18-16 win over the Chiefs in January 2017. It's been one-and-done for Pittsburgh over its last five trips to the playoffs, and Tomlin is still striving for his first Super Bowl win since the 2008 season. He moved within one loss of matching Marvin Lewis' dubious NFL record of seven consecutive playoff defeats.",
      "\u201cI'm just assessing what transpired tonight,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cThose are my bags, not their bags. The journey that we were on certainly came to a disappointing end tonight.\u201d",
      "Eager for a fresh start after ending the regular season with a thud, the Steelers stumbled from the outset on a chilly night in Baltimore.",
      "After Pittsburgh's opening possession ended with a punt, Baltimore (13-5) covered 95 yards in 13 plays for a 7-0 lead on a touchdown pass by Jackson to Rashod Bateman. Another three-and-out followed for the Steelers, who were outgained 128-27 in the first quarter.",
      "It soon got worse for Pittsburgh. After another Steelers punt, Baltimore put together an 85-yard drive on 13 plays \u2014 all of them runs \u2014 to go up 14-0.",
      "Just before the half, the Ravens applied another slap in the face to the reeling Steelers. Tomlin called a timeout with 1:08 remaining in hopes of getting the ball back as Baltimore faced a third down on its own 17.",
      "The move backfired. The Ravens zipped downfield and went up 21-0 on Jackson's TD pass to Justice Hill with 2 seconds left.",
      "Pittsburgh finally got into the end zone with a third-quarter touchdown pass from Wilson to Van Jefferson, but Baltimore promptly answered with a 70-yard drive, ending with a 44-yard run by Henry.",
      "The Steelers again closed within 14 points, but that was as close as they'd get. Wilson lamented the defeat, but treasured his first season in Pittsburgh following stays in Seattle and Denver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been truly a blessing in my life, one of the best years for me personally, to be a Pittsburgh Steeler,\" said Wilson, still in uniform long after the final whistle.",
      "He would love to the chance to lead the Pittsburgh offense in 2025.",
      "\u201cI hope I\u2019m here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt gave me so much joy being here. I love black and gold.\u201d",

      "The Ravens move on to face either Buffalo or Houston after jumping out to a 21-0 halftime lead and holding on against their AFC North rivals. Baltimore had a 19-2 advantage in first downs in the first half, when the Ravens produced touchdown drives of 95, 85 and 90 yards,",
      "Henry ran for 186 yards, and Baltimore outrushed the Steelers 299-29. It was the most yards rushing allowed by Pittsburgh in a playoff game, breaking the mark of 232 set by the Oakland Raiders 51 years ago.",
      "Jackson, the two-time MVP still seeking a postseason breakthrough, made it clear from the start he was going to make Pittsburgh (10-8) defend his arm and his legs. He kept the chains moving, and the Ravens (13-5) were happy to advance the ball methodically against a Steelers team that has relied heavily this season on forcing turnovers.",
      "Pittsburgh's season ends with five straight losses, two of which came in Baltimore. The ending was a familiar story for the Steelers, who have lost six consecutive playoff games. The last three times they've been in the postseason, they've fallen on the road in games that have exemplified the gap between Pittsburgh and the conference's true contenders.",
      "The Ravens had 10 touchdown drives of at least 90 yards in the regular season, the most by a team since at least 2000. They started at their own 5 on their first possession and drove 13 plays for a touchdown.",
      "The Steelers have made a habit recently of winning tight games against the Ravens, capitalizing on Baltimore mistakes. The Ravens avoided that problem Saturday, taking few major risks.",
      "They did get creative on the first drive, lining Henry up for a direct snap from center while Jackson came across and faked a sweep. Henry kept the ball for a 34-yard gain. Jackson capped the possession with a 15-yard scoring strike to Rashod Bateman, who was Baltimore's top healthy receiver with Zay Flowers (knee) unavailable.",
      "Jackson went 16 of 21 for 175 yards and rushed for 81.",
      "Henry made it 14-0 with an 8-yard run with 4:09 left in the half. After a Pittsburgh punt, the Steelers called timeout on third-and-2 from the Baltimore 18, hoping to get the ball back, but the Ravens converted and then quickly moved into position to score.",
      "On second down from the Pittsburgh 5 with 11 seconds left, Jackson nearly used up the remaining time scrambling around, but he eventually dumped the ball off to an open Justice Hill, who went into the end zone with 2 seconds left.",
      "The Steelers drove 98 yards for a touchdown on their first second-half possession, with Russell Wilson throwing a 30-yard scoring pass to Van Jefferson. Baltimore quickly answered when Henry broke free up the middle for a 44-yard TD \u2014 Pittsburgh defenders were caught out of position because Jackson faked a run to the left after handing the ball off.",
      "Wilson answered with a 36-yard touchdown strike to George Pickens in the third, but that was it for the scoring. Wilson went 20 of 29 for 270 yards on a night when neither team turned the ball over.",
      "Pittsburgh T Dan Moore Jr. injured an ankle.",
      "The Ravens need Denver to win at Buffalo on Sunday if they're going to host a game next weekend. If that happens, Houston would come to Baltimore. If not, Baltimore would head to Buffalo for a matchup between Jackson and fellow MVP candidate Josh Allen.",
      "The Steelers enter the offseason after Wilson and coach Mike Tomlin were able to get them to the playoffs, but a once-promising season ended with a thud.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- And then there was one: The Big Three is down to just Novak Djokovic, who stands alone from a golden generation of men\u2019s tennis now that Rafael Nadal has joined Roger Federer in retirement.",
      "The Australian Open, which started Sunday (Saturday night EST), is the first Grand Slam tournament of 2025 \u2014 and the first major championship to be held since Nadal, 38, played his final match at the Davis Cup in November. Federer's last match came in 2021, although he didn't announce he was done until 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s coming to an end, this era. It\u2019s tough for us. We grew up watching all of them. We saw them winning all the events,\u201d said Francisco Cer\u00fandolo, a 26-year-old from Argentina who\u2019s been ranked in the top 20. \u201cThen suddenly we started playing against them, sharing the locker room or practicing with them, having conversations with them.\u201d",
      "Djokovic has won 10 of his 24 Slam trophies at Melbourne Park since making his Grand Slam debut there in 2005, and was scheduled to begin his bid for Nos. 11 and 25 on Monday against 19-year-old Californian Nishesh Basavareddy, who recently announced he was leaving Stanford University to turn pro.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice number of years that I\u2019ve been coming to Australia,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cthe place where I had the greatest Grand Slam success.\u201d",
      "One big change for him as he seeks to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles titles: He is being coached, at least for this event, by his former on-court rival, Andy Murray, who retired as a player last August.",
      "\u201cWe thought we\u2019d give it a go and see if I can help,\u201d said Murray, who collected three major titles and two Olympic singles gold medals. \u201cNovak is not just one of the best tennis players of all-time. He\u2019s one of the best athletes of all-time.\"",
      "One other difference this time in Melbourne is that Djokovic was accompanied by his wife and two children.",
      "Basavareddy, roughly half the age of the 37-year-old Djokovic, grew up cheering for the Serb, as did plenty of other current players.",
      "\u201cHe's been my favorite player ever since I started watching (tennis), really,\u201d at about age 6 or 7, Basavareddy said. \u201cJust watched a lot of his matches and tried to learn from him.\u201d",
      "Some opted for Federer, a 20-time major champ, or Nadal, who won 22 Slam titles, as role models, of course.",
      "As time passes, inevitably, Djokovic will move on from his playing days. Just not yet.",
      "And even if he went without a Grand Slam triumph last season for the first time since 2017, the man many call \u201cNole\u201d did manage to collect the only piece of significant hardware missing from his tremendous resume, an Olympic singles gold medal.",
      "Aiming to rebound from what, for him, was a so-so season, hampered by a surgically repaired knee \u2014 the Paris Games success represented his only tournament victory \u2014 Djokovic cut his 2024 short, skipping the ATP Finals, and got to work in the offseason with Murray.",
      "Now folks inside and outside the sport wonder how much, exactly, the No. 7-seeded Djokovic plans to compete and what, exactly, he can continue to win.",
      "\u201cIt was a sad moment when Roger went, because the injuries had a lot to do with it. And Rafa also struggled with injuries. Nole is still quite fit, I have to say,\u201d said Wesley Koolhof, 35, who retired last year with one Grand Slam title in men's doubles and one in mixed doubles. \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to happen at one point that all the legends are going to retire. Nole is still going strong. Who knows how many years he has left in him?\u201d",
      "There is little doubt among his fellow players that Djokovic is not to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cFor me,\u201d said Alexander Zverev, a two-time major finalist who is seeded No. 2 in Australia, \u201che\u2019s still one of the best players in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked what he expects to see from Djokovic in Australia, Carlos Alcaraz smiled and replied: \u201cA really dangerous player.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf he goes to Australia ... hungry,\" said Alcaraz, who beat Djokovic in the past two Wimbledon finals and lost to him in the Olympic final, \"(he) is going to be one of the favorites to win.\u201d",

      "J.J. Spaun twice responded to bogeys with birdies in the closing stretch at Waialae, the last one a pitch-and-putt on the par-5 18th that gave him a 5-under 65 and a one-shot lead over Jaeger, Eric Cole (67) and Patrick Fishburn (68).",
      "Jaeger had a 62 that included a birdie putt from just under 60 week on No. 8, his 17th hole. But he thought back to the bunker shot on the par-3 fourth to 2 feet to save par, and another bunker shot on the par-3 seventh and a 6-foot par save.",
      "\u201cI had just made two birdies the previous holes, and I hit it in the bunker, and I hit the bunker shot close so I didn\u2019t really have to grind very hard,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cBut to make par there kind of kept the momentum going, and I birdied a couple holes after that.\u201d",
      "Spaun was at 13-under 197, and there were 14 players within three shots of his lead.",
      "That's usually the case at the Sony Open. This old-school course with its doglegs and deep bunkers and unpredictable Bermuda rough has a way of staying bunched until the very end.",
      "Jaeger is best known for his Houston Open win over Scottie Scheffler during Scheffler's most dominant part of a dominant year. He was six shots behind going into the third round. He also had 40 players between him and the two players atop the leaderboard.",

      "Fishburn, in his Sony debut as a second-year player out of Utah, was the only player to reach 14 under with his birdie on the par-5 ninth to go out in 31 and create some separation. But he made only one birdie the rest of the way, blasting a drive 360 yards with the wind at his back and hitting a flip wedge that rolled over the cup. He also made three bogeys, and he failed to birdie the par 5 closing hole.",
      "Fishburn dropping a few shots brought many back into the tournament.",
      "Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley birdied his last two holes for a 64 and was in the group two shots behind that included Nick Taylor of Canada (65), former British Open champion Brian Harman (66) and Nico Echavarria of Chile, the Zozo Championship winner in Japan last fall who played bogey-free in the wind for a 66.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we made the turn there, the conditions got quite a bit harder,\u201d Fishburn said. \u201cA lot of the wind was hard off the left with pins on the left, so it was a tricky setup.\u201d",
      "The group three shots behind included Lucas Glover and Gary Woodland, who returned from brain surgery at the Sony Open a year ago and took until later in the year before he got his brain functioning the right way through breathing and meditation exercises.",
      "Woodland, who had a second straight 66, has played at Waialae enough to know it's usually bunched \u2014 Justin Thomas was the exception in 2017 when he set the PGA Tour's scoring record at 253 \u2014 and that a winner can come out of nowhere.",
      "\u201cIf you can get hot, you can make a run,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cIt wouldn't shock me if someone came from behind and posted a number. Everything is trending in the right direction. A couple of guys posted a good number. Hopefully, that's me tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Jaeger stood out with the low round of the tournament. He made a pair of 20-foot birdies on the front nine \u2014 he started on No. 10 \u2014 and got a big boost with a birdie from just under 60 feet on the eighth hole. He finished with a wedge to 4 feet for birdie on the par-5 ninth.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve felt pretty calm and relaxed out there. It\u2019s been a fun week here in Hawaii,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always laid back and easygoing. I\u2019ve been carrying that mindset on the course, and it\u2019s easy to feel that way when things are going your way and you\u2019re playing well. Just try to hone in on that tomorrow and see what happens.\u201d",

      "Harbaugh, who won a national championship with Michigan in Houston last January, took the blame for the loss.",

Stroud joined Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger, Baltimore's Joe Flacco, the New York Jets' Mark Sanchez, Seattle's Russell Wilson and San Francisco's Brock Purdy as quarterbacks to win playoff starts in each of their first two seasons.",
      "Collins finished with seven catches for 122 yards to set a franchise playoff record. Joe Mixon ran for 106 yards and a score. D\u2019Angelo Ross returned a blocked extra point for 2 points for Houston in the fourth quarter.",
      "Herbert was 14 of 32 for 242 yards with a 40.9 passer rating.",

      "They were up 13-6 when Murray scored his first career touchdown on a 38-yard interception return late in the third quarter.",
      "Herbert was picked off again on the next drive when Stingley grabbed a pass that was tipped off tight end Will Dissly. The third overall pick in the 2022 draft intercepted Herbert again late in the fourth quarter.",

      "Deane Leonard intercepted Stroud early in the second quarter, but Lassiter picked off Herbert on the next play to give Houston the ball back. But the Texans couldn\u2019t move the ball and punted.",
      "Stroud and Houston\u2019s offense finally got something going. Houston was facing third-and-16 from its 17 when Stroud fumbled the snap and it rolled 4 yards behind him. He scooped it up and evaded the rush to find Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain.",

      "Attorney General Letitia James said Thursday that she's filed a lawsuit in order to recover more than $2 million that she said was stolen from New Yorkers and others around the country.",
      "James said the unknown network of scammers used unsolicited text messages to target people looking for remote work.",

      "The suit cites seven victims, identified by pseudonyms, residing in New York, Virginia and Florida. One New York victim lost over $100,000, according to the suit. A Florida woman lost over $300,000.",
      "\u201cDeceiving New Yorkers looking to take on remote work and earn money to support their families is cruel and unacceptable,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cScammers sent text messages to New Yorkers promising them good-paying, flexible jobs only to trick them into purchasing cryptocurrency and then stealing it from them.\"",

It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",

      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",

He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",

      "New research shows about a quarter of animals living in rivers, lakes and other freshwater sources are threatened with extinction",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nearly a quarter of animals living in rivers, lakes and other freshwater sources are threatened with extinction, according to new research published Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",
      "The researchers examined around 23,500 species of dragonflies, fish, crabs and other animals that depend exclusively on freshwater ecosystems. They found that 24% were at risk of extinction \u2013 classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered \u2013 due to compounding threats from pollution, dams, water extraction, agriculture, invasive species, climate change and other disruptions.",
      "\u201cMost species don\u2019t have just one threat putting them at risk of extinction, but many threats acting together,\u201d said Sayer, a study-co-author.",
      "The tally, published in the journal Nature, is the first that time researchers have analyzed the global risk to freshwater species. Previous studies have focused on land animals including including mammals, birds and reptiles.",
      "Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study, called it \u201ca long-awaited and hugely important paper.\"",
      "\u201cAlmost every big river in North America and Europe is massively modified\" through damming, putting freshwater species at risk, he said.",
      "In South America, the vast Amazon River ecosystem also faces threats from deforestation, wildfires and illegal gold mining, said Charvet.",
      "Illegal fires to clear forest result in waves of ash polluting the river, and unlicensed gold miners dump mercury into the water, she said.",
      "Rivers and wetlands \u201cconcentrate everything that happens around them,\" she said. \"If something goes really wrong, like an acid or oil spill, you can threaten an entire species. There\u2019s nowhere else for these animals to go.\u201d",

      "Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately",
      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",

      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",

      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

      "Chipmaker Nvidia has unveiled new technology for gamers and creators at CES 2025",
      "LAS VEGAS -- In a packed Las Vegas arena, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang stood on stage and marveled over the crisp real-time computer graphics displayed on the screen behind him. He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "The chipmaker and AI darling unveiled its GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs \u2014 its most advanced consumer graphics processor units for gamers, creators and developers. The tech is designed for use on both desktop and laptop computers.",
      "Ahead of Huang's speech, Nvidia stock climbed 3.4% to top its record set in November. Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing even as criticism rises that their stock prices have already shot too high, too fast. Despite worries about a potential bubble, the industry continues to talk up its potential.",
      "Huang said the GPUs, which use the company\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell, can deliver breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering.",
      "\u201cBlackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,\u201d Huang said, adding that Blackwell \u201cis the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.\u201d Blackwell technology is now in full production, he said.",
      "Building on the tech Nvidia released 25 years ago, the company announced that it would also introduce \u201cRTX Neural Shaders,\u201d which use AI to help render game characters in deep detail \u2013 a task that's notoriously tricky because people can easily spot a small error on digital humans.",

    "summary": "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",

And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is telling residents whose homes or businesses were damaged or destroyed by wildfires this week to not sign anything right away -- to be a little patient.",

      "Lara emphasized during an ABC7 live interview that first and foremost you should access safety, stay away from the disaster area and don't rush into any decisions. There is a three-day cooling-off period that residents are allowed before they need to make any decision with a public adjuster.",
      "\"Often what we've seen, unfortunately, throughout multiple fires in different years throughout the state, is you start seeing out-of-state adjusters come in, trying to, you know, cut a deal with homeowners, saying you know, 'We can give you 70% of what you are entitled to when you are really entitled to 100% -- or depending on what your policy says,\" Lara explained about people being vulnerable to fraud during theses stressful and traumatic times.",
      "By pausing and waiting to sign, people can catch a potential fraud before it's too late. Lara said people can call the insurance department to check the insurance adjuster's license. He also advised people to call their insurance company before signing anything with an adjuster.",
      "\"We're just asking people to call our department, do not sign anything under duress,\" Lara said. \"This is a very traumatic moment ... and we want to let them know that please look out for fraud, do not sign anything, and we're here to be able to help them through the entire process.\"",
      "Lara emphasized people should call the California Department of Insurance. They have live operators on the phone that can help address your issues. You can contact them at 1-800-927-4357 or visit insurance.ca.gov.",
      "\"It's very important that you know you have somebody on your side,\" Lara said. \"The department is here to be your advocate during this very stressful and really traumatizing time for our community.\"",
      "When trying to figure out your insurance coverage, Lara said the most important thing you need is a copy of your home insurance policy.",
      "\"You also have to take note of your additional living expenses, limits in your policy and also track all of your additional expenses,\" he added. \"And you have to make sure you document all conversations with your insurer or an adjuster.\"",
      "As wildfires across the state became more prevalent and destructive, insurance companies have started dropping coverage for homeowners in fire-prone areas or significantly raising policy rates. Lara told ABC7 there is a law in place that doesn't allow insurance companies to drop coverage to areas within a year of a wildfire, giving business and families time to make decisions about their futures.",
      "See if you're protected or if your zip code is included in the moratorium on nonrenewals here.",
      "Another way to keep insurance companies in communities is to decrease the risk of fire damage to your home, Lara said. Homeowners can do that by making the home is up to code, the roof is updated and harden the house against flames.",

      "\"Contrary to the agent's 1921 report, the situation did not 'spontaneously' grow out of control,\" the new report said. \"Rather, what had initially been sporadic and opportunistic violence became systematic, yielding a much more devastating result, due to coordinated efforts among white residents and law enforcement entities. Moreover, although the 1921 report asserts that the massacre (then called a riot) was not the result of 'racial feeling,' perpetrators of the massacre overtly expressed and acted upon racial bias.\"",
      "Investigation provides detailed timeline of violence",
      "At the time of the massacre, Tulsa was dubbed \"Black Wall Street\" due to the thriving businesses and community established by Black residents. However, white residents who lived in the city and nearby towns harbored a deep resentment, which built up in the years leading to the attack, the report said.",
      "Investigators from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"spoke with survivors and with descendants of survivors, examined firsthand accounts of the massacre given by individuals who are now deceased, studied primary source materials, spoke to scholars of the massacre and reviewed legal pleadings, books, and scholarly articles relating to the massacre,\" according to the DOJ.",
      "The investigation determined the attack was triggered by an unfounded condemnation alleging 19-year-old Dick Rowland assaulted a white woman who operated an elevator he used. The department said this tactic was commonly used to justify violence against Black residents.",
      "After a local newspaper sensationalized the story, a mob of white Tulsans gathered outside the courthouse, demanding a lynching, according to the report.",
      "When a local sheriff called a group of Black World War I veterans to come to the courthouse to prevent the lynching, the white mob grew, and a shot rang out, the investigation found.",
      "The Tulsa police exacerbated the conflict by deputizing hundreds of white residents, many of whom were \"advocating for a lynching and had been drinking,\" the report said.",
      "\"Law enforcement officers helped organize these special deputies -- as well as other white Tulsans -- into the martial forces that ravaged Greenwood. Over the next several hours, they looted, burned, and destroyed 35 city blocks while Greenwood's residents tried desperately to defend their homes,\" the report said.",
      "\"Some Black residents were shot (or otherwise assaulted), and many were arrested or detained,\" it continued. \"Law enforcement actively participated in the destruction, disarming Black residents, confiscating their weapons, and detaining many in makeshift camps under armed guard.\"",
      "By the morning of June 1, the violence and arsons had become \"systematic.\"",
      "Left with nothing",
      "Although city officials offered to rebuild and help the victims, they not only failed to do so but put up barriers, the report said.",
      "\"White local leaders rejected outside aid, claiming they could handle the recovery, but then provided little to no financial support. Instead, claiming the area was best suited for industrial use, they imposed harsh new fire codes that priced residents out of the area, although a court later enjoined those provisions,\" the report said.",
      "\"Compounding the injustice, insurance companies denied Black residents of Greenwood compensation due to the 'riot clause' in their policies,\" it added. \"Legal attempts to hold the city accountable also failed. Black residents of Tulsa were left with no avenue for redress.\"",
      "No legal avenues left for justice",
      "Due to the statute of limitations and the fact that the perpetrators and almost all of the survivors and witnesses of the attack are long dead, the Justice Department cannot take any legal action for the crimes committed, the report concluded.",
      "\"The report recognizes that some may find the department's inability to prosecute a painful or dissatisfying outcome,\" the DOJ said in a statement. \"However, the review recognizes and documents the horrible events that occurred as well as the trauma and loss suffered by the residents of Greenwood.\"",
      "Family members of survivors said they were not given notice of report",
      "The DOJ said it would be meeting with Greenwood District officials, survivors and descendants of the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Tulsa civil rights community and other stakeholders to discuss the probe.",
      "DOJ members held a meeting at the Historic Vernon AME Church in Tulsa on Saturday to discuss the report.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the family of two of the survivors, Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, however, expressed disappointment with the DOJ, claiming they were not given notice about the report.",
      "Solomon-Simmons said in a statement that he was only made aware of the report after his office saw news reports. Furthermore, he said his team was not told of Saturday's meeting at the church.",
      "\"Neither my legal team nor the massacre survivors will be able to attend due to time constraints amid our ongoing review and discussion with the DOJ,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Solomon-Simmons said he and his team will have further comment after they review the report and speak with the DOJ.",
      "The DOJ did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment about Solomon-Simmons' claims.",
      "ABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report."

    "story": [
      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

    "title": "Struggling to keep your New Year's resolutions? Here's how to keep yourself on track",
    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 20:12:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Why do millions make New Year's resolutions knowing the odds of them ever following through with them are minimal? Fitness expert Jasper Rook Williams has some advice.",
    "story": [
      "\"Your goal might be set in stone, but how you achieve it shouldn't be.\"",
      "LONDON -- It is one thing to make a New Year's resolution. It is, however, a very different thing to be able to keep it.",
      "Every year they are made with the best of intentions -- with the hope and desire to become a better version of ourselves -- so why is it that millions of people make New Year's resolutions knowing the odds of them ever following through with them are minimal?",
      "Jasper Rook Williams -- fitness expert, online coach and owner of JRW Fitness -- has made a successful career so far working with hundreds of clients around the world on improving their nutrition, training and lifestyle calibration. He has a good idea why.",
      "\"The goals, if sometimes a little ambitious, are rarely the problem and they are all set with best intentions,\" Rook Williams tells ABC News. \"The issue is there's rarely enough thought put into the approach. People have high ambitions hinging on mostly unrealistic and unsustainable methods. Rather than just thinking 'I'll eat salads and join a gym', people need to prioritize achievable routines, sustainability and lifestyle changes from a broader and more holistic perspective.\"",
      "According to research, Rook Williams isn't wrong. The failure rate for New Year's resolutions is said to be an estimated 80% with most people losing their resolve and motivation just weeks later in mid-February, according to U.S News and World Report.",
      "\"Changing your habits is very difficult, including finding the right moment to make a change,\" Bas Verplanken, professor of social psychology at the University of Bath, said in a report released by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in 2017. \"Changing from December 31st to January 1st is not a dramatic discontinuity. Many resolutions are made on December 31st, and go down the drain on January 2nd.\"",
      "Psychologically speaking, the beginning of a new year is often viewed as a seminal moment -- a time to reflect on the previous year and look ahead to the new one. But this doesn't necessarily translate to immediate change and action just because of timing.",
      "Perhaps unsurprisingly, the top three New Year's resolutions made each year are living healthier (23%), personal improvement or happiness (21%) and losing weight (20%), according to a report published by Statista in Nov. 2022.",
      "\"A great question to ask yourself when starting out is \"does this feel sustainable?\" Rook Williams explains to ABC News. \"If you can't keep up the routine then you definitely won't keep the results.\"",
      "One of the things that Rook Williams has found leads to people maintaining their success is when people have -- or are given -- a sense of accountability.",
      "\"You have to bear in mind that creating new habits is hard and progress for anything worthwhile is never linear,\" he said. \"There will be times when either you want to stop or results seem to have stopped and that can be hard to deal with. That's when having someone to guide you can keep you accountable can be invaluable in the process of change.\"",
      "Ultimately, to successfully make a change for the better, it comes down to striking the right balance, according to Rook Williams.",
      "\"In the case of fitness, it's not just the food or training or wider lifestyle that will create the change but all three of these things working together,\" he continued. \"They're not mutually exclusive. Lacking motivation is common and, in my experience, is something that comes when you don't have a plan. Whether you hire a professional or not, just removing the guesswork and gaining a sense of direction always helps the individual on their path to success.\"",
      "One of the biggest obstacles to maintaining resolutions, particularly when it comes to fitness objectives, is to choose goals that are both achievable and sustainable.",
      "An estimated 12% of all new gym memberships per year occur in January, according to a study done by IHRSA, the fitness industry's only global trade association that represents health clubs worldwide. Another study indicates that four out of every five people who join the gym in January will actually quit within five months.",
      "\"Motivation is temporary for everyone,\" says Rook Williams. \"So the best thing you can do is use that time to create the habits and routines needed to see you through once it wanes. And it will wane. It always does. The classic thing new gym starters do in the new year is go from zero to 100 mph \u2026 They want to go from not working out at all and eating what they want to training five, six, seven days a week and eating like a rabbit. This just sets them up for failure because it's just not realistic.\"",
      "One of the biggest reasons why Rook Williams' clients often succeed when it comes to setting goals is the focus on maintaining a healthy outlook every day and \"saying no to short-termism.\"",
      "\"Being new at something and hoping to be perfect straight away is a sure fire way to give up on anything very quickly,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Be sure to cut yourself some slack. If you planned to train three days one week but only managed two, that doesn't make you a failure. It's still two more than you were doing before, so just wipe the slate clean and try it again without holding on to guilt or punishing yourself.\"",
      "\"Everyone falls off the horse at some point, even the pros,\" Rook Williams continued. \"What's important is how quickly you dust yourself off and get back to work. Those who make it do this right away. But those who let one mistake spill over into more mistakes are the ones who are most likely to give up and start again next year.\"",
      "No matter what resolution you may make in the New Year, for Rook Williams, success is all about perspective and making changes in incremental ways that suit your lifestyle rather than completely disrupting it.",
      "\"There is never just one solution to a problem, whatever that problem might be,\" he continued. \"Your goal might be set in stone, but how you achieve it shouldn't be. Don't get married to just one method. Finding sustainable success is all about finding the method that is easiest and most maintainable for you.\"",
      "Unrealistic expectations and the dangers of expecting to get it right the first time are one of the main things that Rook Williams warns his clients about.",
      "\"With so much conflicting information out there and each of us having our own unique goals, schedules and responsibilities, the chance of getting your nutritional approach spot on when going alone immediately is incredibly slim,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Even if it is working, it might not be sustainable so be prepared for a period involving a lot of trial and error.\"",
      "For Rook Williams this was a huge reason why he became a coach in the first place. \"It took me ages to piece it all together and, once I had, I wanted to help others do the same and in far less time.\"",
      "Research actually backs this up. According to a 2012 study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Weight and Eating Disorders Program, 65% of dieters return to their pre-diet weight within three years and only 5% of people who lose weight on a restrictive diet, such as a liquid or no-carb, manage to keep the weight off -- just one out of every 20 dieters.",
      "\"Carbs are tasty, alcohol can be fun, food is for eating and going without all these things forever is, for most people, totally unrealistic. When you think about it logically like that, it's no surprise the majority of people fail to keep off the weight they lose.\"",
      "Ultimately, making any major change in your life requires more than just the desire to do so. It requires a goal, determination and a willingness to learn all mixed with a heavy dose of reality and a well-constructed approach to change.",
      "\"If you have a day where you feel like you can't be bothered with anything, remember you are running your own race,\" Rook Williams explains. \"Success isn't made by being perfect everyday but by doing your best everyday, whatever that looks like to you. What I have learned myself -- and what I have really seen leads people to success -- is if you have good habits and routines in place that you have created over time, that's what is going to get you to where you want to be.\"",
      "Said Rook Williams: \"It's not just the food or training or wider lifestyle that will create the change but all three of these things. They're all connected.\"",

      "Six years before packing a rental truck with firework mortars and gas cannisters before shooting himself in the head -- an act he called a \"wake-up\" call to America in a note later found by law enforcement -- Army Master Sgt. Matthew Livelsberger told an ex-girlfriend he was spiraling.",
      "\"Sometimes, I get so hopeless and depressed, it's [expletive] ridiculous,\" he texted, at one point describing a close-range firefight in which he killed two men.",
      "\"By far the worst of my life,\" he wrote in 2018.",
      "The violent death of Livelsberger, a 37-year-old decorated war veteran and Green Beret, on New Year's Day is reviving questions about the unique risks that military personnel, and in particular special operations forces, face in their jobs and whether enough is being done to identify members in crisis.",
      "Experts say the military has dramatically ramped up access to mental health support in recent years but that special operations forces in particular still remain vulnerable, in part out of fear that if they seek help their careers will be sidelined.",
      "SOF personnel are more frequently exposed to the kinds of severe mental trauma that can trigger post-traumatic stress syndrome, as well as repeated concussive blasts from high-powered weapons that military officials suspect cause scarring and other physical changes to the brain.",
      "Acute stress and relationship problems also can play a role in a person's deteriorating mental state. In a 2020 study sponsored by U.S. Special Operations Command that examined the suicide deaths of 29 special operations personnel, nearly all of them experienced emotional trauma in their first deployments. But other issues factored in as well, the study found.",
      "\"The downhill trajectory with compounding relationship issues, financial issues and legal issues occurs over many years,\" the report found, noting the \"large number of variables\" typically involved.",
      "In the case of Livelsberger, the Army will soon have to decide whether his nearly two decades of service as a special forces soldier with nine overseas deployments contributed to his death.",
      "Enlisted by the Army in 2006 to train as a member of its special forces, Livelsberger became a member of the 10th Special Forces Group, which conducts counterterrorism and training missions around the world. He deployed five times to Afghanistan, as well as had stints in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo.",
      "Livelsberger was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire. He also was awarded an Army Commendation Medal with valor.",
      "His ex-girlfriend Alicia Arritt, who shared her text exchanges with Livelsberger with ABC News, said she remembered the Green Beret as funny, generous and kind and someone who loved children. He also liked art, basketball and fast cars. She said he was not impulsive.",
      "If the Army finds that his suicide was caused by his service and \"in the line of duty,\" Livelsberger's survivors would receive increased benefits.",
      "With an FBI investigation ongoing, the Army has said only that Livelsberger participated in a holistic treatment program offered to special operations forces called the \"Preservation of the Force and Family\" program but that there were no red flags. The program, called POTFF, includes \"physical, cognitive, medical and support resources as appropriate to each individual.\"",
      "Livelsberger, who was stationed in Germany at the time, didn't display any \"concerning behaviors\" and was granted personnel leave shortly before his death, a spokesperson said.",
      "\"We encourage our Soldiers, if they need help, mental health treatment or need to speak with someone, to seek proactive behavioral health treatment either on base or online. They also have the option of talking to an Army chaplain,\" Brig. Gen. Amanda Azubuike, chief of Army Public Affairs, said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry and the neuroscience of trauma at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, said there are risk factors that seem to explain why some people are more vulnerable to PTSD than others.",
      "This can include a person's family history, exposure to trauma at a young age and biological factors that could make it more difficult for a person to \"recalibrate\" their nervous system after a traumatic event.",
      "Yehuda, who is not involved in Livelsberger's case and did not want to speak to his particular situation, said the trauma faced in general by service members in combat can be particularly challenging because it often occurs overseas when members are far away from close family and friends who can provide support. That support system, she said, can be critical to calming the nervous system.",
      "\"I think that we have to understand that trauma is a real thing. And it can really be detrimental to mental health, especially if you're not in an environment where people can help you cope with all the things that you're carrying,\" she said.",
      "Fran Racioppi, a former 10th Special Forces Group officer who hosts a podcast on Green Berets and leadership, said the profile of a Green Beret soldier is unique because it's someone capable of \"extreme degrees of compassion\" while also capable of going to war and maintaining the highest standards in warfighting.",
      "\"Whenever we have an incident when the behavior of a special operator drastically deviates from the standard profile, we need to understand the driving cause of that change and what contributing factors may cause a grievance,\" he said.",
      "Racioppi said he thinks the resources are there to support personnel like Livelsberger.",
      "\"But the first step will always be an operator's self-assessment and willingness to seek help for themselves,\" he said.",
      "The SOCOM-sponsored study, conducted by the American Association of Suicidology, found at the time of its review, from 2012 through 2015, that many personnel were reluctant to raise their hands out of fear of getting sidelined, with suicide prevention training seen as a \"check in the box.\"",
      "Livelsberger's ex-girlfriend Arritt said he told her he feared getting help \"because he wouldn't be deployable.\"",
      "Sara Wilkinson, a suicide prevention advocate whose Navy SEAL husband died by suicide, said that while PTSD can be prevalent in the military, it's not an arbitrary label that can be used to explain everyone's experience. Wilkinson's husband, Chad, was found to have suffered a unique type of brain scarring found in other deceased Navy SEALS.",
      "Service members should know their story in life also can be one of tremendous resilience, she said.",

      "Bryan Vejar, associate director of community forestry for TreePeople, an environmental nonprofit that works to expand tree equity across Los Angeles, said city arborists have shown him \u201csobering\u201d photographs of large trees knocked onto homes and parkways from the same powerful winds that sent fires out of control. Other images show scorched tree canopies.",
      "The Santa Ana winds damaged trees in TreePeople\u2019s primary focus areas of South Los Angeles, Watts and Inglewood, historically underserved neighborhoods with less shade.",
      "The air is still so bad that field crews cannot yet go out and work safely. When they do, he said, they expect to to find young trees snapped, broken or dried out.",
      "New trees are vulnerable, and volunteers often have to go out and water them for the first few years.",
      "\u201cEvents like this can greatly increase our mortality rates,\u201d Vejar said.",
      "Past fires and extreme winds have torn off many limbs and taken down trees, especially ones planted in narrow strips of land where there isn't room for much soil, Vejar said.",
      "When it\u2019s safe to conduct field assessments, urban tree experts will go out to inspect, re-stake and retie trees toppled by winds, and remove and replace those that were lost.",
      "Replanting trees in burned neighborhoods is harder now because of climate change, said Will Berleson, a professor at USC\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences and researcher with the university\u2019s Urban Trees Initiative. Even though many of the city\u2019s mature trees might only be 30 or 40 years old, they \u201cstarted growing at times when it was not as hot and didn\u2019t have these kinds of wet and dry fluctuations that we seem to be seeing now,\u201d he said.",
      "Some experts see tree losses as an opportunity to continue teaching Los Angeles residents about the place they live and what plants are the best fit, not necessarily the iconic ones of Hollywood movies. They would like to replace nonnative species like palms \u2014 which are more closely related to grasses \u2014 with trees that provide shade and can withstand extreme heat and drought.",
      "Aaron Thomas, director of urban forestry at the environmental nonprofit North East Trees, said trees such as the coast live oak are a good option. They are native to the region and are fire resilient \u2014 in fact, they need to burn to reproduce, he said.",
      "Thomas, who grew up in Altadena, has family members who lost homes to the Eaton Fire. His brother\u2019s home burned, but the five coast live oaks in his backyard survived.",
      "For him it's another reminder that cities need to think about how we rebuild in general and how we reforest communities with native flora: \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d",
      "But planting trees with climate-resilient features such as large canopies isn't always easy, and cities must consider community input when deciding what to plant. Trees that provide a lot of shade can make it difficult for drivers to see around corners, for instance. Where space is at a premium, sometimes there\u2019s just not enough room above or below ground to plant them.",
      "Berleson added that it will take a long time for neighborhoods to look like what they did before the fires.",
      "Trees provide myriad benefits. They clean the air and improve mental health. They capture stormwater runoff and replenish groundwater. And during heat waves that are getting hotter and deadlier, shade trees cool the air and urban surfaces.",
      "Vejar said his group knows there will be setbacks, but that is the reality we're living in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s climate change. It\u2019s water restrictions. It\u2019s extreme weather events,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so in the face of this, all we can do is continue to build and rebuild and steward our urban forests in such a way that makes it more resilient in the face of these extreme weather events.\u201d",

      "The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have taken lives and thousands of homes",
      "For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County\u2019s Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic.",
      "Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles.",
      "Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid\u2019s adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 190-acre (77-hectare) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire.",
      "Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days.",
      "For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.",
      "They have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Orde\u00f1ana's children attend.",
      "\u201cThe community has been devastated by the fire,\u201d said Orde\u00f1ana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don\u2019t know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes.\u201d",
      "Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Orde\u00f1ana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22.",
      "Orde\u00f1ana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week.",
      "All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School.",
      "The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday.",
      "During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter\u2019s outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind.",
      "Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it\u2019s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon.",
      "\u201cThe nature center is gone,\u201d Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. \u201cThe wildflowers, the shrubs are gone.\u201d The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly.",
      "\u201cTeachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature \u2014 wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment,\u201d he said.",
      "Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said.",
      "\u201cFor many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won\u2019t be able to use it for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable.\u201d",
      "Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of \u201cWild L.A,\u201d a field trip and nature guidebook.",
      "A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.",
      "\u201cFor children\u2019s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important,\" she said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife.",
      "\u201cA lot of the places that we\u2019re talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon,\" said Greg Pauly, co-author of \u201cWild L.A.\u201d and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. \"I do think it\u2019s safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it\u2019s certainly going to be a while before that happens.\"",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, many elected officials in Republican and Democratic states are preparing to either aid or oppose his policies",
      "Do you live in a red state, a blue state, or one where Republicans and Democrats share power?",
      "Your answer might provide the best indicator of what to expect from your governor and state lawmakers as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and legislatures convene.",
      "In many cases, political party identification has come to define public policy, percolating from the nation\u2019s capital down to the 50 statehouses.",
      "Many Republican state officials are aligning with Trump's policies by pledging to help him crack down on illegal immigration, for example. Some Democratic state officials are mounting a resistance movement, looking for ways to shield their states from potential federal policies restricting abortion and transgender rights, among other things. Some prominent Democratic governors, meanwhile, have taken a more conciliatory approach in an effort to forge a working relationship with the new administration.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect in some policy areas:",
      "Governors and lawmakers in red states are lining up behind Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the U.S. illegally. A joint statement from 26 Republican governors said they \u201cstand ready to utilize every tool at our disposal \u2014 whether through state law enforcement or the National Guard \u2014 to support President Trump in this vital mission.\u201d",
      "Republican lawmakers in a growing number of states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring a recent Texas law that has been placed on hold while courts consider whether it unconstitutionally usurps federal authority. One bill in Missouri would offer a $1,000 reward to informants who tip off authorities about people in the country illegally and allow private bounty hunters to find and detain them.",
      "Governors in some blue states are taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump's immigration plans, willing to cooperate on deporting people who commit crimes but not in using the National Guard for widespread roundups of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Other Democratic-led jurisdictions are bracing for a showdown. The California Legislature has convened a special session to erect shields against Trump's policies on immigration and other issues.",
      "Most U.S. abortions are carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures, and that is where the current abortion fight is focused.",
      "At least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have bills introduced aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing a New York doctor, claiming she wrongly prescribed via telehealth and sent pills to a Texas woman, even though a New York law aims to protect such prescriptions.",
      "And the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are in court trying to roll back federal approvals of one of the pills usually used in abortion.",
      "Several efforts to expand the use of public money to pay for kids to attend private school suffered high-profile defeats in the November elections, including in Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado.",
      "But Trump\u2019s victory is seen as a boon for such efforts, which in recent years have exploded in popularity. A dozen states, almost all red, have programs allowing any student to apply for government funding for private education, including at religious schools.",
      "With Trump in office, states could see more incentives such as block grants or tax benefits to adopt or expand models like vouchers, which subsidize private school tuition for families. Texas, for example, is expected to see momentum on the school choice front, with a number of voucher proponents winning seats in the Legislature.",
      "Many conservative states also are pushing to bring Christianity into public K-12 education through moves such as requiring schools to teach the Bible and post the Ten Commandments. Trump has promised to promote prayer and Bible reading in schools, with current courts more amenable to religion in the public sphere, including schools.",

      "Attorneys general and legislatures in red states also are likely to put pressure on the private sector to pare back DEI initiatives. A Tennessee law provides one model, forbidding financial institutions from considering a customer\u2019s participation in \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion training.\u201d",

      "In his campaign last year, Trump leaned into attacks on transgender rights, suggesting a looming shift in federal policy.",
      "The future of some of the measures could rest on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected this year on whether Tennessee had the right to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",

The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century because it prevents tooth decay.",
      "Arkansas lawmakers have filed bills to repeal a statewide fluoridation program and allow local public water systems to hold elections so residents can decide whether to put fluoride in the water. Montana also has a proposed bill to \u201d ban the use of fluoride,\u201d though the full text of the bill isn\u2019t available yet.",
      "Vaccination laws and mandates are still in play in state governments, too. Alabama may consider changing its vaccination laws to require parental consent for any vaccine to be given to a minor age 14 or older; currently, children that age can decide whether they want medical services. Wyoming has a bill that would impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 on a business or entity that gets state or federal money if found to discriminate based on whether someone is wearing a mask, has had a COVID-19 vaccination or has been tested for COVID-19.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 18:50:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of department turmoil",
    "story": [
      "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of department turmoil",
      "Kristin Crowley was elevated to Los Angeles fire chief in 2022 at a time of turmoil in a department consumed by complaints of rampant hazing, harassment and discrimination among its 3,400-member ranks. As a career firefighter, she was portrayed by the then-mayor as a stabilizing force.",
      "Three years later, the mood between Crowley and City Hall has changed.",
      "The wildfire in Pacific Palisades that has burned more than 5,000 structures to become the most destructive in city history has put leaders on the defensive and led Crowley to engage in a public spat with Mayor Karen Bass over resources even as the battle against flames continues across the Los Angeles area.",
      "Crowley publicly criticized the city Friday for budget cuts that she said have made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs at a time when they are seeing more calls. She also cast blame on the city for water running out Tuesday when about 20% of the hydrants tapped to fight the Palisades fire went dry.",
      "\u201cI'm not a politician, I\u2019m a public servant. It\u2019s my job as the fire chief for Los Angeles city fire dept to make sure our firefighters have exactly what they need to do their jobs,\u201d she told CNN.",
      "Her comments and perceived falling-out with Bass prompted so much speculation about her job security that the union issued a statement Friday assuring rank-and-file members that she had not been fired.",
      "The following day the mayor sought to tamp down the tension.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear about something: The fire chief and I are focused on fighting these fires and saving lives, and any differences that we might have will be worked out in private,\u201d Bass said at a news conference. \u201cBut right now our first and most important obligation to Angelenos is to get through this crisis.\u201d",
      "This followed several days of Crowley getting swept into the national political fray over diversity, equity and inclusion policies that conservatives believe have gone too far in American institutions. Crowley, who is openly gay and the city\u2019s first female fire chief, has made diversifying the overwhelmingly male department a priority.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing (was) largely preventable,\u201d talk show host Megyn Kelly said on her show. \u201cLA\u2019s fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no evidence that Crowley\u2019s efforts to diversify the department have hampered the fight. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is in charge of providing water for the hydrants, and its leaders have said they were overwhelmed by the intense demand on a municipal system not designed to fight wildfires, particularly as firefighting aircraft was grounded. Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into what happened, and Crowley herself added to the criticism.",
      "\u201cWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there's going to be water,\u201d she said during a local news interview.",
      "Philadelphia Managing Director Adam K. Thiel, who previously served as that city\u2019s fire commissioner, suggested that people reserve judgment until the fires can be investigated. He noted that firefighters cannot control the weather, a key factor in battling wildfires.",
      "\u201cFirefighting, to a regular person, probably appears to be a relatively simple process of putting water on a fire,\u201d said Thiel, who knows Crowley and praised her experience. \u201cIn reality every firefighting operation, in any environment, is inherently volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti appointed Crowley to the job amid complaints about a frat house culture in the department that was sometimes hostile to women and minorities. Several lawsuits alleged hazing and harassment, and federal investigators found evidence of discrimination.",
      "At the time Crowley was sworn in, women accounted for just 3.5 percent of the uniformed membership, a figure that\u2019s not unusual for a department. A survey found that half the uniformed women in the department \u2014 along with 40% of Blacks, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders \u2014 felt harassment was a problem.",
      "Crowley, whose wife is a retired firefighter, told the Los Angeles Times in 2022 that she planned to ensure all of employees \u201ccome to work and feel safe and feel heard.\u201d",
      "Two years later, she was facing budget cuts that she warned could hamper the department's ability to respond to emergencies, including wildfires. She highlighted the elimination of civilian positions and $7 million in overtime pay.",
      "The reduction in overtime has limited the department\u2019s ability to prepare and train for \u201clarge scale emergencies,\u201d such as wildfires and earthquakes, Crowley said, and programs like air operations. The department has also lost mechanics, leading to delays in repairing the vehicle fleet, she said.",
      "Other city officials say the department's budget was later boosted, but it's unclear how much of that went to firefighting resources. Bass has said the department has the resources needed to do its job and she will address specifics once the crisis subsides.",
      "Crowley, who grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, came to firefighting after what she called \u201ca really unique journey.\u201d",
      "A high school and college athlete, she studied biology at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Notre Dame, Indiana, with plans to become an orthopedic surgeon. Two weeks after graduation, she moved to California.",
      "A stint as a paramedic changed her career path. She did an internship with the fire department and was hooked.",
      "\u201cThat was it,\u201d she told WBAY-TV in Green Bay in March 2022. \u201cWithin a few seconds of me entering into the fire station, it was just such a wonderful connection to what I had being a student-athlete for the majority of my life, and I tell you, it was a perfect fit.\u201d",
      "Crowley has now been with the department for a quarter century, serving in nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief. Garcetti had described Crowley as not only a trailblazer but the most qualified person.",
      "\u201cThe protection of our city first and foremost has to go to the human being who is best prepared to lead. But let me be clear, that is Kristin Crowley,\u201d he said.",

      "A Florida state agency is suing a company owned by the family of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida state agency is suing a company owned by the family of U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, saying the company overcharged the state by nearly $5.8 million for work done during the pandemic and won't give the money back.",
      "The lawsuit comes at the same time that a congressional ethics investigation concluded the South Florida Democrat may have violated U.S. House rules and federal law with her campaign activities and how she has used her congressional office. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Dec. 30 in state court in Tallahassee by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The agency claims that it made a series of overpayments to Trinity Healthcare Services, based in Miramar, after hiring Trinity in 2021 to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations. The agency says it discovered the problem after a single $5 million overpayment drew attention.",
      "\u201cTrinity took advantage of the state of emergency the entire country was encountering due to the COVID-19 pandemic and knowingly processed an invoice more than 100 times its typical invoice size,\" the suit says.",
      "Lawyer Gabriel Imperato, who represents the company, declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time. She was elected to Congress in 2022 in the 20th District representing parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties in a special election after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. Cherfilus-McCormick won the primary in the heavily Democratic district by five votes. She was reelected without opposition in November.",
      "In a report from the Office of Congressional Ethics released on Jan. 2, the agency found that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services. The House Ethics Committee hasn't acted on the report.",
      "During the 2021-2022 campaign cycle, Cherfilus-McCormick reported loaning her campaign millions of dollars.",
      "The ethics report found that there was reason to believe that Cherfilus-McCormick made nearly $270,000 in unreported payments to a Florida state political action committee in 2021 and 2022 for campaign work. The report found that Cherfilus-McCormick may have also improperly accepted in-kind contributions.",
      "The report also found that Mark Goodrich, whom the report described as Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign manager, improperly produced videos and mailers that Cherfilus-McCormick sent out using her congressional office.",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick has said the report doesn't mean she has done anything wrong."

      "After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- After he was found in contempt twice in one week, Rudy Giuliani faces another potentially treacherous week ahead at a trial to determine whether his Florida condominium and three World Series rings must be turned over to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation award against him.",
      "The former New York City mayor was found in contempt on Friday by a Washington judge for repeating false claims that the workers corruptly counted votes in the 2020 presidential election. Last Monday, a New York judge found him in contempt for failing to adequately turn over evidence about his assets.",
      "On Thursday, Giuliani, 80, faces trial in New York over whether he can keep his Palm Beach, Florida, condominium, which he asserts he established as his permanent residence a year ago, and whether he must turn over three World Series rings that he says he gave to his son in 2018.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman, who will preside over the juryless trial in Manhattan federal court, is the same jurist who found Giuliani in contempt last Monday.",
      "With his contempt order, Liman made rulings setting Giuliani back in the upcoming trial. He said Giuliani cannot offer testimony about texts or emails to show that he moved his residence to Florida since he failed to turn over any texts or emails as part of the pretrial exchange of evidence between lawyers.",
      "Liman said he can also make adverse inferences about \u201cgaps\u201d in evidence resulting from Giuliani\u2019s failure to turn over materials, including by rejecting any claims that Giuliani changed his professional services, such as doctors and lawyers, to individuals practicing in Florida after Jan. 1, 2024.",
      "Giuliani has conceded that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested in the case because he believed what was being sought was overly broad, inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "A request for comment Saturday was sent to a spokesperson for the former private attorney to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "At a November hearing, Giuliani said he was \u201cnot impoverished,\u201d but his assets were tied up because of multiple legal proceedings he faces in several states.",
      "Liman also issued an order several days ago asking all sides to describe whether the World Series rings Giuliani purchased from the New York Yankees should be stored with the court for safekeeping until it can be decided who will get them.",
      "Lawyers for Andrew Giuliani said the rings are safely located in the bedroom closet of his New York City residence in a doorman building.",
      "The judge raised the possibility of the court keeping the rings after Giuliani testified last Monday that he doesn't know what happened to a valuable signed Joe DiMaggio baseball jersey after he last saw it at his Manhattan apartment about four months ago.",
      "Following the testimony, lawyers for the election workers submitted written arguments to refute the claims that Giuliani gave the rings to his son in 2018. They noted, for instance, that Giuliani's bankruptcy submission in 2023 listed the rings among his property.",
      "The Florida property and World Series rings are the primary assets still in dispute from a portfolio of Giuliani assets that was estimated to exceed $10 million. The Palm Beach condominium is believed to be worth more than $3 million.",
      "He has already given up assets including a New York City apartment worth about $5 million, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and numerous luxury watches and other belongings.",
      "The Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, won the defamation judgment against Giuliani after saying his lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives."

      "But a half dozen current and former law enforcement officials in Louisiana described the bollard issue as a red herring, saying that even if they had been functioning they may not have prevented the attack given how hell-bent Jabbar appeared on creating carnage.",
      "The broader safety conundrum is more complex, they said, given the quarter's dense, alcohol-fueled crowds and structural challenges inherent to an early 18th-century neighborhood built for horse-drawn buggies. Policing here is even more complicated in a city with notoriously high crime, a chronic shortage of officers and a new state law allowing permit-less concealed carry of firearms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of another place that has the same challenges for protecting people,\u201d said Ronnie Jones, a public safety consultant who served in the Louisiana State Police for 32 years, including as deputy superintendent.",
      "\u201cA lot of people in public safety don\u2019t want to talk about it, but we just can\u2019t guarantee that everybody going to the French Quarter is going to be safe,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradeoff here, and we\u2019ve never, ever, found that balance.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s newly hired security consultant, William J. Bratton, a former New York City police commissioner, said he recognizes the importance of maintaining a festive atmosphere during carnival even as he works with city police to bolster security over the next few months.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I talked about is developing security provisions that don\u2019t change Mardi Gras, don\u2019t change the flavor of it, the excitement of it and the nature of it,\u201d Bratton said at a news conference this week. \u201cTo develop security protocols that don\u2019t become so intrusive, so disruptive.\u201d",
      "The New Year's attack was far from the first deadly vehicle incident on Bourbon Street.",
      "In 1972, one person died and 18 were injured when a teenager fleeing police in a stolen car crashed through metal barricades and sped down the thoroughfare at 70 mph (about 113 kph). Ten years later a man smashed through steel barricades and careened down nearly seven blocks, injuring at least 11. And in 1995, an intoxicated 63-year-old man drove a beer van through a crowd attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, killing one and injuring 38.",
      "More recent Bourbon Street tragedies have involved gun violence, including multiple fatal shootings last year. In 2014, a mass shooting killed a 21-year-old woman and wounded nine others, including a bystander shot through her cheek. Two years later a person was killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting.",
      "Many of those incidents prompted similar calls for change and accountability, raising questions about civil liberties and what, if anything, the city is willing to sacrifice in the name of public safety. City, state and federal law enforcement officials have offered varying solutions that critics have said were mere stopgaps, likening them to putting Band-Aids on a wound that has never quite healed.",
      "\u201cI was part of those conversations when we were looking to create a very robust security package, including metal detectors and infrared technology that could alert if something metal was in someone's clothing \u2014 none of that ever materialized,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a former head of New Orleans police who later became commissioner in Baltimore. \u201cThere are ways to prevent ramming attacks. There\u2019s not yet a way to prevent people from walking on Bourbon Street and doing bad things.\u201d",
      "Pedicab driver Jody \u201cCajun Queen\u201d Boudreaux, 65, said Bourbon Street has always embodied New Orleans' laissez-faire charm and she is not sure whether the city has the will to shore up its lax security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a target, clearly. They know we have holes, they know we are all scrambling and they also know that our vibe is \u2018Laissez les bons temps rouler\u2019\u201d she said, invoking the famous Cajun French saying that means, \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d \u201cI think it can be balanced, I truly do.\u201d",
      "Andrew Monteverde, co-vice president of the New Orleans Firefighters Association, said first responders and law enforcement deal with a raft of emergencies, from extinguishing fires to saving people in cardiac arrest. The more that limited resources are dedicated to one part of the city, he added, the less is available to deal for elsewhere.",
      "\u201cCould you possibly make the French Quarter so secure that you couldn\u2019t even spit on the sidewalk?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, but then what would you trade off?\u201d",
      "At The Beach on Bourbon Street, where workers screen clubgoers at every entrance with handheld metal detectors, general manager Woody Ryder has become inured to the frequent shootings after working there for seven years. \u201cThere's crazy people out there,\u201d he said.",
      "But the recent attack has made him uneasy. Ryder and his staff are still recovering from witnessing what he and others likened to a \u201cwar zone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe city has already failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant as soon as I turn on Bourbon Street.\u201d",

      "An increasing number of Democrats are questioning whether their party\u2019s commitment to diverse candidates, especially women, may lead to more political struggles in the Trump era",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Democrats are harboring strong feelings of stress and gloom as the new year begins. And many are questioning whether their party's commitment to diverse candidates \u2014 especially women \u2014 may lead to further political struggles in the Donald Trump era.",
      "A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that a significant number of Democrats believe that it may be decades before the United States will get its first female president.",
      "Specifically, about 4 in 10 Democrats said it\u2019s \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely\u201d that a woman will be elected to the nation\u2019s highest office in their lifetime, according to a December AP-NORC poll. That\u2019s compared with about one-quarter of Republicans who feel the same.",
      "While despondency is hardly unique for a political party after a high-profile loss, that finding reflects the deep depression that has set in among Democrats about the country and their party after Trump soundly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.",
      "Such concerns may already be shaping the Democratic National Committee\u2019s search for a new leader. For the first time in more than a decade, the top candidates for the job are all white men.",
      "And looking further ahead, the party\u2019s pessimism is influencing early conversations about the contest for the 2028 presidential nomination.",
      "\u201cWe knew men hated women. The last election showed, for some of us, that we underestimated the extent to which some women hate other women,\u201d said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a Democratic state representative from South Carolina and former president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. \u201cAmerica is as racist and misogynist as it has always been.\u201d",
      "Democrats have nominated a woman to run against Trump in two of the past three presidential elections. In both cases, Trump won decisively, over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Harris in 2024. The Democrat who unseated Trump \u2014 Joe Biden in 2020 \u2014 was a white man.",
      "Adding insult to injury for many Democrats was the long list of allegations brought by women against Trump. He was found liable in civil court for sexual abuse and convicted for a hush money case involving an adult film star. He was once caught on tape bragging that he could grab women's genitals without consent because he was a celebrity.",
      "Still, Trump narrowly carried every key swing state in November. Harris had the advantage among women, winning 53% to Trump\u2019s 46%, but that margin was somewhat narrower than Biden\u2019s. Trump's support held steady among white women, with slightly more than half supporting him, similar to 2020.",
      "Most Democrats \u2014 about 7 in 10 \u2014 believe 2025 will be a worse year for the U.S. than 2024, the AP-NORC poll found. That\u2019s compared with about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who feel that way.",
      "The poll also found that Democrats were less likely to be feeling \u201chappy\u201d or \u201chopeful\u201d about 2025 for them personally. Instead, about 4 in 10 Democrats said \u201cstressed\u201d described their feelings extremely or very well, while roughly one-third of Democrats said this about the word \u201cgloomy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, majorities of Republicans and conservatives said \u201chappy\u201d described how they feel about 2025 at least very well. A similar share said the same about \u201chopeful.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so dark out there right now,\u201d said poll respondent Rachel Wineman, a 41-year-old Democrat from Murrieta, California. \u201cMy family and I are circling the wagons, trying to keep our heads down and survive.\u201d",
      "There are early signs that this loss has triggered questions about a core commitment of the modern-day Democratic Party to support minority groups, including women, while pushing diverse candidates into positions of power.",
      "Some Democratic leaders fear that Trump\u2019s strong success with working-class white voters \u2014 and his modest gains among Blacks and Latinos in the election \u2014 may signal a political realignment that could transform the political landscape for years to come unless the party changes its approach.",
      "The vote for a DNC chair offers the first clue as to the direction of the party during the second Trump administration. The election is three weeks away, and the leading candidates are Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin state chair, and Ken Martin, the Minnesota state party chair.",
      "Either would be the first white man in the job since Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine left the position in 2011.",
      "Martin and Wikler are considered the strong front-runners in a field of eight candidates who qualified for a DNC candidate forum Saturday, the first of four such gatherings before the Feb. 1 election at the committee's winter meeting in suburban Washington.",
      "Two candidates are women: former presidential contender Marianne Williamson and Quintessa Hathaway, a former congressional candidate, educator and civil rights activist.",
      "The outgoing chair, Jaime Harrison, who is Black, said in a statement that the committee will be well-positioned to compete in future elections and push back against Trump's policies.",
      "\u201cDemocrats stand ready to hold him accountable,\u201d Harrison said. \"We will continue to invest in all 50 states to build power from the local level on up and elect Democrats across the country.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, some rank-and-file Democrats in early primary states are openly wondering whether the party\u2019s next White House nominee would be at a disadvantage if that person is not a straight white man who is Christian. Barack Obama is the only Black man to have been elected president in American history.",
      "New Hampshire Democrat Thalia Flores said Harris\u2019 loss has made her rethink the political viability of rising stars such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the most prominent woman expected to weigh a 2028 presidential bid.",
      "\u201cKamala\u2019s loss can impact those kind of candidates, too, because anybody who\u2019s not a mainstream white guy is maybe not a good bet,\u201d Flores said, indicating that such concerns would not affect her personal vote in the next presidential primary. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we\u2019re even having the conversation.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cThe American people can\u2019t seem to support a woman.\"",
      "Overall, the AP-NORC poll found that about one-quarter of Americans said it was extremely or very likely that the country will elect a woman as president in their lifetime. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults thought it was somewhat likely and about one-third said it was not very likely or not at all likely.",
      "Such feelings are consistent among Americans regardless of age or gender, although Black Americans are more likely than white or Hispanic adults to say it\u2019s \u201cnot very likely\u201d or \u201cnot likely at all\u201d to happen in their lifetime.",
      "Sarah Burnett, a 49-year-old small business owner from Edgerton, Missouri, said she\u2019s feeling \u201cdread\u201d about the direction of the country in 2025.",
      "\u201cAll of us are not looking forward to the next four years,\u201d she said.",
      "As for whether she thinks the U.S. will elect a woman in her lifetime, she said she\u2019s trying to be optimistic.",
      "\u201cYes, there\u2019s going to be sexism involved, misogyny, the patriarchy and all of that. \u2026 But we did have a Black president,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cSo yes, I would expect a woman to be elected. Do I have high expectations? No.\"",

      "Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump, an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.",
      "The department disclosed Smith's departure in a court filing Saturday, saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated , follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump's White House win in November.",
      "At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump's co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.",
      "The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.",
      "But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.",
      "In an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.",
      "The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump's efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon's injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.",
      "The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon's order was \u201cplainly erroneous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department,\" the Justice Department said. \"The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.\"",
      "Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work, and it\u2019s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.",
      "William Barr, attorney general during Trump's first term, released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.",
      "Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also released special counsel reports, including about Biden\u2019s handling of classified information before Biden became president."

For some, it was a first look at the staggering reality of what was lost as the region of 13 million people grapples with the gargantuan challenge of overcoming the disaster and rebuilding.",
      "Calmer winds enabled firefighters to start gaining some control of the biggest blazes in metropolitan LA on Friday before gusty weather returns over the weekend to an area that hasn\u2019t seen rain in more than eight months. But by Friday evening, new evacuations were issued in an area that includes The Getty museum as the eastern side of the Palisades Fire flared up, nearing Interstate 405.",

      "Since the fires first began popping up around a densely populated, 25-mile (40-kilometer) expanse north of downtown LA, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. No cause has been identified yet for the largest fires.",
      "Allegations of leadership failures and political blame have begun and so have investigations. Gov.

She also criticized the lack of water.",
      "\u201cWhen a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there\u2019s going to be water,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 11 people have been killed, with five from the Palisades Fire and six from the Eaton Fire, according to the LA County medical examiner's office. Officials said they expected that number to rise as cadaver dogs go through leveled neighborhoods to assess the devastation to an area larger than San Francisco.",
      "Officials on Friday set up a center where people could report those missing. Tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers).",
      "The disaster took homes from everyone \u2014 from waiters to movie stars. The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage, but private firms have estimated it will climb into the tens of billions. The Walt Disney Co. announced Friday it will donate $15 million to respond to the fires and help rebuild.",

      "Neighbors wandered around ruins Friday as they described now-vanished bedrooms, recently remodeled kitchens and outdoor living spaces. Some talked about the gorgeous views that drew them to their properties, their words contrasting sharply with the scene of soot and ash.",

      "Buturovic is one of many animal owners in Los Angeles who scrambled to get themselves and their beloved companions out of the way of fast-moving wildfires that killed 11 people and burned more than 12,000 homes and other structures this week. It has overwhelmed shelters, whose leaders have implored people, if they're able, to find friends or family to foster their pets.",
      "Wendy Winter and her husband decided Tuesday evening that they should buy some cat carriers so they could evacuate their Altadena home with their felines Purry Mason and Jerry. Less than two hours later, it was clear they needed to leave. The next morning, they learned the house they lived in for more than seven years was gone along with the rest of their street.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s fear and loss and you just don\u2019t even know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re hoping to find friends to foster their cats for two months while they figure out what they\u2019re going to do next. Winter said she and her husband are disoriented, and they aren't sure they can provide their cats an environment where they will feel safe and comfortable right now.",
      "Some people took their pets to shelters because they couldn\u2019t evacuate with them.",
      "The Pasadena Humane Society took in 250 pets in the first day after the fires started. Los Angeles County Animal Care was looking after 97 pets \u2014 mostly cats and dogs but also pigs, a turtle, a bird, and a snake, said Christopher Valles, a department spokesperson.",
      "Veterinarian Dr. Annie Harvilicz had been moving out of an old Animal Wellness Centers office in Marina del Rey, but inspired by her brother's need to find a place for his pets, she turned the exam, X-ray and surgery rooms into an impromptu shelter. She quickly took in 41 dogs, cats and a bunny and soon found foster homes for all but two.",
      "She told people on Facebook to contact her if they needed a place for their animals. She expected an onslaught of pets needing refuge but instead has been inundated with people wanting to volunteer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the people of Los Angeles and how I really feel like they\u2019ve stepped up to the plate when it comes to helping out each other,\u201d she said.",
      "Some people wanted Harvilicz to take their donkeys but she wasn\u2019t able to get a trailer to them before they had to evacuate. Difficulties transporting larger animals puts them at greater risk from wildfires, she said.",
      "Julia Bagan, who is part of a Facebook group called Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation, found five horses locked in their stalls in Altadena one day after the fire. The horses huddled in a small exterior pen attached to the stalls but couldn\u2019t entirely escape the flames.",
      "By the time a neighbor called for help and firefighters used bolt cutters to free them, one of the horses was badly hurt, Bagan said.",
      "She drove through the remnants of the fire Wednesday night to rescue them as damaged power lines sparked overhead. She described it as \u201cthe most crazy, dangerous\u201d evacuation she\u2019s had yet. Almost all the houses in the area had burned when she pulled up.",
      "The injured horse, a 3-year-old black mare she decided to name after the movie Flicka, had leg burns. Her halter burned off, along with her tail and mane. The embers gave her eyes ulcers.",
      "A veterinarian at an emergency equine hospital gave the horse 50-50 odds of surviving.",
      "\u201cShe just had no chance, getting left locked in a stall and her owners evacuating and just leaving them all there,\u201d Bagan said.",
      "But some horse owners were ready.",
      "When Meredith McKenzie got a notice days before of the heightened fire risk, she asked people at her barn to help evacuate her horse so she could focus on caring for her sister who has Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "\u201cHorse people are not stupid about if there\u2019s fire coming. We\u2019re out before it starts because once that smoke happens, the horses go nuts and go crazy,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to corral them because they just want to run.\u201d",
      "The ranch where she kept her horses, the historic Bob Williams Ranch on Cheney Trail, burned, she said. McKenzie lost her equipment but another ranch has said they\u2019ll give her a saddle and bridle.",
      "Suzanne Cassel evacuated Tuesday from Topanga with her two horses, a donkey named Oscar Nelson, four dogs and two cats. They rushed to nab a spot at a large animal emergency shelter at Pierce College, a community college in Woodlands Hills.",
      "Her horses are together in the shelter, while the dogs and cats are staying in the horse trailer. Her donkey, though, was feeling down in a stall by himself.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lonely, so I just went inside and sat in the stall with him for half an hour, and he liked that because nobody likes to be alone when you\u2019re a herd animal,\u201d she said.",
      "Buturovic, who runs the dog rescue shelter, took some of her canines to Harvilicz\u2019s old hospital and others to a friend\u2019s home in Venice.",
      "By the time she returned to the Topanga ranch Wednesday morning, it had burned. The cement building that withstood two or three other fires since the 1950\u2019s was covered in soot, its roof gone and windows blown out. Her ponies disappeared, along with two semi-feral dogs she fed. She\u2019s hoping to raise money to support Philozoia, her non-profit organization that rescues animals from high-kill shelters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to go from here,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to introduce more Christianity to public school classrooms, testing the separation of church and state",
      "WASHINGTON -- Conservative lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to introduce more Christianity to public school classrooms, testing the separation of church and state by inserting Bible references into reading lessons and requiring teachers to post the Ten Commandments.",
      "The efforts come as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office pledging to champion the First Amendment right to pray and read the Bible in school, practices that are already allowed as long as they are not government-sponsored.",
      "While the federal government is explicitly barred from directing states on what to teach, Trump can indirectly influence what is taught in public schools and his election may embolden state-level activists.",
      "Trump and his fellow Republicans support school choice, hoping to expand the practice of using taxpayer-funded vouchers to help parents send their children to religious schools.",
      "But there is a parallel push to incorporate more Christianity into the mainstream public schools that serve the overwhelming majority of students, including those of other faiths. And with the help of judicial appointees from Trump's first presidential term, courts have begun to bless the notion of more religion in the public sphere, including in schools.",
      "\u201cThe effect of even Trump being the president-elect, let alone the president again, is Christian nationalists are emboldened like never before,\u201d said Rachel Laser, the president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.",
      "Large numbers of Americans believe the founders intended the U.S. to be a Christian nation. A smaller group, part of a movement widely called Christian nationalism, champions a fusion of American and Christian identity and believes the U.S. has a mandate to build an explicitly Christian society.",
      "Many historians argue the opposite, claiming the framers created the United States as an alternative to European monarchies with official state churches and oppression of religious minorities.",
      "Efforts to introduce more Christianity into classrooms have taken hold in several states.",
      "In Louisiana, Republicans passed a law requiring every public school classroom to post the Ten Commandments, which begin with \u201cI am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\u201d Families have sued.",
      "In Texas, officials in November approved a curriculum intertwining language arts with biblical lessons. And in Oklahoma, the state superintendent of education has called for lessons to incorporate the Bible from grades 5 through 12, a requirement schools have declined to follow.",
      "Utah state lawmakers designated the Ten Commandments as a historic document, in the same category as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, so teachers could post it in their classrooms. Many other states have seen legislation that would put them in more classrooms. And attorneys general from 17 GOP-led states recently filed a brief supporting Louisiana's Ten Commandments mandate.",
      "Schools are permitted \u2014 and even encouraged \u2014 to teach about religion and to expose students to religious texts. But some say the new measures are indoctrinating students, not educating them.",
      "Critics have raised concerns also about proliferating lesson plans. Some states have allowed teachers to use videos from Prager U, a nonprofit founded by a conservative talk show host, despite criticism that the videos positively highlight the spread of Christianity and include Christian nationalist talking points.",
      "During his first administration, Trump commissioned the 1776 Project, a report that attempted to promote a more patriotic version of American history. It was panned by historians and scholars who said it credited Christianity for many of the positive turns in U.S. history without mentioning the religion's role in perpetuating slavery, for example.",
      "The project was developed into a curriculum by the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan and is now taught in a network pf publicly funded charter schools supported by the college. It also has influenced state standards in South Dakota.",
      "Challenges to some state measures are now working their way through the courts, which have grown friendlier to religious interests thanks to Trump's judicial appointments.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a football coach in Washington state who was fired for praying with players at midfield after a game, saying the school district infringed on his rights to religious expression. Dissenting justices noted some players felt pressure to join the coach. But the high court said a public school can't restrict an employee's religious activity just because it could be construed as an endorsement of religion, reversing a five-decade precedent.",
      "The ruling could pave the way for conservatives to introduce more Christianity in public schools, said Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s judicial appointees have emboldened states\u201d to test the separation of church and state, he said.",
      "In the wake of the football coach's case, courts now analyze church-state separation through the lens of history, said Joseph Davis of Becket, a public interest law firm focused on religious freedom that is defending Louisiana over its Ten Commandments mandate.",
      "The Supreme Court has endorsed the idea that \u201cit\u2019s OK to have religious expression in the public spaces,\" Davis said, \"and that we should sort of expect that ... if it\u2019s a big part of our history.\u201d",
      "Critics say some measures to introduce more historical references to Christianity in classrooms have taken things too far, inserting biblical references gratuitously, while erasing the role Christianity played in justifying atrocities perpetuated by Americans, like genocide of Native people.",
      "These are among the criticisms facing the new reading curriculum in Texas. Created by the state, districts aren't required to use it, but they receive financial incentives for adopting it.",
      "\u201cThe authors appear to go out of their way to work detailed Bible lessons into the curriculum even when they are both unnecessary and unwarranted,\u201d religious studies scholar David R. Brockman wrote in a report on the material. \u201cThough religious freedom is vital to American democracy, the curriculum distorts its role in the nation\u2019s founding while underplaying the importance of other fundamental liberties cherished by Americans.\u201d",
      "Texas Values, a conservative think tank that backed the new reading curriculum, said in a statement that the court's pivot toward permitting more Christianity in schools, and allowing more taxpayer money to flow to religious institutions, is corrective.",
      "The football coach case has rightfully returned protections for religion and free speech in public school, said Jonathan Saenz, the Texas Values president.",
      "\u201cVoters and lawmakers (are) getting tired of the attacks on God and our heritage of being \u2018One Nation Under God,'\u201d he said.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- With an outdoor public inauguration ceremony canceled due to winter weather, new North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein instead planned to kick off his term in office with a televised address indoors.",
      "Stein was to deliver a speech on Saturday in Raleigh, instead of the originally scheduled swearing-in ceremony outside the old Capitol building for the Democratic governor and other statewide executive branch officials within what is called the Council of State.",
      "Forecasts for snow, sleet and freezing rain Friday and parts of Saturday prompted the state inaugural committee to call off public festivities, including a block party that could be rescheduled. Official inauguration parties Friday and Saturday night also were postponed.",
      "Stein and several Council of State members \u2014 the lieutenant governor, attorney general and state treasurer among them \u2014 had already taken their official oaths in private or in small ceremonies early in the new year. Stein, who succeeded term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, gave a brief speech at his Jan. 1 swearing- in. Saturday's address, being streamed by North Carolina public television, was expected to go longer.",
      "Stein, the attorney general for the past eight years who defeated then-Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in November, already has signaled the Hurricane Helene recovery as a top early-term priority. He has visited western North Carolina twice since Jan. 1 and issued a half-dozen executive orders on the state government's response to the historic flooding.",
      "Republican state legislative leaders sounded hopeful on the General Assembly's opening day this week that they could work with Stein to approve more hurricane recovery money early in 2025.",
      "On more partisan issues, Stein is in a better position compared to Cooper since 2023 to permanently block legislation that he vetoes. Republicans are now one House seat short of holding a veto-proof majority in the legislature, meaning Stein's vetoes can hold if House Democrats remain united.",
      "When Cooper became governor in 2017, approaching snow and sleet forced cancellations of a public swearing-in ceremony and inaugural parade. Four years later, after Cooper\u2019s reelection, COVID-19 restrictions derailed gatherings. A made-for-television inauguration ceremony for Cooper and other Council members was held outside the Executive Mansion."

      "Her trip has been overshadowed by UK borrowing costs hitting a 16-year high and a fall in the value of the pound, with the Conservatives accusing Reeves of having \"fled to China\".",
      "Speaking during a visit to UK bike maker Brompton's Beijing store, Reeves insisted she would not alter her economic plans.",

    "summary": "Why Rachel Reeves needs a more detailed growth strategy - and soon.",
    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",
      "Bidenomics without the money and without Biden is much too thin. A more detailed strategy for sustained growth is needed, and in short order.",

      "By last year, that had increased to 18%, according to the IFS - an independent economic think-tank.",
      "That equates to about 450,000 more young adults still living in the family home - with the increase concentrated on those in their late 20s, researchers found.",
      "Of 25 to 34-year-olds, men were more likely than women to be living at home, at 23% compared with 15%.",
      "The IFS said that this age group had changed over recent decades, so had become less likely to be married and have children. They were also more ethnically diverse, and UK-born young people from Bangladeshi and Indian backgrounds were more likely to live with their parents.",
      "The peak of adult children living at home was during the pandemic, when more than a fifth of 25 to 34-year-olds did so.",
      "Now, in more normal times, parents may hope their grown-up children would fly the nest, but many of the 20-somethings would wish they could afford to do so.",

      "Danny, who works for a local council, said he wanted to live independently but had found himself with an \"ever-dwindling\" amount of leftover money each month to save for a house. Prices were rising and saving enough for a deposit on his own was difficult, he said.",
      "\"Eventually you've got to make a real hard decision of, actually, do I save for longer or do I bite the bullet, move back home and try and save more money consistently?\" he said.",
      "Some of his friends had been given money by their parents towards a deposit but Danny said his family was unable to help him financially - instead offering a place to stay so he could save up.",
      "He pays his parents for rent and groceries but is able to save \"significant chunks of money each month\", and hopes to buy his own house this year.",
      "Savings challenge",
      "The IFS concluded that some young people could make savings by living at home. About 14% had accumulated more than \u00a310,000 in a two-year period, compared with an estimated 10% of young adults in private rented accommodation.",
      "However, this was not true across the board owing to the potential of higher commuting costs, or because some had moved owing to financial difficulties.",
      "\"For some, living with parents provides an opportunity to build up savings more quickly than if they were renting \u2013 which is an especially valuable advantage in high-cost places like London,\" said Bee Boileau, research economist at IFS and an author of the report.",

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",

      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",

      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",

      "Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce will expand its Goodwood factory and global headquarters to meet the growing demand for bespoke models.",
      "It will invest more than \u00a3300 million so it can build more highly-customised versions of its cars for its super-rich clientele.",
      "Although UK petrol and diesel car sales are due to be phased out by 2030, the boss of Rolls-Royce declined to say whether the firm would stop selling cars with combustion engines to clients abroad.",
      "Rolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, down from its record of 6,032 in 2023, but the total value of its sales was higher due to it selling more bespoke builds.",
      "While those numbers may seem tiny compared with the millions of cars delivered each year by mainstream manufacturers, Rolls-Royce operates in a highly rarefied market.",
      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",
      "As a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.",
      "Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce's boss said rising demand for personalised vehicles was helping to offset that decline.",
      "The 120-year old British brand came under full control of German carmaker BMW in 2003 and officially opened its Goodwood site in West Sussex the same year. Rolls-Royce says this expansion secures its future in the UK.",
      "'Holographic paint and one-off artworks'",
      "For some customers, simply owning a Rolls-Royce isn't exclusive enough. In recent years, the company has increasingly focused on building highly-customised versions of its cars, which can then be sold at even higher prices. Its rivals also do this.",
      "This has included cars with holographic paint, containing one-off artworks, or featuring intricate hand-stitched embroidery. One model, designed as a homage to the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, includes features made out of solid 18-carat gold.",
      "That is generating \"more complicated commissions\" and \"driving the need\" to expand Goodwood to have more space, Rolls-Royce chief executive Chris Brownridge told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "But making individually tailored cars, while profitable, is a labour-intensive process that requires time and space.",
      "At the same time, like other manufacturers, the company is preparing for a future in which conventional cars will be phased out and replaced by electric models.",
      "In the UK, the Labour government has committed to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and is consulting car manufacturers on how that will work.",
      "Mr Brownridge declined to tell the BBC whether the firm would still be building cars with combustion engines for clients abroad in 2030, but said the firm had a \"very clear roadmap\" and that electric cars were the \"right direction for Rolls-Royce\".",
      "A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said under current plans and legislation, Rolls-Royce would still have the capability to build combustion engine cars in 2030, if that is what clients want.",
      "However, he said that five years \"is a long time\", and legislation may change, adding that by then it may not be feasible for the firm to build such cars.",
      "Rolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space\" for building bespoke cars.",
      "It added that the plan would \"also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future\".",
      "The carmaker has already been granted planning permission for the expansion of the Goodwood plant, which was built in 2003 and initially housed 300 workers. There are currently more than 2,500 people working on the site, with a further 7,500 in the UK supply chain.",
      "Mr Brownridge said the Goodwood investment confirms the company has \"a very secure business for the long term\", so those jobs \"are very much safe\".",
      "\"Our business will potentially grow in terms of those more sophisticated commissions [and] in terms of the number of people that we need,\" he added.",
      "In the US, President-elect Donald Trump has threatened much higher tariffs on vehicle imports.",

      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",

      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",

      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

      "Schools say that means they will struggle to fund the government's proposed pay rise for teachers, as well as the support needed for children with special educational needs.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said it would work with schools and local authorities to provide a \"fair funding system that directs public money to where it is needed\".",

      "Staff pay usually takes up the majority of a school budget. The government has suggested teachers' pay should go up by 2.8% for the school year beginning September 2025, in line with plans for school spending.",

      "The school has received financial support from a private donor to set up a forest school.",

      "The IFS says per-pupil spending in mainstream schools rose by about 11% between 2019 and 2024, when adjusted for inflation.",

      "The \"absolutely fantastic\" parent-teacher association has also raised \u00a320,000 in the last year through sponsored challenges, film nights and discos at the school.",
      "In the past, this money would go to \"cherry-on-top\" activities like play equipment. But now, it has to fund basic curriculum resources like buying paper, Mr Hitchcock says.",
      "Staff costs take up 85% of the school's budget. Mr Hitchcock says pay rises are \"very important\" to recruit and retain staff, and to make sure it's a competitive profession.",
      "The government's recommended 2.8% pay rise for teachers next year is being considered by the independent teacher pay review body.",
      "Education unions have already described the proposal as being disappointingly low, but Mr Hitchcock says he does not know where he will find the extra money, even without any further increases.",
      "\"A nearly 3% pay rise is going to mean I have to find \u00a330,000, which just isn't possible,\" he says.",

      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",

      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",

      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",

      "Tumbling into the BBC's Maida Vale studios, the band are boisterous and charming, the sort of people to greet a perfect stranger like a long-lost cousin.",
      "Bandleader and drummer Femi Koleoso has a room-filling smile and a zest for life that infuses his music.",
      "\"We're just trying to bring something positive and joyful to whoever will listen,\" he says. \"So anything that exposes us to more people is always gratefully received.\"",
      "Today, that means the honour of being named runner-up in the BBC's Sound Of 2025.",
      "The annual poll, which has been running since 2003, has tipped everyone from 50 Cent and Adele, to Raye and Dua Lipa for success.",
      "Ezra Collective's addition to the list comes relatively late in their career. They've already won the Mercury Prize, for their second album Where I'm Meant To Be, and last November, they became the first jazz act to sell out Wembley Arena.",
      "But to their minds, the band are still newcomers.",
      "Koleoso recalls the thrumming intensity of making his Wembley debut.",
      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",
      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",
      "Reviews were ecstatic, calling the show a \"masterclass in musicianship\" that left \"every single person with a smile on their face.\"",
      "As a result, Ezra Collective's name will be added to the Wembley Wall \u2013 but Koleoso wants it to have a radically different effect.",

      "Community and musical kinship is Ezra Collective's foundation stone; one that can be traced back to the youth club Tomorrow's Warriors, where they first met in central London in 2012.",
      "The charity offers training to musicians who can't afford private tuition, with a special focus on \"those with a background from the African Diaspora and girls, who are often under-represented in the music industry\".",

      "When Koleoso first visited Tomorrow's Warriors with his brother TJ, they'd already formed a tight rhythm section in their church band. In fact, Femi had been playing drums since he was four.",
      "\"Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I think the drums are the best instrument, because you can see what's going on,\" he says.",
      "\"When I watch our horn section, I'm hearing thousands of notes, but I'm only seeing three valves. It doesn't quite make sense. But with the drums, you hit them and they make a sound.",
      "\"I wish everything was as simple as that.\"",
      "Tomorrow's Warriors introduced Koleoso to jazz, a genre he'd previously considered elite and inaccessible, and to his future bandmates James Mollison (sax), Ife Ogunjobi (trumpet) and Joe Armon-Jones (keyboards).",
      "Together, they ripped the genre rulebook to shreds, magpie-ing elements of Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime, reggae, Latin, R&B, highlife and jazz to create a sound that bulges with possibility.",
      "\"We're the shuffle generation,\" explains Koleoso. \"We listen to Beethoven and 50 Cent comes on straight after. That influences the way we approach music: We love jazz but at the same time I love salsa too, so why not try and get that in there?\"",
      "After playing their first gig in a Foyles bookshop, they released their debut EP, Chapter 7, in 2016, and a debut album, You Can't Steal My Joy in 2019.",
      "Then Covid hit.",
      "\"We were meant to do a world tour but shortly after we arrived in New Zealand, we were told get back to London because the world was collapsing,\" says Koleoso.",
      "Lockdown inspired their second album, but instead of introspection and gloom, it's an immensely energetic record, fuelled by the promise of post-pandemic reconnection.",
      "\"What we found was we had each other,\" says Koleoso. \"It felt like we were meant to be together, and we made as many tracks as we could that articulate that.\"",
      "When it won the Mercury Prize, the follow-up was already in the bag.",
      "Dance, No-One's Watching was recorded over three days (\"one was just setting up\") at Abbey Road Studios, with the band still slightly worse-for-wear after a weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival.",
      "The idea was to capture the excitement of their live show direct to tape \u2013 with an audience of family and friends to stop them obsessing over the technicalities of recording.",
      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",
      "\"Those things are precious, because they will never happen again.",
      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",
      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",
      "\"This was at the height of grime and funky house, so I'm just having the best time in my life, dancing on this boat in a suit\u2026 then I missed the last tube home.\"",
      "In a time before Google Maps, it took a while to locate the right bus. When he finally clambered on board, it was carnage.",
      "\"I grew 10 years in that one journey, do you know what I mean?\" he laughs. \"I saw waaaay to much life!\"",
      "His desire to document life in all its messy, wonderful glory is the album's core.",
      "\"In 2022, we got to travel the whole world. We had amazing nights in New Orleans, on colourful streets with so much going on that it's hard to describe.",
      "\"And you'd think, 'How do I get this feeling into a song? I want someone in their flat in Edmonton to get a glimpse of this.'",
      "\"Or you'd go to the shrine in Lagos and be like, 'I need to convey the feeling of the shrine to someone who lives in Cardiff.'\"",
      "Ezra Collective's ever-growing audience suggests they've successfully completed that mission.",

      "\"I was pretty embarrassed, because it made difficult to convince my parents that playing music was gonna be OK.",
      "\"But what it tells you is that exams can determine one type of intelligence, but they're not the be-all and end-all.",
      "\"If there was an exam in shutting down shows, I think I'd do better than a D.\"",

      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",

      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",

      "\"Can that chap sit, do we think?\" asks Dr Raj Paw, a senior consultant in the emergency department at Warwick Hospital.",
      "He is speaking about a patient in his 90s  who was brought in after collapsing at home, where he was found cold and confused.",
      "Now he is stable. Could that open up a bed?",
      "\"If we can get him to sit then he could go into one of the chairs, and that would free up his bed,\" Dr Paw says.",
      "This is the sort of conversation doctors and nurses are having in hospitals up and down the country as a severe flu season puts the NHS under pressure.",
      "More than a dozen hospitals have declared critical incidents - including some of those considered among the best in the country.",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC visited Warwick Hospital. It is run by the South Warwickshire trust, which is one of the top rated in the country and has prided itself on the smooth running of its four hospitals.",
      "But the caseload has been overwhelming this week.",
      "Warwick Hospital has 375 beds and at one point the predicted demand was almost 100 more than that. For the first time ever, it's had to declare a critical incident - the highest alert level in the NHS.",
      "The BBC was there when hospital administrators made the call. Declaring a critical incident is a warning to the local health system that things are getting bad. Often, it frees up hospitals to redeploy doctors and create new temporary ward space.",
      "Over a two-day period, the BBC saw doctors and nurses doing just that: finding stop-gap solutions to treat patients in whatever safe settings could be established.",
      "With emergency departments overflowing, sick people need to be treated in the chairs they're sitting in.",
      "Others have had to wait in ambulances parked outside emergency units for hours before they could even be taken inside.",
      "One such patient is Percy, who is in his 80s and experiencing liver failure. He came to hospital because he had been feeling sick and had lost weight over recent weeks.",
      "Dr Arun Jeyakumar, a senior registrar on the ward, is one of the doctors sent out to check on patients like Percy.",
      "Hopping into the ambulance, he has a brief consultation with him. He tells Percy that everything is being done to get him into the hospital.",
      "Percy smiles back weakly, resigned to the wait.",
      "The paramedic who brought him to the hospital is also resigned: he's seen plenty of cases like Percy's this season.",
      "He turns up the heating in the back of the ambulance and sits down again as Dr Jeyakumar hops out and closes the doors.",
      "Back in the emergency department, doctors, nurses and consultants discuss how to make space for new arrivals.",
      "Beds are at an absolute premium in the hospital. So many patients have arrived that a room near the ambulance entrance has been set up for people considered \"fit to sit\".",
      "Every chair is occupied.",
      "\"It isn't ideal,\" one doctor says. \"But it is safe.\"",
      "Porters have to wheel beds through this open space, between patients being treated in chairs and nurses kneeling on the floor to remove cannulas. Drip stands are shuffled back and forth to make room.",
      "We see a nurse taking a patient, who is still attached to a drip, to the loo in a wheelchair.",
      "She leaves the chair in the corridor and helps the patient in. A porter comes and goes to move the vacant wheelchair.",
      "The nurse dashes back out. \"That's my wheelchair,\" she cries.",
      "We roll it back to her and she starts to laugh. \"You can't take your eye off them for a second or another patient will be in it,\" she says - only half joking.",
      "Elsewhere, Percy makes it from the ambulance to the emergency department, after a three hour wait.",
      "\"It's getting worse,\" he says, wincing as he closes his eyes - but it will be another 12 hours before Percy is admitted to a ward.",
      "When we see him finally being moved, he is contorted in his bed from the pain, clutching onto a sick bowl.",
      "Dr Paw's first job during his rounds is to check the cubicles to see who he can move off beds.",
      "He has a full waiting room just beyond the doors and four ambulances banked up outside.",
      "A woman in the last cubicle he visits is crying. Dr Paw receives an update from a nurse on her condition and orders some morphine.",
      "\"You're in the right place,\" he tells the patient. \"We'll sort out your pain.\"",
      "Dr Paw tells us: \"The people that come in now are sicker than they used to be. And here we are, trying to get them out quicker.\"",
      "He then moves on to a man who was admitted for a heart attack two days ago but is no longer receiving active treatment. Can he safely be moved, Dr Paw wonders.",
      "\"These are the decisions we're being forced to make,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I'm considering moving a heart attack patient to the waiting room so I can have his cubicle.\"",
      "Another patient Dr Paw saw the previous day is still waiting for a bed in the ward more than 24 hours later.",
      "\"It's rubbish. It's not what should happen,\" Dr Paw says. \"People shouldn't be spending 27, 28 hours in an emergency department.\"",
      "At one point during our time at the hospital we were taken to a bank of screens displaying statistics.",
      "It showed that patients in the emergency department were waiting nearly 30 hours for a bed and there were six ambulances queued up outside. One had been there for four hours.",
      "\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" one doctor says.",
      "South Warwickshire Trust stood down the critical incident on Thursday \u2013 it had been in place for 48 hours. Staff told the BBC though that the pressures on the hospital were still intense."

      "She was seen at the clinic by Sean Scott. Posts on social media pages for Reshape U and Faces by Sean at the time referred to him as Dr Sean Scott, Clinical Director. Videos posted by the same accounts in January and April 2023 show a plaque on his door in the clinic saying Dr Sean Scott, hPhd, Clinical Director.",
      "However, the BBC has discovered Mr Scott is not medically trained. He said he \"naively and regretfully\" bought an honorary doctorate in business consultancy online and displayed the certificate in his clinic.",
      "He says he did not portray himself as a medical doctor and claimed he informed clients who asked that he was not medically qualified. He says he stopped using the fake title on advice from Hull City Council (HCC) in 2024, with the authority telling him it was \"misleading\".",
      "Andrea claims Mr Scott gave her antibiotics to take after her first breast filler procedure in December 2021. She says he gave her antibiotics again when she returned the following month for a second breast filler procedure.",

      "Andrea had filler in her cheeks, chin and jaw but says her face started swelling and dark marks appeared. From there, she says the supposedly \"simple procedure\" turned into a catalogue of botched treatments.",
      "Andrea claims Mr Scott told her the swellings were caused by an insect bite and says she was encouraged to have further treatments.",
      "Mr Scott strongly denies the allegations, adding: \"Never once did we perform any treatments while the client was showing any signs of swelling, bruising or any other side effect.\"",
      "He said the only complaints Andrea initially made were that she \"wasn't quite happy\" with the treatments, and that was the reason she had \"so many\" follow-up appointments.",
      "Mr Scott also claimed Andrea had visited other clinics for treatment during this period, including one which damaged her skin, and that his clinic treated this damage. Andrea says she only had one dermal filler treatment elsewhere, which she was happy with, three years before visiting Mr Scott.",

      "\"If the government said 'we want this in in six months', it could be done,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 15:52:40 GMT",
    "summary": "An outbreak of the flu-like virus in China is causing concern, but experts say a Covid-like pandemic is unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",
      "It is usually almost indistinguishable from flu.",
      "Symptoms for most people include a cough, a fever and blocked nose.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus.",
      "It also poses a greater risk to those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, according to Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases specialist in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" of immunocompromised people can develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "Many other countries in the northern hemisphere - including the US - are also experiencing a growth in rates of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring rates of flu-like illness across the Northern hemisphere, and said it has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns in China or elsewhere.",
      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",
      "Is HMPV spreading in the UK?",
      "The incidence of HMPV in the UK has risen steadily since October 2024.",
      "The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA)  does not publish the number of cases recorded.",
      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",
      "\"I don't think there are currently any signs of a more serious global issue.\"",
      "However, health officials recommend taking sensible precautions to avoid catching HMPV and other respiratory illnesses:",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "Listen to this article",
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

    "summary": "Peter Kyle responds as internet safety campaigner Ian Russell says laws to protect children need fixing.",
    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",
      "Ministers are not ruling out further legislation but wanted \"to be agile and quick\" to keep up with fast-moving trends, a source said.",
      "How can you keep children safe online?",
      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers",
      "In his letter, Ian Russell argued that \"ominous\" changes in the tech industry put greater pressure on the government to act.",
      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is \"no real movement\" within government on online safety.",
    "story": [
      "The father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after seeing harmful content online, has personally appealed to the prime minister to tighten rules that protect children and has warned the UK is \"going backwards\" on internet safety.",
      "Ian Russell, who backed the previous government bringing in new requirements for tech firms in the Online Safety Act, calls the way the regulator Ofcom is implementing the rules a \"disaster\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday, seen by the BBC, Mr Russell says there is \"widespread dismay\" among bereaved families who have fought for tougher protections, and that more young people have lost their lives because of \"dither and delay\".",
      "And he warns that without tougher actions, \"the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model\".",
      "\"This preventable harm would be happening on your watch,\" he writes to Sir Keir.",
      "The Online Safety Act, introduced last year, is designed to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and protect children from some legal-but-harmful material. Ofcom decides the specific guidelines that companies must follow.",
      "Safety campaigners believe there are significant loopholes in Ofcom's code on illegal content, including a lack of specific rules on live streaming or content that promotes suicide and self-harm. And the new codes of practice, which are still being worked on, won't apply to private messaging.",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We recognise the profound pain caused by harmful content online, and our deepest sympathies remain with Ian Russell and all those who have suffered unimaginable loss.\" They said the voices of victims \"will continue to be at the heart of our work\".",
      "The spokesperson added that tech firms are required to assess the risks of illegal harms on their platforms by 16 March, and after that companies would need measures to reduce the risk of illegal content appearing and to remove it quickly when it appears.",
      "\"In the coming months, as our enforcement powers commence, platforms will face further obligations to protect children from harmful content, even where it is not illegal,\" they said.",

      "In his letter, Mr Russell also says Elon Musk, who is the boss of X, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".",
      "\"In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most,\" he writes.",
      "And in an exclusive interview, Mr Russell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were turning \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to and therefore more children will be exposed to in the future\".",
      "\"And by turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money,\" he said. Zuckerberg announced this week that Meta was abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and that the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "\"We want young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps - this has not changed,\" they said.",
      "Mr Russell called on the government to both bolster the Online Safety Act and to introduce extra legislation designed to tackle what he describes as \"the reckless behaviours of social media leadership\".",
      "He also said that he thought there was \"no real movement\" within government. \"The online safety push has stagnated,\" he said. \"In fact, we're probably heading backwards because the tech platforms have changed the way they're playing the game.\"",
      "He said he was sure Sir Keir \"is a father who protects his children from online dangers as much as any individual can\".",
      "\"But as a prime minister, he needs to really back online safety and move forward so that the UK is the safest place in the world to be online,\" he added.",

We are grateful for all their contributions and will continue to work with them to get this right.",
      "\"This government is committed to ensuring online safety for children. Social media platforms must step up to their responsibilities and take robust action to protect children from seeing harmful content on their sites.\"",
      "Mr Russell's daughter Molly took her own life in November 2017 after being exposed to a stream of dark, depressing content on Pinterest and Instagram. He has been campaigning for online safety measures since his daughter's death.",
      "You can read his letter in full at the bottom of this story.",
      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",
      "The Online Safety Act weathered many controversies and took years to put together. On one side were campaigners concerned about providing protection, on the other, fierce lobbying from the tech companies against straying into censorship or invading people's privacy.",
      "Ofcom was picked to police the rules and could theoretically be incredibly tough, threatening fines of millions of pounds or even prison for those companies that break them. But the new codes of practice are not yet fully in force.",
      "But campaigners like Mr Russell believe it's already obvious the rules fall short. The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online. But the government is also nervous about making rules so tight that tech companies feel unwelcome.",
      "This weekend we'll be joined by the Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who is determined to make the UK a good place for big tech companies to do business, to help the economy grow. From Sunday onwards he will spell out how artificial intelligence can speed up government business and improve our public services \u2013 this government, like Rishi Sunak's, believes AI can boost the UK's sagging productivity.",
      "But the advance of those technologies bring risks, and tricky decisions for ministers.",
      "Warnings that advanced AI could wipe out thousands of jobs; concerns over deepfake video in pornography, child abuse, or misinformation. Even Paul McCartney and Kate Bush have got the government in their sights as they campaign to try to protect artists' work being used without payment by giant AI platforms, upending decades of copyright law.",
      "Multiple sources familiar with government discussions on child safety and other aspects of this massive quandary say they are concerned the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) is not paying enough attention to the possible downsides.",
      "A government source said some discussions about protecting people online had been \"spicy\". \"This is a form of harm. It's normal for departments like Home Office and Department of Health to be constantly reviewing what's going on to keep up with safety \u2013 [DSIT] is not yet used to having to doing the same.\"",
      "A source at DSIT said the department had already acknowledged there might have to be more legislation in future but highlighted the fact that the Ofcom codes aren't yet completed or in force.",
      "And a spokesperson said: \"Bereaved parents have suffered the most unimaginable loss, and we are prepared to use every lever at our disposal to improve online safety for children.",
      "\"Changes coming into force through the Online Safety Act will ensure platforms have to act to protect children from harmful online content, with Ofcom ready to enforce these new laws from March. They have our complete backing to use the full range of their powers to root harmful material from the internet, and we expect platforms to be acting now to prepare for these changes.\"",
      "These aren't new arguments. But Musk's trolling of the UK government and Zuckerberg's flex away from fact checking have shifted the ground on which the conversations are taking place.",
      "Ministers have to consider what's right for the economy as well as protecting the public. And they might not want to admit it, but no politician wants to pick a fight with billionaires with massive social media megaphones - or indeed be seen to curtail our liberties or privacy without good reason. Arguably that is why measures like the Online Safety Act took so long to introduce in the first place.",
      "The palpable fear from campaigners like Mr Russell is that just as technology has been speeding up, hard-fought moves to put safety first have been slowing down.",

      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

    "summary": "Why Rachel Reeves needs a more detailed growth strategy - and soon.",
    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending.

    "story": [
      "A cabinet minister has rejected a call from Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, while leaving the door open for a future investigation.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she disagreed with Burnham's support for a fresh inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in areas including Oldham and Rochdale, in Greater Manchester.",
      "The Conservatives and Reform UK have both backed calls from tech billionaire Elon Musk for a new national investigation.",
      "But Labour ministers have said their priority is to implement the 2022 recommendations of a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse.",
      "Burnham backs 'limited' national abuse inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Musk's 'disinformation' endangering me, says Phillips",
      "On Wednesday, MPs voted against a Tory move to force a fresh national investigation.",
      "Burnham told BBC Radio Manchester he thought there was a case for a \"limited national inquiry that draws on reviews like the one that I commissioned, and the one we have seen in Rotherham, the one we have seen in Telford, to draw out some of these national issues and compel people to give evidence, who then may have charges to answer and be held to account\".",
      "Asked about this on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Nandy, MP for Wigan in Greater Manchester, said: \"I get the point that Andy's making.\"",
      "She said he was calling for a smaller inquiry into specific issues that the one he had instigated could not pick up.",
      "The culture secretary described it as \"astonishing\" that some Greater Manchester Police officers had refused to take part in that local inquiry and could not be compelled to do so.",
      "But, she added, she did not agree with Burnham, because the Jay inquiry, set up by Theresa May's government, had taken evidence from thousands of victims and addressed the issues he had raised.",
      "\"That inquiry found what every inquiry has found, that young girls weren't believed because they were young, they were female, and they were working-class, and that the systems that were supposed to protect them protected themselves instead of protecting those brave young victims,\" Nandy said.",
      "She denied the government was \"cross\" with Burnham, saying the whole point of devolution was \"that we want to make sure that people's views are heard from across the country\".",
      "Asked whether the government was ruling out another inquiry, Ms Nandy said: \"The reason I think that people have heard from us that there may at some point in the future be another inquiry is because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard.\"",
      "On Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would begin implementing Prof Jay's call for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse, with further details to be set out in the coming weeks.",

      "The Tories accused Labour MPs of having \"turned a blind eye to justice\" for victims of grooming gangs.",
      "The bill, which includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies, would have been killed off if MPs had voted through the Tory amendment.",
      "Burnham said that while he supported a limited, new inquiry, MPs were right to vote down Conservative \"opportunism\".",

      "But Nandy said she had spoken to survivors who had given evidence to the Jay inquiry and had begun to lose faith in the process leading to concrete action.",
      "\"We can not possibly ask victims to go through that again when not one single one of those recommendations has been implemented.",
      "\"Our message to victims is we understand the time for action is long overdue and we are acting. The time for talking is over, the time for action is now,\" she said.",

      "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.",
      "Centrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.",

      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",
      "Wholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.",

      "As well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.",
      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",

      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",

He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"",
      "She added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"",
      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",
      "\"The call for evidence will seek views on how the ticketing system in the live events sector is working for fans and whether the current system provides sufficient protection from unfair practices,\" the governments aid.",

      "Ticket resale sites have previously defended their services, with Viagogo saying its site ensures resales are \"a secure, safe transaction\".",

      "Viagogo boss defends resold Taylor Swift tickets",
      "Meanwhile, Ticketmaster said it would support a cap on the reselling of tickets.",

      "\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap. We also urge the government to crack down on bots and ban speculative ticket sales.\"",
      "Sarah Cardell, CEO of CMA, added: \"We know from our own work on ticket reselling that fans often have to jump through hoops and can be left out of pocket or turned away at the door.",
      "\"That is why we made recommendations to the previous government to tackle illegal bulk-buying, stop speculative selling and hold platforms accountable for inaccurate ticket information.\"",
      "She said they \"welcome this fresh opportunity to bring in the stronger protections consumers need in this area\".",

      "It pointed to other countries - such as Ireland which banned ticket touting in 2021 - saying it shows \"how legislation to prevent the resale of tickets for profit can massively curb the illegal and anti-consumer practices of online ticket touts and offshore resale platforms. The UK simply needs to follow their example\"."

      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",

    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",

      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",

      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "story": [
      "The new year in politics starts with the bang of a billionaire with a bigger mouth than his bank balance.",
      "Elon Musk has been lobbing almost as many digital darts over the Atlantic as Luke Littler has the real things in the last couple of days.",
      "The world's richest man has been sounding off in the strongest possible terms about the prime minister for almost as long as Sir Keir Starmer has been in Downing Street.",
      "In recent days, the focus has been on child sexual exploitation and Musk's allegation that the prime minister was \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" when he was Director of Public Prosecutions by failing to deal with the scandal.",
      "I'm told Sir Keir \"will not want to get into a food fight with Musk\" but will make a robust defence of his time as chief prosecutor.",
      "He is also keen to emphasise the importance of political debate being grounded in verifiable facts and that Musk is making claims that are \"blatantly untrue\" as one source put it.",
      "Sources point, for instance, to those defending the Prime Minister's record as DPP, including another former senior prosecutor who took to X - the social media platform Musk owns - to say Sir Keir oversaw a record number of child abuse convictions.",
      "Those in government also point to the local inquiries there have been into the abuse and rape of vulnerable young girls by groups of men mainly of Pakistani descent \u2013 and the national inquiry conducted by Professor Alexis Jay.",
      "The Conservatives, Reform and Elon Musk have each expressed varying degrees of outrage in recent days that the government has said no to a public inquiry into the scandal.",
      "But few expected this weekend's twist: that within hours of the Reform leader Nigel Farage describing Musk as a \"hero\" who \"makes us look cool,\" the X owner said Reform needed a new leader as Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\".",
      "\"It's not been the perfect day,\" said one Reform figure with a splash of understatement and a smile. \"We probably do look a bit silly.\"",
      "Farage's repeated statements distancing himself from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, appear to be at the heart of the spat.",
      "Reform hadn't seen this coming. Just weeks ago they were talking up the prospect of a big money donation from Elon Musk \u2013 but are now trying to put the best spin on things.",
      "\"Nigel is not for sale,\" is how one senior party figure put it to me, saying this showed that the Reform leader was willing to stand up to anybody, including the richest man in the world.",
      "Another said that if Reform were to be treated as a serious political outfit - and remember, Nigel Farage has said he wants to win the next general election - that means robustly and consistently rejecting any association with Robinson, whatever the consequences.",
      "The one politician to attract some praise from Elon Musk, for now at least, is the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, for her calls for a public inquiry into child sexual abuse.",
      "Badenoch sees the scandal as a case study in what she sees as our broken politics.",
      "For Badenoch, 2025 will be a crucial year as she fights to rebuild her party and fights for attention \u2013 not easy, when Nigel Farage is around.",
      "She got yet another taste of that over Christmas in a very public row with him over party membership numbers: Badenoch suggested Reform's claim on Boxing Day to have overtaken the Tories' membership numbers were \"fake\" as their tally was automatically rising.",
      "Reform invited journalists to verify that this was not the case and the Financial Times among others concluded there was \"strong evidence\" the party's tally was accurate.",
      "In the coming weeks, we can expect to hear from Badenoch about the so-called Policy Commissions she is setting up, and who will lead them.",
      "It will be worth keeping an eye too on the man she beat to the leadership, Robert Jenrick, who hasn't exactly gone quietly.",
      "He is her shadow justice secretary but his willingness to carry on campaigning almost as if the leadership race was still on is irking some senior Tories, who want him to stay in his lane on policy and not stray all over the place talking about whatever he likes.",
      "As for the prime minister, a bruising first six months into office and with noises off at home and abroad, his big hope is delivery.",
      "He is forgoing the usual new year big picture speech as his team feel he did just that with his big speech last month.",
      "Instead, he is focusing on a specific promise: getting hospital waiting lists down in England.",
      "He will do similar style events and visits in the coming weeks on the government's other big promises.",
      "So here goes with politics in 2025.",
      "We are not even a week in and it is proving lively already.",

    "summary": "Last year was the world's warmest on record, bringing temperatures above a politically symbolic milestone.",
    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

      "But such was the object's fame that Mukuku villagers feared it would be stolen overnight.",
      "Together with local officers, some of them took it in turns to stand guard, lighting a fire nearby. They wanted to keep away potential scrap dealers and others wanting to make money out of the curiosity.",
      "It is said to weigh more than 500kg (1,102lb) - around the same as an adult horse - and is around 2.5m (8ft) in diameter, roughly the size of child's four-seater merry-go-round.",
      "With daylight came more onlookers on New Year's Eve - followed by the KSA team and the media.",

      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",

      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "summary": "Peter Kyle responds as internet safety campaigner Ian Russell says laws to protect children need fixing.",
    "story": [
      "UK laws on internet safety are \"very uneven\" and \"unsatisfactory\", Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said, following calls from campaigners to tighten the rules.",
      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",
      "Ministers are not ruling out further legislation but wanted \"to be agile and quick\" to keep up with fast-moving trends, a source said.",
      "How can you keep children safe online?",
      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers",
      "In his letter, Ian Russell argued that \"ominous\" changes in the tech industry put greater pressure on the government to act.",
      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "The Supreme Court appears poised to uphold a law that bans TikTok in the US over national security concerns unless its China-based parent company sells the platform ahead of a 19 January deadline.",
      "The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US.",
      "The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",
      "A decision by the top court has to be made within days. President-elect Donald Trump - who returns to the White House in just over a week - now argues against the ban.",
      "The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January. The company has said it will not sell the short-form video platform.",
      "Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people.",
      "The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.",
      "TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
      "Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship.",
      "He argued that  \"the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech\".",

      "But he said that under the First Amendment, mere ideas do not represent a national security threat.",
      "Justice department lawyer Elizabeth B Prelogar told  the court that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk.",

      "Ms Prelogar, arguing for the US justice department, said \"nothing permanent\" had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale.",
      "Forcing the app to go dark could be just the \"jolt\" ByteDance needs to seriously consider a sale, she said.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,\" she said, comparing the situation to \"game of chicken\" and one in which the US should not \"blink first\".",
      "After the hearing, legal observers predicted that the Supreme Court's justices appeared to be swayed by the government's concerns.",

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "He was looking for his cast-iron pans in the hope they might have survived the blaze, one of several historic fires burning in the area that have killed at least 16 people and decimated multiple communities and left thousands homeless.",
      "Across the street - at number 296 - his friend Rachel's house also sits in ashes. The house next door - 281 - where he'd enjoyed family parties, is gone.",
      "About three blocks away, on Devirian Place, where his girlfriend lived, some neighbours tried to fend off the roaring flames that would consume their homes with garden hoses.",
      "Now they, too, are searching for treasured items in the rubble, after fire obliterated this entire community nestled in the shadow of the San Gabriel Mountains.",
      "It all started on Tuesday night.",
      "The Santa Ana winds had been fierce much of the day.",
      "Daron was in his front yard just after 18:00 local time trying to secure items from flying away.",
      "At the time, it was only wind that concerned him.",
      "He had no idea that one of the two worst wildfires in LA history had just ignited a few miles away, part of a days-long nightmare that at its peak would see six blazes simultaneously threatening America's second-largest city",
      "The Eaton fire that tore through Altadena has now ravaged more than 14,000 acres, destroying thousands of homes and businesses, and left 11 dead. By the weekend, Eaton remained only 15% contained.",
      "In west LA, the Palisades fire, which had started that morning, would go on to burn through more than 23,000 acres, reducing much of a vibrant community to ash, and killing at least five people.",
      "Daron's next-door neighbour at house 281, Dillon Akers, was at work at a donut stand in the Topanga mall - about 40 miles away - as smoke started filling their neighbourhood.",
      "The 20-year-old rushed back when he heard the news, only to find his corner of north-west Altadena pitch black and members of his family frantically evacuating their home.",
      "His uncle leapt over their white picket fence to save precious seconds as he stuffed items into the back of his car.",
      "For the next two hours, Dillon did the same, gathering food, medicine, clothes and toiletries. In the rush, he mislaid his keys, and lost 30 minutes searching in the smoky dark with torches until he found them blown against a fence.",
      "During the desperate search, he kept telling himself that local authorities would be able to handle the fire that was roaring down the mountain towards the home he shared with his mother, grandmother, aunt and two younger cousins.",
      "Dillon had faced windstorms before, and had seen smoke in the mountains, but this time felt different. This time the orange glow in the sky was directly overhead.",
      "\"I was fully at a 10 on the scale of scared,\" he said.",
      "At 00:30 Wednesday, Dillon said that he and his mother were the last people to leave West Las Flores Drive. They may have been the last to get out alive.",
      "The following day authorities would announce that the remains of a neighbour down the road had been discovered.",
      "Rachel and Daron had left the neighbourhood about two hours before Dillon. Rachel was forced out by a friend who drove over to demand: \"You've got to leave now.\"",
      "Rachel - with her wife, toddler, five cats, and two days of clothing - said goodbye to the home they had bought just one year earlier.",
      "Daron also grabbed what he could: a guitar he purchased when he was 14 with money he earned working as an extra in a karate film and a painting of his family crossing Abbey Road in London, made to look like the cover of the iconic Beatles album.",
      "As those on Las Flores Drive evacuated, Daron's neighbours a few blocks away tried to fight the flames.",
      "At 417 Devirian Place, Hipolito Cisneros and his close friend and neighbour Larry Villescas, who lived across the street at home number 416, grabbed garden hoses.",
      "The scene outside looked hellish.",
      "The garage of one home was in flames. A car in front of another, too.",
      "They stretched hoses out from multiple homes and doused the structures with water - including the house of Daron's girlfriend, Sachi.",
      "\"The water was just repelling off. It wasn't even penetrating or nothing,\" Hipolito said, referring to the bone-dry earth and brush around the homes.",
      "Over time, they made progress, hosing off embers and spot fires. Larry thought they might be winning.",
      "Then their hoses ran dry - all due to water pressure issues they'd later learn had hampered firefighting efforts across Los Angeles County amid intense demand.",
      "An explosion sounded nearby, another home bursting into flames. By 01:00, both of their families were packing to leave.",
      "\"We tried. We really tried,\" Hipolito said.",
      "By 02:30 Wednesday morning, police cars rolled down their street with a loudspeaker, telling everyone to leave immediately.",
      "As he turned the corner of his street, Larry watched in his truck's rear-view mirror as his garage caught fire.",
      "By 03:00, the street was empty.",
      "Much of the Los Angeles region is made up of neighbourhoods and small communities just like Altadena.",
      "On any given morning, people would walk through the lines of homes to get a cup of coffee at The Little Red Hen Coffee Shop, stopping to catch up while leaving for work in the morning.",
      "Many have described decades of tight-knit community here, where they watched neighbours start families and the children who once played in the streets grow up.",
      "But driving through the area for the first time since his world was upended, Daron barely recognises his neighbourhood.",
      "The big blue house that marked one familiar turn is gone.  All of the landmarks that once guided him have vanished. He points out each neighbour's property, gasping as he realises that none are standing.",
      "He takes photos of his and Rachel's home and the street he shares with Dillon. Outside his girlfriend's home - which Larry and Hipolito tried to save - he takes videos and chats with their families before calling Sachi to describe the state of her home.",
      "\"God, everything is gone,\" he says, his voice cracking.",
      "But a few items remain amidst the ruins.",
      "At his sister's home back on West Las Flores Drive, he finds multi-coloured plastic lawn ornaments stuck in her lawn, somehow untouched by fire.",
      "He plucks each stake from the ground, knowing that while these flower decorations might feel insignificant amid the devastation, they also might make her smile.",
      "Across the street at what was once his house, a red-brick chimney is all that is left standing. Around it is a pile of clay pottery.",
      "With his hands dark black from the soot, he collects what he can, but many pieces disintegrate with his touch.",
      "A scorched lemon tree sits in the lawn, some fruit still warm to the touch.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Young male gamers in South Korea thought it resembled a gesture used to poke fun at the size of men\u2019s penises.",
    "story": [
      "It was late at night, and Darim's animation studio had just finished designing a new look for a character in one of South Korea's most popular video games, MapleStory.",
      "Darim was proud of her work. So, sitting alone on the floor of her small studio apartment, she posted the trailer on social media. Almost immediately, she was flooded with thousands of abusive messages, including death and rape threats.",
      "Young male gamers had taken issue with a single frame in the trailer, in which the female character could be seen holding her thumb and forefinger close together.",
      "They thought it resembled a hand gesture used by a radical online feminist community almost a decade ago to poke fun at the size of Korean men's penises.",
      "\"There were insults I'd never heard before, they were disgusting and inhumane,\" said Darim, which is not her real name. One read: \"You've just sabotaged your job.\"",
      "Messages then started piling into Darim's studio and the game developer claiming she was a feminist and demanding she be fired. Within hours, the company pulled the promotional video.",
      "Darim had become the latest victim in a series of vicious online witch hunts, in which men in South Korea attack women they suspect of having feminist views. They bombard them with abuse and try to get them sacked.",
      "This is part of a growing backlash to feminism, in which feminists have been branded man-haters who deserve to be punished. The witch hunts are having a chilling effect on women, with many now scared to admit they are feminists.",
      "This is forcing the movement underground, in a country where gender discrimination is still deeply entrenched. South Korea has the largest gender pay gap in the OECD, a group of the world's rich countries.",
      "The hunts are often spearheaded by young male video gamers, and target women who work in the industry, like Darim, though recently they have spread to other professions.",
      "They look for anything that resembles what they term the 'finger-pinching gesture' and use it as proof that men-hating women are surreptitiously mocking them.",
      "Once they spot a supposed sign, the hunt begins. \"They decide that a dark, evil feminist is hiding in the company, and her life should be ruined,\" explained Minsung Kim, a 22-year-old male gamer who, concerned by these witch hunts, set up an organisation to support the victims.",
      "The witch hunters track down all female employees at the company in question, and trawl their social media accounts, searching for any evidence of feminism. Way back on Darim's timeline, they found an 'offending' post.",
      "Darim in fact had nothing to do with the disputed part of the animation, but her studio was rattled by the torrent of abuse \u2013 especially after Nexon, the gaming company, suddenly removed all the studio's artwork from their roster and issued an apology to customers.",
      "\"My company and CEO were in a panic,\" said Darim. \"I thought I was going to be fired, and I'd never be able to work in animation again.\"",
      "Then Minsung's organisation stepped in. They urged her studio to ignore the gamers and offered to pay Darim's legal fees so she could report the abuse. \"We said these demands will never end, you need to nip this in the bud now,\" he said. The studio listened, and Darim kept her job.",
      "But similar witch hunts have worked, in the gaming industry and beyond, and they are becoming more frequent. In one case, a young illustrator lost her job after a handful of disgruntled gamers stormed the company's office demanding she be removed.",
      "And it is not just Korean companies that have capitulated. Last year, the international car maker Renault suspended one of its female employees after she was accused of making the finger-pinching gesture while moving her hands in a promotional presentation.",
      "\"These anti-feminists are getting more organised; their playbook is getting more specific,\" said Minsung. \"By taking a hand gesture that everyone makes and turning it into a scarlet letter they can brand literally anyone an evil feminist,\" he said.",
      "Because the companies are folding to these baseless accusations, the instigators of these hunts have become emboldened, he said. \"They are confident now that when you accuse someone of feminism, you can ruin their career.\"",
      "Minsung knows, because not long ago he was one of these men. He used to belong to the anti-feminist forums. \"We are exposed to the uncensored internet unimaginably young,\" he said, having joined the forums aged nine.",
      "It was only when Minsung traded video games for playing real-life games, including Dungeons and Dragons, that he met women, and his views shifted. He became, in his words, an \"ardent feminist\".",
      "In South Korea, women commonly suffer discrimination and misogyny both at work and at home. But as they have fought to improve their rights, many young men have started to believe they are the ones being discriminated against.",
      "The backlash began in the mid-2010s, following a surge of feminist activism. During this time, women took to the streets in protest at sexual violence and the widespread use of hidden cameras that secretly film women using toilets and changing rooms - around 5,000 to 6,000 cases are reported annually.",
      "\"Young men saw women becoming vocal and were threatened by their rise,\" said Myungji Yang, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, who has interviewed dozens of young Korean men. \"They learn about feminism from online forums, which carry the most radical caricature of feminists,\" she said. \"This has given them a distorted idea of what feminism is.\"",
      "One of their grievances is the 18-month military service men must complete. Once they leave the military they often \"feel entitled\" to a good job, said Hyun Mee Kim, a professor of cultural anthropology at Yonsei University in Seoul, who studies feminism.",
      "As more women have entered the workforce, and jobs have become harder to get, some men feel their opportunities are being unfairly taken away.",
      "These feelings have been validated by South Korea's now disgraced and suspended President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who came to power in 2022 on an anti-feminist platform, claiming gender discrimination no longer existed, and has since tried to dismantle the government's gender equality ministry.",
      "More surprising than these views themselves, is that the men who hold them have such power over major companies.",
      "Editing out fingers",
      "I travelled to Pangyo, the Silicon Valley of South Korea, to meet a woman who has worked in the gaming industry for 20 years. After Darim's case, her company started to edit all its games, removing the fingers from characters' hands, turning them into fists, to avoid complaints.",
      "\"It's exhausting and frustrating\" to work like this, she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"The idea that a hand gesture can be seen as an attack on men is absurd and companies should be ignoring it.\"",
      "When I asked why they were not, she told me that many developers share the gamers' anti-feminist views. \"For all those outside yelling, there are those on the inside who also believe things are bad.\"",
      "Then there is the financial cost. The men threaten to boycott the games unless the companies act.",
      "\"The gaming companies think the anti-feminists are the largest source of their revenue,\" said Minsung. After Darim's company, Studio Ppuri, was targeted, it said it lost nearly two thirds of its contracts with gaming companies.",
      "Studio Ppuri, did not respond to our questions, but both Nexon, the game developer, and Renault Korea told us they stood against all forms of discrimination and prejudice.",
      "There is evidence the authorities are also capitulating to the anti-feminists' demands. When Darim reported her abuse to the police, they refused to take her case.",
      "They said because the finger-pinching gesture was taboo, it was \"logical\" that she, as a feminist, had been attacked. \"I was astonished,\" she said. \"Why would the authorities not protect me?\"",
      "Following outrage from feminist organisations, the police backtracked and are now investigating. In a statement, Seocho district police told the BBC their initial decision to close the case had been \"insufficient\" and they were \"making all efforts to identify the suspects\".",
      "The case left Darim's lawyer, Yu-kyung Beom, dumbfounded. \"If you want to say that you're a feminist in South Korea, you have to be very brave or insane,\" she said.",
      "Beaten up for having short hair",
      "In November 2023, the violence spilled offline and into real life. A young woman, who we are calling Jigu, was working alone in a convenience store late at night, when a man walked in and started attacking her.",
      "\"He said 'hey, you're a feminist, right? You look like a feminist with your short hair',\" Jigu told me as she apprehensively recounted the night. The man pushed her to the ground and started kicking her. \"I kept going in and out of consciousness. I thought I could die.\"",
      "Jigu did not consider herself a feminist. She just liked having short hair and thought it suited her. The attack has left her with permanent injuries. Her left ear is damaged, and she wears a hearing aid.",
      "\"I feel like I've become a completely different person,\" she said. \"I don't smile as much. Some days it is agony just to stay alive, the memory of that day is still so clear.\"",
      "Her assailant was sent to prison for three years, and for the first time a South Korean court ruled this was a misogynistically motivated crime: in effect, that Jigu had been attacked for looking like a feminist.",
      "During the attack, the man said he belonged to an extreme anti-feminist group, New Men's Solidarity. Its leader, In-kyu Bae, has called on men to confront feminists. So, one evening, as he held a live-streaming event in Gangnam, a flashy neighbourhood in Seoul, I went to try to talk to him.",
      "\"I'm here to tell you these feminists are staining the country with hatred,\" he shouted from the roof of a black van kitted out with loudspeakers.",
      "\"That psychopath [who attacked Jigu] was not a member of our group. We don't have members, we are a YouTube channel,\" he told me as he simultaneously broadcast to thousands of subscribers. A small group of young men who had come to watch in person were cheering along.",
      "\"We've never encouraged anyone to use violence. In fact, the violent ones are the feminist groups. They're shaming men's genitals,\" he added.",
      "Last year, Mr Bae and several of his supporters were convicted of defaming and insulting a feminist activist after harassing her for more than two years.",
      "Anti-feminist views have become so widespread that Yuri Kim, the director of Korea Women's Trade Union, recently established a committee to track cases of what she describes as \"feminism censorship\". She found that some women have been questioned about their stance on feminism in job interviews, while at work women commonly face comments like \"all feminists need to die\".",
      "According to Prof Kim, the feminism academic, men are using now feminist threats in the office as a way to harass and control their female colleagues - it is their way of saying 'we are watching you; you should behave yourself'.",
      "Such harassment is proving effective. Last year, a pair of scholars coined the phrase \"quiet feminism\", to describe the impact of what they say is a \"pervasive everyday backlash\".",
      "Gowoon Jung and Minyoung Moon found that although women held feminist beliefs they did not feel safe disclosing them in public. Women I spoke to said they were even afraid to cut their hair short, while others said feminism had become so synonymous with hating men they did not associate with the cause.",
      "A 2024 IPSOS poll of 31 countries found only 24% of women in South Korea defined themselves as feminist, compared to an average of 45%, and down from 33% in 2019.",
      "Prof Kim worries the consequences will be severe. By being forced to conceal their feminist values, she argues women are being stripped of their ability to fight against gender inequality, which penetrates workplaces, politics and public life.",
      "Feminists are now busy brainstorming ways to put an end to the witch hunts. One clear answer is legal change. In South Korea there is no blanket anti-discrimination law to protect women and prevent them being fired for their views.",
      "It has been repeatedly blocked by politicians, largely because it would support gay and transgender people, with anti-feminists, and even some trans-exclusionary feminists, now lobbying against it.",
      "Minsung believes the only way to strip the witch hunters of their powers is for the companies and the authorities to stand up to them. They make up a small fraction of men in South Korea, they just have loud voices and a bizarrely oversized influence, he argues.",
      "Since her attack, Jigu now proudly calls herself a feminist. \"I want to reach out to other victims like me, and if even one woman has the strength to grab my hand, I want to help.\"",

      "\"We found a big piece of metal that was very red so we had to wait for it to cool before anyone could approach it,\" said Ann Kanuna, who told us she owns the land where the object fell.",
      "The giant ring took around two hours to cool down and turn grey \u2013 but it had already become a sensation with people arriving to look at it.",
      "The rest of that Monday afternoon - with few people working as it was the day before New Year's Eve - crowds came to view the giant metallic ring.",
      "It was like selfie central, with people coming to pose next to it and great debates about what it could be.",
      "The local authorities in Makueni county - which is around 115km (70 miles) south-east of the capital, Nairobi - were informed.",
      "The Kenya Space Agency (KSA) then heard about it and made arrangements to come and investigate the next day.",
      "But such was the object's fame that Mukuku villagers feared it would be stolen overnight.",
      "Together with local officers, some of them took it in turns to stand guard, lighting a fire nearby. They wanted to keep away potential scrap dealers and others wanting to make money out of the curiosity.",
      "It is said to weigh more than 500kg (1,102lb) - around the same as an adult horse - and is around 2.5m (8ft) in diameter, roughly the size of child's four-seater merry-go-round.",
      "With daylight came more onlookers on New Year's Eve - followed by the KSA team and the media.",
      "Mukuku had never seen such activity. When the object was carted away later that day by the KSA, the buzz gave way to concerns about what the villagers had had in their midst.",
      "The KSA said its preliminary assessments indicated the object was \"a separation ring\" from a space launch rocket.",
      "\"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans,\" its statement said the next day.",
      "No-one was injured when it had fallen but some in Mukuku began to complain that the impact of the crash had caused damage to nearby houses.",
      "Christine Kionga, who lives about a kilometre from the crash site, showed us cracks in the concrete of some of the buildings in her home compound. She said they had appeared after the crash.",
      "Other neighbours alleged the structural integrity of their homes had also been affected - allegations that are yet to be substantiated.",
      "\"The government needs to find the owners of this object, and get compensation for those affected by it,\" Mukuku resident Benson Mutuku told the BBC.",
      "There were reports in the local media that some residents had begun to complain of feeling unwell after exposure to the metallic ring though there was no confirmation from those we spoke to when we visited - nor from the authorities or the KSA.",
      "Nonetheless Mr Mutuku said there were concerns about the long-term effects of possible space radiation.",
      "\"This is a space object and we have heard in other similar incidents that there have been effects of radiation affecting even future generations and there is that fear in this community.\"",
      "However tests run later by the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority revealed that while the metal ring did have higher radiation levels than the area in which it was found, they were not at a level harmful to humans.",
      "Engineers from the KSA, which was established in 2017 to promote, co-ordinate and regulate space-related activities in the East African nation, are continuing to run other tests to find out more about the object.",
      "The KSA director general said it was lucky that no significant damage was done when the object hurtled to Earth.",
      "\"The ultimate responsibility for any damage or injury caused by that space object is on the state in whose jurisdiction that operator may have launched the object,\" Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey told the BBC.",
      "According to the Outer Space Treaty, overseen by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, \"states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects\".",
      "\"[The ring] is a common item in many rockets and many space objects so it difficult to attribute it to a specific rocket or space object but we have leads but as I said our investigations are not conclusive,\" Brigadier Kipkosgey said.",
      "The BBC showed pictures of the object to the UK Space Agency to get the thoughts of its experts.",
      "\"The most plausible object it could be is the upper stage separation ring from an Ariane rocket in 2008,\" its launch director, Matt Archer, said.",
      "\"The satellites are fine, but the actual rocket body has come through and de-orbited.\"",
      "The Ariane was Europe's main rocket launch vehicle, helping more than 230 satellites into orbit, before it was retired in 2023.",
      "It seems the separation ring may have been orbiting Earth for 16 years before making its unexpected appearance in Mukuku.",
      "This is not the first incident of space junk appearing in East Africa.",
      "Just over a year and a half ago some suspected space debris fell over several villages in western Uganda.",
      "And a few days ago, on 8 January, there were unconfirmed reports of what was believed to be space debris burning brightly in the skies above northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia.",
      "As the space industry grows, it is predicted that such incidents will become more frequent - and African governments may need to invest in ways to better detect this speeding space rubbish.",
      "Nasa estimates there are more than 6,000 tonnes of space debris in orbit at the moment.",
      "There are many different estimates about the chances of such junk hitting someone, but most are in the one-in-10,000 range.",
      "Such statistics are little comfort for Mukuku's residents, who cannot help thinking of what damage the ring could have caused had it landed in the centre of the village instead of on farmland.",

      "German authorities have said an oil tanker stuck in German waters belongs to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", which Berlin says is used to avoid sanctions.",
      "Germany's maritime authorities (CCME) said on Friday that the Panamanian-flagged ship, known as Eventin, had lost power and steering, meaning tugboats were deployed to secure the vessel.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock blamed Moscow, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of \"circumventing\" sanctions and threatening European security by \"ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers\".",
      "Russia, which previously declined to respond to accusations that it uses a shadow fleet, has not yet commented on this incident.",
      "The US, UK and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia's oil industry following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "In its first report of the tanker drifting in German waters, the CCME said the vessel was 274m (898ft) long and 48m (157ft) wide, carrying about 99,000 tonnes of oil.",

      "\"Russia is endangering our European security not only with its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but also with severed cables, displaced border buoys, disinformation campaigns, GPS jammers and, as we have seen, dilapidated oil tankers,\" the German foreign minister said in a statement.",

      "\"It all started as a small passion project,\" says Fabriccio D\u00edaz, 28, who, together with his wife Luc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City.",
      "\"Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,\" he adds.",
      "Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6.",
      "Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film.",
      "\"When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,\" Luc\u00eda recalls.",
      "And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala.",
      "The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips.",
      "\"We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise \"photo walks\" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras.",
      "For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iv\u00e1n Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with.",
      "\"It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Iv\u00e1n says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. \"They just don't understand our perspective,\" he explains.",
      "\"We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,\" he adds.",
      "Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven L\u00f3pez from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography.",
      "The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him.",
      "\"Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!\", he tells the BBC.",
      "The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places.",
      "\"It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,\" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed.",
      "And there are other hurdles, too.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal.",
      "\"Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,\" says Fabriccio.",
      "Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place.",
      "Luc\u00eda explains how sometimes clients \"put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back\".",
      "\"It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,\" she adds.",
      "Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, the process is very much \"hands-on\".",
      "For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly.",
      "\"The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,\" recalls Fabriccio.",
      "\"But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,\" he adds.",
      "Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process.",
      "The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house.",
      "There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America.",
      "Fabriccio and Luc\u00eda have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls.",
      "The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2.",

      "Fifty men who Dominique Pelicot recruited online to come rape and sexually assault his unconscious wife Gis\u00e8le were also sent to jail.",
      "He was caught by police after upskirting in a supermarket, leading investigators to look closer at him. On this seemingly innocuous retired grandfather's laptop and phones, they found thousands of videos and photos of his wife Gis\u00e8le, clearly unconscious, being raped by strangers.",
      "On top of pushing issues of rape and gender violence into the spotlight, the trial also highlighted the little-known issue of chemical submission - drug-facilitated assault.",
      "Caroline Darian has made it her life's struggle to fight chemical submission, which is thought to be under-reported as most victims have no recollection of the assaults and may not even realise they were drugged.",
      "In the days that followed Gis\u00e8le's fateful phone call, Caroline Darian and her brothers, Florian and David, travelled to the south of France where their parents had been living to support their mother as she absorbed the news that - as Ms Darian now puts it - her husband was \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 or 30 years\".",
      "Soon afterwards, Ms Darian herself was called in by police - and her world shattered again.",
      "She was shown two photos they found on her father's laptop. They showed an unconscious woman on a bed, wearing only a T-shirt and underwear.",
      "At first, she couldn't tell the woman was her. \"I lived a dissociation effect. I had difficulties recognising myself from the start,\" she says.",
      "\"Then the police officer said: 'Look, you have the same brown mark on your cheek... it's you.' I looked at those two photos differently then... I was laying on my left side like my mother, in all her pictures.\"",

      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France",
      "Who is Dominque Pelicot?",
      "Pelicot family torn apart",
      "Ms Darian says she is convinced her father abused and raped her too - something he has always denied, although he has offered conflicting explanations for the photos.",
      "\"I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence,\" she says.",
      "Unlike in the case of her mother, there is no proof of what Pelicot may have done to Ms Darian.",
      "\"And that's the case for how many victims? They are not believed because there's no evidence. They're not listened to, not supported,\" she says.",
      "Soon after her father's crimes came to light, Ms Darian wrote a book.",
      "I'll Never Call Him Dad Again explores her family's trauma.",
      "It also delves deeper into the issue of chemical submission, in which the drugs typically used \"come from the family's medicine cabinet\".",
      "\"Painkillers, sedatives. It's medication,\" Ms Darian says. As is the case for almost half of victims of chemical submission, she knew her abuser: the danger, she says, \"is coming from the inside.\"",
      "She says that in the midst of the trauma of finding out she had been raped more than 200 times by different people, her mother Gis\u00e8le found it difficult to accept that her husband may have also assaulted their daughter.",
      "\"For a mum it's difficult to integrate that all in one go,\" she says.",
      "Yet when Gis\u00e8le decided to open up the trial to the public and the media so as to expose what had been done to her by her husband and dozens of men, mother and daughter were in agreement: \"I knew we went through something... horrible, but that we had to go through it with dignity and strength.\"",
      "Now, Ms Darian needs to understand how to live knowing she is the daughter of both the torturer and the victim - something she calls \"a terrible burden\".",
      "She is now unable to think back to her childhood with the man she calls Dominique, only occasionally slipping back into the habit of referring to him as her father.",
      "\"When I look back I don't really remember the father that I thought he was. I look straight to the criminal, the sexual criminal he is,\" she says.",
      "\"But I have his DNA and the main reason why I am so engaged for invisible victims is also for me a way to put a real distance with this guy,\" she tells Emma Barnett. \"I am totally different from Dominique.\"",
      "Ms Darian adds she doesn't know whether her father was a \"monster,\" as some have called him. \"He knew perfectly well what he did, and he's not sick,\" she says.",
      "\"He is a dangerous man. There is no way he can get out. No way.\"",
      "It will be years before Dominique Pelicot, 72, is eligible for parole, so it is possible he will never see his family again.",
      "Meanwhile, the Pelicots are rebuilding themselves. Gis\u00e8le, Caroline Darian says, is exhausted from the trial, but also \"recovering... She is doing well\".",
      "As for Ms Darian, the only question she is interested in now is to raise awareness of chemical submission - and to educate children on sexual abuse.",
      "She derives strength from her husband, her brothers and her 10-year-old - her \"lovely son\", she says with a smile, her voice full of affection.",
      "The events that were unleashed on that November day made her who she is today, Ms Darian says. Now she is trying to look ahead.",

    "title": "A murder that shook British India and toppled a king",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:23:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A businessman was shot dead in India 100 years ago. Then, a sensational tale unfolded.",
    "story": [
      "It looked like an ordinary murder.",
      "One hundred years ago on this day - 12 January 1925 - a group of men attacked a couple on a car ride in a upmarket suburb in Bombay (now Mumbai) in colonial India, shooting the man dead and slashing the woman's face.",
      "But the story that unfolded brought global spotlight on the case, while its complexity put the country's then British rulers in a spot of bother, and eventually forced an Indian king to abdicate.",
      "Newspapers and magazines described the murder as \"perhaps the most sensational crime committed in British India\", and it became \"the talk of the city\" during the investigation and subsequent trial.",
      "The victim, Abdul Kadir Bawla, 25, was an influential textile businessman and the city's youngest municipal official. His female companion, Mumtaz Begum, 22, was a courtesan on the run from the harem of a princely state and had been staying with Bawla for the last few months.",
      "On the evening of the murder, Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were in the car with three others, driving in Malabar Hill, an affluent area along the shore of the Arabian Sea. Cars were a rarity in India at the time, and only the rich owned them.",
      "Suddenly, another car overtook them. Before they could react, it collided with theirs, forcing them to stop, according to intelligence and newspaper reports.",
      "The attackers showered expletives on Bawla and shouted \"get the lady out\", Mumtaz Begum later told the Bombay High Court.",
      "They then shot Bawla, who died a few hours later.",
      "A group of British soldiers, who had inadvertently taken a wrong turn on their way back from a golf game, heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene.",
      "They managed to catch one of the culprits, but one officer suffered gunshot wounds when an attacker opened fire at them.",
      "Before fleeing, the remaining attackers made two attempts to snatch the injured Mumtaz Begum from the British officers, who were trying to rush her to the hospital.",
      "The newspapers suggested that attackers' aim was likely abducting Mumtaz Begum, as Bawla - whom she had met while performing in Mumbai a few months earlier and had been living with since - had earlier received several threats for sheltering her.",
      "The Illustrated Weekly of India promised readers exclusive photographs of Mumtaz Begum, while the police planned to issue a daily bulletin to the press, Marathi newspaper Navakal reported.",
      "Even Bollywood found the case compelling enough to adapt it into a silent murder thriller within months.",
      "\"The case went beyond the usual murder mystery as it involved a rich and young tycoon, a slighted king, and a beautiful woman,\" says Dhaval Kulkarni, author of The Bawla Murder Case: Love, Lust and Crime in Colonial India.",
      "The attackers' footprints, as speculated in the media, led investigators to the influential princely state of Indore, which was a British ally. Mumtaz Begum, a Muslim, had lived in the harem of its Hindu king, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III.",
      "Mumtaz Begum was famed for her beauty. \"In her own class, it was said, Mumtaz was without a peer,\" KL Gauba wrote in his 1945 book, Famous Trials for Love and Murder.",
      "But the Maharaja's (king's) attempts to control her - preventing her from seeing her family alone and keeping her under constant surveillance - soured their relationship, says Kulkarni.",
      "\"I was kept under surveillance. I was allowed to see visitors and my relations but somebody always accompanied me,\" Mumtaz Begum testified in the court.",
      "In Indore, she gave birth to a baby girl, who died soon after.",
      "\"After my child was born, I was unwilling to stay at Indore. I was unwilling because the nurses killed the female child that was born,\" Mumtaz Begum told the court.",
      "Within months, she escaped to the northern Indian city of Amritsar, her mother's place of birth, but troubles followed.",
      "She was watched there too. Mumtaz Begum's stepfather told the court that the Maharaja wept and begged her to return. But she refused and moved to Bombay, where the surveillance continued.",
      "The trial confirmed what media had speculated following the murder: representatives of the Maharaja had indeed threatened Bawla with dire consequences if he continued to shelter Mumtaz Begum, but he had ignored the warnings.",
      "Following a lead given by Shafi Ahmed, the only attacker captured at the scene, the Bombay police arrested seven men from Indore.",
      "The investigation revealed links to the Maharaja that were hard to ignore. Most of the arrested men were employed by the Indore princely state, had applied for leave around the same time and were in Bombay at the time of the crime.",
      "The murder put the British government in a tough spot. Though it happened in Bombay, the investigation clearly showed the plot was planned in Indore, which had strong ties to the British.",
      "Terming it \"the most awkward affair\" for the British government, The New Statesman wrote that if it were a minor state, \"there would be no particular cause for anxiety\".",
      "\"But Indore has been a powerful feudatory of the Raj,\" it said.",
      "The British government initially tried to keep mum about the murder's Indore connection in public. But in private, it discussed the issue with much alarm, communication between the governments of Bombay and British India shows.",
      "Bombay police commissioner Patrick Kelly told the British government that all evidence \"points at present to a conspiracy hatched in Indore or by instigation from Indore to abduct Mumtaj [sic] through hired desperadoes\".",
      "The government faced pressure from different sides. Bawla's community of wealthy Memons, a Muslim community with roots in modern-day Gujarat, raised the issue with the government. His fellow municipal officials mourned his death, saying, \"there surely must be something more behind the scene\".",
      "Indian lawmakers demanded answers in the upper house of British India's legislature and the case was even discussed in the British House of Commons.",
      "Rohidas Narayan Dusar, a former police officer, writes in his book on the murder that the investigators were under pressure to go slow, but that then police commissioner Kelly threatened to resign.",
      "The case drew top lawyers for both the defence and the prosecution when it reached the Bombay High Court.",
      "One of them was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would later become the founding father of Pakistan after India's partition in 1947. Jinnah defended Anandrao Gangaram Phanse, one of the accused and a top general with the Indore army. Jinnah managed to save his client from the death penalty.",
      "The court sentenced three men to death and three to life imprisonment, but it stopped short of holding the Maharaja accountable.",
      "Justice LC Crump, who led the trial, noted, however, that \"there were persons behind them [assailants] whom we cannot precisely indicate\".",
      "\"But where an attempt is made to kidnap a woman, who was for 10 years the mistress of the Maharaja of Indore, it is not in the least unreasonable to look to Indore as the quarter from which this attack may have emanated,\" the judge remarked.",
      "The case's prominence meant the British government had to act quickly against the Maharaja. They gave him a choice: face a commission of inquiry or abdicate, according to documents presented to parliament in India.",
      "The Maharaja chose to quit.",
      "\"I abdicate my throne in favour of my son on the understanding that no further inquiry into my alleged connection with the Malabar Hill Tragedy will be made,\" he wrote to the British government.",
      "After abdicating, the Maharaja stirred more controversy by insisting on marrying an American woman against the will of his family and community. Eventually, she converted to Hinduism and they wed, according to a British home department report.",
      "Meanwhile, Mumtaz Begum received offers from Hollywood and later moved to the US to try her luck there. She faded into obscurity after that."

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 08:39:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC investigates possible scenarios for the huge Arctic territory's future as the US president-elect talks about taking control of it.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, US President-elect Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island.",
      "He first indicated an intention to buy Greenland in 2019, during his first term as president, but this week he went further, refusing to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "Danish and European officials have responded negatively, saying Greenland is not for sale and its territorial integrity must be preserved.",
      "So how could this unusual situation play out, with two Nato allies at odds over a huge territory which is 80% covered with ice but has considerable untapped mineral wealth?",
      "And how could the aspirations for independence among Greenland's population of 56,000, under Danish control for 300 years, affect the final outcome?",
      "Here we look at four possible scenarios for Greenland's future.",
      "Trump loses interest, nothing happens",
      "There is some speculation that Trump's move is just bluster, a move to get Denmark to boost Greenland's security in the face of the threat of both Russia and China seeking influence in the region.",
      "Last month, Denmark announced a new $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) military package for the Arctic. It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".",
      "\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.",
      "Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.",
      "So even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.",
      "But independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.",
      "\"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.",
      "Greenland votes for independence, seeks closer ties with US",
      "There is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it.",
      "However, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.",
      "\"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.",
      "One possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.",
      "Denmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.",
      "\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.",
      "The recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.",
      "But even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.",
      "An agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.",
      "Dr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.",
      "\"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Danes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",
      "Trump steps up economic pressure",
      "There has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.",
      "Professor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory.",
      "Trump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.",
      "Possible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.",
      "One of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk.",
      "Analysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.",
      "Trump invades Greenland",
      "The \"nuclear option\" seems far-fetched, but with Trump failing to rule out military action it has to be considered.",
      "Essentially, it wouldn't be hard for the US to take control, given that they already have bases and plenty of troops in Greenland.",
      "\"The US has de facto control already,\" says Professor Jacobsen, adding that Trump's remarks seemed ill-informed and he didn't understand the point of them.",
      "That said, any use of military force by Washington would create an international incident.",
      "\"If they invade Greenland, they invade Nato,\" says Svane. \"So that's where it stops. Article 5 would have to be triggered. And if a Nato country invades Nato then there's no Nato.\"",
      "Dr Gad says Trump sounds like Chinese President Xi Jinping talking about Taiwan or Russia's Vladimir Putin talking about Ukraine.",
      "\"He's saying it's legitimate for us to take this piece of land,\" he says. \"If we take him really seriously this is a bad omen for the whole of the Western alliance.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 01:12:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Meet the woman who has found an innovative way to simply accessing much-needed aid in war-torn Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "Last autumn Hania Zataari, a mechanical engineer who works for Lebanon's Ministry of Industry put her skills to use as war in the country raged on. Hailing from Sidon, South Lebanon, she created a chatbot on WhatsApp that simplified access to much-needed aid.",
      "\"They lost their houses, their savings, their work, everything they had built,\" Hania says, referring to those forced from their homes by war.",
      "On 23 September, Israel dramatically escalated its offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, with which it had been fighting a spiralling conflict since Hezbollah attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "According to the Lebanese government, at least 492 people were killed in one of Lebanon's deadliest days of conflict in almost 20 years.",
      "Thousands of families fled to Sidon after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) hit what it said was 1,600 Hezbollah strongholds inside Lebanon.",
      "Hania says many displaced people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings, but many others who fled their homes were forced to rent elsewhere or stay with members of their family.",
      "It is these people who weren't directly receiving support from the government that she wanted to help. Drawing on her programming skills, Hania created the \"aidbot\" to narrow the gap between the demand and supply of aid.",
      "The aidbot is a chatbot - a type of AI system designed to communicate with its users online - that links to WhatsApp. It is programmed to ask simple questions about the types of aid people require along with their names and locations.",
      "This information is then recorded onto a Google spreadsheet which Hania and her team of unpaid volunteers, made up of friends and family, access to distribute aid such as food, blankets, mattresses, medicine and clothes.",
      "Hania used her spare time to build the bot using the website Callbell.eu, which is commonly used by businesses to engage with customers on Meta's platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger.",
      "She explains that the bot, which is still being used today, makes distributing aid more efficient as it cuts down the amount of time she spends responding to requests for aid over WhatsApp.",
      "\"I'm not really interested in knowing their names. I just need to know where they are so I can manage the delivery,\" she says.",
      "Take, for example, a request for baby formula. Hania says the bot will ask for the age of the baby and the quantity needed so that she and her team can provide it.",
      "The project, she says, is funded by donations coming from Lebanese people living abroad. She's created a publicly available dashboard to record what the project has spent money on and how much aid she and her team have distributed.",
      "At the time of writing they have delivered 78 food parcels to families of 5 or 10 people, 900 mattresses, and 323 blankets across Sidon and other parts of Lebanon.",
      "Last October, 47 year-old Khaldoun Abbas and his family fled their homes in Najjarieh after they received calls from the IDF urging them to leave for their own safety.",
      "Seventeen people, ranging in age from nine to 78, slept under one roof in a rented three bed apartment in Sidon.",
      "Khaldoun says he, his wife and their children, as well as his brother's family slept on mattresses they requested using the aidbot in the hallway of the flat. They also requested blankets, food and cleaning detergents.",
      "Unlike his neighbours, he's not been able to return to his home. It was destroyed in a confirmed Israeli strike 11 days later. The IDF told the BBC it \"struck a terror infrastructure\".",
      "When we put this allegation to Khaldoun, he denied having any connection to Hezbollah or any other party.",
      "What is Hezbollah and why is Israel attacking Lebanon?",
      "Israel-Hezbollah conflict in maps: Ceasefire in effect in Lebanon",
      "Lebanon's financial crisis explained",
      "\"This isn't the first time Sidon has opened its doors to displaced people,\" Hania explains, referring to the wave of people who have arrived in the city.",
      "Sidon has a long-standing reputation for taking in internally displaced people driven from their homes along the Lebanon-Israel border.",
      "The most recent conflict began in October 2023 after the war between Israel and Hamas spilled over into Lebanon when Hezbollah, Hamas' ally, fired rockets into Israel in support of Gaza.",
      "The Lebanese healthy ministry says nearly 4,000 people have been killed and over a million have been displaced. The ministry does not say how many of these are civilians or combatants.",
      "In Israel around 60,000 people have been evacuated from Northern Israel and authorities say more than 80 soldiers and 47 civilians have been killed.",
      "Last November a ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Lebanon. Despite some skirmishes it has largely been upheld. But people on the ground say the provision of aid has not improved.",
      "International NGO Islamic Relief told the BBC that the \"conflict, destruction, and evacuation orders have fuelled ongoing displacement in Lebanon which has made it difficult to assess and address the needs of the population amid the changing situation.\"",
      "But it is not just the war that is hindering aid distribution.",
      "Bilal Merie, a volunteer working with Hania says many of the problems they face are due to the \"high demand but short supply\" of aid.",
      "He puts it down to the deep economic turmoil that has gripped the country since 2019, meaning the Lebanese government has had to rely heavily on funding from creditors and aid organisations for goods.",
      "But even NGOs are feeling the crunch. Unicef Lebanon says that with only 20% of the funding they need, it \"continues to face an enormous funding gap,\" meaning the charity is unable to support families when they need it most.",
      "In a country overrun with financial woes and by war, could this aidbot make a tangible difference?",
      "It is the first time researcher John Bryant from the think tank Overseas Development Institute has heard of a chatbot being used in such a way in the humanitarian sector.",
      "He says the cultural context in which it is being used is commendable. That is, with knowledge of \"the channels people are using to talk to each other and meeting them in their own language\".",
      "However he is unsure of its scalability, as what works in Lebanon cannot easily be replicated in other parts of the world.",
      "\"What tech offers a lot of the time is a standard cookie cutter approach.",
      "\"It's the local designers, the local translators, the trusted human interlocutors and elements within that system that elevate digital tools into something useful,\" he says.",
      "The aidbot might not be able to offer the solution to all Lebanon's problems, but to the families using it, it has made life a little easier.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 03:03:06 GMT",
    "summary": "India\u2019s six losses in eight Tests raise doubts over Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, and their red-ball future.",
    "story": [
      "Indian cricket fans are still reeling from the team's crushing 1-3 defeat in the five-match Test series against Australia.",
      "Once dominant in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with historic victories over the mighty Australians over the past decade, the tourists fell short, exposing vulnerabilities in a side long thought invincible.",
      "The series highlighted glaring issues - Indian batters struggled, and Jasprit Bumrah was the lone bowler to trouble Australia.",
      "The loss not only cost India the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also denied them a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, breaking their streak of back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2023, where they lost to New Zealand and Australia respectively.",
      "India's recent form is troubling - they have lost six of their last eight Tests, including a shocking 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand.",
      "The defeats have raised questions about the team's depth, the future of key players like captain Rohit Sharma and former skipper Virat Kohli, and their ability to rebuild.",
      "With a team in transition and stalwarts fading, Indian Test cricket faces pressing challenges to sustain its legacy in a rapidly evolving landscape.",
      "India's next red-ball challenge is a five-Test series in England starting July. England's conditions, known for dramatic shifts even within a session, will test players' technique, skills and adaptability to the limit.",
      "India hasn't won a series in England since 2007, with only two prior victories (1971, 1986), highlighting the daunting task ahead. Adding to the pressure, recent failures against New Zealand and Australia leave selectors grappling with tough decisions on player selection and team combinations for this critical campaign.",
      "The biggest headache for selectors is the form of batting stalwarts Sharma and Kohli after dismal outings in Australia and earlier against New Zealand.",
      "Sharma managed just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia, with his poor form seeing him dropping himself for the final game. Kohli fared slightly better with 190 runs in nine innings, but 100 runs of his total came in one knock. His dismissals followed a pattern - caught in the slips or behind the stumps - pointing to a glaring technical flaw or mental fatigue under pressure.",
      "Since January 2024, Sharma has managed just 619 runs in 16 Tests with one century. Kohli's numbers are worse over time - averaging 32 in Tests since 2020 with only two centuries.",
      "Once a late-blooming Test opener and blazing match-winner, Sharma now struggles to find his ideal batting position. Meanwhile, Kohli's surreal decline - after a decade of dominance and swagger- has left cricket's former titan in an extended slump.",
      "From Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli, the baton of Indian batting greatness has passed seamlessly. But a worthy successor to Kohli remains elusive.",
      "KL Rahul has the class but lacks the hunger for consistent big scores. Rishabh Pant is a thrilling maverick, equally capable of winning or losing a match. Shubman Gill, touted as the next Big Thing, has struggled overseas despite his undeniable pedigree and needs careful nurturing.",
      "Punjab's young left-hander Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Yuvraj Singh, is highly rated, while Nitish Kumar Reddy impressed on debut in Australia with his fearless performances in tough situations.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's top Test run-scorer in Australia this series, has been the standout among young batsmen. With panache, patience, technical assurance, and explosive strokes, he looks poised to become Kohli's successor as the team's talisman.",
      "India's talent pool is brimming across departments. Jasprit Bumrah, with his 32-wicket haul against Australia, has cemented his status as a fast-bowling colossus. Backed by Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, and a dozen promising quicks, India boasts a formidable pace arsenal for all formats.",
      "That said, Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation talent and needs careful workload management. Overburdening him, as in the Australia series, risks breakdowns that could impede the attack. Shami, after lengthy stints in rehab, also requires careful handling. Together, they form one of modern cricket's most formidable pace pairs.",
      "With Ravichandran Ashwin's sudden retirement and Ravindra Jadeja's lukewarm showing in Australia, India's spin depth looks thin. However, Washington Sundar has shown promise on home pitches, while young spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Tanush Kotian, who joined the squad mid-series in Australia, are knocking on the doors of Test cricket.",
      "Smarting from recent losses to New Zealand and Australia, the Indian cricket board  is moving swiftly to usher in a transition. Selectors have been directed to shortlist potential Test players from the second round of the domestic Ranji Trophy, resuming 23 January.",
      "All players, including Sharma and Kohli, are likely to be asked to play domestic cricket - a move that could help them regain form.",
      "Managing a team in transition poses complex challenges requiring patience, empathy, and clear vision. Knee-jerk reactions or external pressure could worsen the situation instead of providing solutions.",
      "Whether Sharma and Kohli can overcome their crisis remains to be seen, but India's wealth of talent should lift the current gloom surrounding Indian cricket.",
      "It's worth recalling that in 2011, after winning the ODI World Cup, India was whitewashed 4-0 in Test series against England and Australia. Cricket seemed to hit rock bottom.",
      "But, within months, a revival led by young talents like Kohli, Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Jadeja, Ashwin, and others saw India rise to become the world's top team across formats, holding that position for nearly a decade."

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",

      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",

      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 21:59:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "Brooke Shields has written two New York Times bestsellers that recount a life lived in the public eye, and of the challenges faced in private, whether it be post-partum depression or the loss of her mother. In her latest, \"Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Aging as a Woman\"\u00a0(\u200eto be published January 14 by Flatiron Books), the model, actress and entrepreneur writes about the wrinkles that come with society's expectations of women as they reach or surpass \"a certain age.\"",
      "Shields, who will turn 60 in May, says that external perceptions don't match up with her internal sense of self, and that later years are something \"to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive.\" She also notes how society's ignorance of the power (not to mention the purchasing power) of women middle-aged and older is short-sighted at best.",

      "\"Brooke Shields is Not Allowed to Get Old\"",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "summary": "Court to hear arguments Friday on law forcing TikTok sale by Chinese parent company that takes effect in Jan. 19.",
    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",

      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

It targets the central nervous system and can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, according\u00a0to the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",

    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",

      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",
      "The company \"immediately took steps to address\" the issues, the statement said, and added that the FDA classified\u00a0the inspection as not resulting in \"administrative or regulatory action\" against the company.",

      "The FDA said that Taylor Farms quality control officials had signed off on cleaning at the facility as passing, even when agency inspectors said they could still see \"several food contact surfaces that were not visually clean and should have been marked as a 'Fail'.\"",
      "Food debris building up on the company's equipment was so bad that it was leading to cross-contamination, the FDA's inspectors worried. A company that had been buying green peppers from Taylor Farms complained that onions had found their way into their ready-to-eat product.",

    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",
      "The hospitalized child in Canada initially had conjunctivitis and fever before later developing cough, vomiting and diarrhea. She was later intubated after respiratory failure.",

The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.",
      "HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus.

      "HMPV infections are reportedly surging in China, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.",
      "\"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity,\" she said, adding that the virus was fairly stable, unlike the COVID-19 virus that mutates often, making it harder to fight.",
      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",
      "\"Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years,\" Indian Health Minister J. P. Nadda said Monday. \"The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.\"",
      "Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was \"closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries.\"",
      "The Health Ministry also said the HMPV infections were \"no cause of concern,\" as there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses detected in the country, and it noted that India was well prepared for any surge should it occur.",

It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:51:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",

      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here.

    "summary": "The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase explains why he's referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme; his bank's efforts to improve the lives of lower-income Americans; and his recent near-death experience.",
    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

    "title": "Before the Palisades Fire, many of those homeowners had lost insurance",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 18:14:17 -0500",
    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California whose district includes parts of Los Angeles, told CBS MoneyWatch she will soon re-introduce a bill called the Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act, which would require the Government Accountability Office to analyze the dangers posed by wildfires to communities, and how insurance companies are responding.",
      "\"It will help us determine what the best federal response is to these issues,\" Waters said. \"We have to know more about climate change,\" such as determining which areas or types of vegetation are more susceptible to wildfires, and the risk of building in those areas.",
      "She added that the higher risks are \"leaving homeowners and business owners and families without insurance coverage because some of the insurance companies are canceling; they are aren't writing any new insurance. People continue to pay higher prices for even less coverage.\"",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

      "The imprisoned firefighters volunteer to participate in CDCR's Conservation (Fire) Camps Program and are paid for their work. Participants supports state, local and federal government agencies when they respond to natural disasters. Specifically, they are removing vegetation to cut fire lines and taking away fuel from behind structures to slow the blaze. Inmates can also serve in support roles at the camps, including cooking, laundry and water treatment plant operation.",

      "CDCR operates 35 so-called fire camps across 25 different California counties, employing approximately 1,870 incarcerated people. Two of the camps are for incarcerated women. They are minimum-security facilities staffed with correctional personnel who supervise camp participants 24 hours per day.",
      "Participation in the camps is voluntary, and those who join in must be deemed physically and mentally fit. Additionally, they must have no more than eight years remaining on their sentences. Convictions for rape and other sex offenses, as well as for murder, arson and some other serious crimes, disqualifies an inmate from participating.",
      "How much do incarcerated firefighters earn?",
      "Imprisoned firefighters' pay depends on their skill level. They earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to CDCR, which pays their wages. Wage levels doubled in 2023, up from between $2.90 and $5.12 per day.",
      "Inmates in the program also earn supplemental pay while responding to emergencies. Cal Fire pays an additional $1 an hour, regardless of firefighters' skill level. And when crews work a 24-hour shift, followed by a 24-hour period of rest, the lowest-skilled firefighter would earn $26.90 in a day.",
      "Additionally, camp participants earn time credits toward their sentences. Specifically, most earn two additional days off their sentences for every day served on a fire crew.",
      "Camp participants are eligible for employment with Cal Fire once they have served their sentences, a path many choose to take, according to CDCR. The department says some of these individuals have successfully transitioned to roles with Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, and interagency hotshot crews.",
      "As of Friday, the\u00a0fires\u00a0had scorched more than 55 square miles across the Los Angeles area. At least 10 people are dead, and more than 300,000 Los Angelenos were under evacuation orders, according to officials.",

    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the jobless rate stood at 6.4%, while inflation was about to soar to 40-year highs, kicking off a flurry of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to tame price increases.",
      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L.

      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "As deadly\u00a0wildfires engulf swaths\u00a0of Los Angeles County, forcing nearly 200,000 people from their houses, a still-to-be known number of residents will be contending with insurance claims to recoup losses and rebuild or repair their homes. For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",
      "The good news? Unlike with\u00a0flooding, a standard homeowners' policy covers destruction and damage caused by fire, including wildfires, and a\u00a0standard renters' insurance policy covers the renter's personal belongings, according to the Insurance Information Institute.",
      "The optional comprehensive part of a standard auto insurance policy covers vehicles against damage caused by fire and falling objects. Approximately 75% of U.S. drivers opt to buy it.",
      "\"California property insurers are acting as financial first responders to help their impacted customers recover from the Los Angeles fires,\" the institute stated on Thursday. \"This includes providing immediate relief through additional living expenses coverage (ALE) for displaced policyholders. Losses to property and vehicles will be covered up to the limits contained with an insurance policy.\"",
      "Property insurers are required to immediately pay policyholders a minimum of one-third of the estimated value of their personal belongings and a minimum of four months' worth of rent for the local area in which they live, it stated, citing state regulations.",
      "When and how to file a claim",
      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",
      "Things to know and watch out for",
      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",
      "2. Pack important documents:",

      "3. Start savings receipts. Wildfire evacuees can file for reimbursement for additional living expenses. Check the \"loss of use\" section of your policy. If your home is not damaged and your temporary living expenses are modest, keep in mind that filing a claim goes on your record and can hike your insurance costs.",

      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:04:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of taxpayers continue to struggle with delays in refunds from the IRS, a new tax advocate report says.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans continue to grapple with IRS delays that are preventing them from getting their tax refunds in a timely manner, according to a new report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog that's part of the IRS.",
      "The report, published annually to highlight the IRS' most glaring problems, comes after the agency was given billions in new funding through the Inflation Reduction Act to improve its technology and go after wealthy tax cheats. Yet for many taxpayers, dealing with the IRS involves \"delays, frustration and unnecessary costs,\" the taxpayer advocate, Erin M. Collins, wrote in the report.",
      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",
      "It's a different service than the IRS' relatively new Direct File service, which will be available in more than 20 states this tax season, from Alaska to Wyoming.",

What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Jan. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jonathan Vigliotti, thank you. We turn now to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "FEMA ADMINISTRATOR DEANNE CRISWELL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Santa Ana winds are forecast to continue into the next week, and that could fuel some of the blazes. What is your biggest area of concern right now?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, with these winds coming back, and them issuing the red flag warnings, you know, these winds change the- the dynamics of this fire, and so I'm concerned for the safety of our firefighters, concerned for their ability continue to contain this fire, and I want people to make sure that they are listening closely to what local officials are saying, so they can stay safe and they can stay out of harm's way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know the winds themselves are rare for this particular time of year, but Los Angeles, in the area, they got a lot of experience with wildfires. They have a lot of regulation and a large firefighting force. Do you have a sense at this point why the area was so unprepared?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: I think that they were very prepared. This is something that they are very used to, they fight fires all the time. But they have never seen 100 mile an hour winds that are fueling the fire, and those winds and that weather condition is what really impacts, you know, where this fire is going to go, but more importantly, how they're able to try to contain it in those first few hours and days. And because it was in such a populated area, it just makes it that much more challenging to be able to get in there and secure the perimeter, but as well, try to save as many homes as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the federal response and the support you're given to local authorities, President Biden spoke a few times from the oval office this week, and he did mention the need to move power lines underground. Do you know, were the power lines a cause of any of these blazes?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I don't have any information on the cause, and I think that's certainly going to be something that's going to be, you know, under investigation. But I think when we think about moving the power lines underground, it's not just from the cause, but it's also, how do you keep the power on when we have these severe weather incidents? When you underground them, you create a more resilient community, and it can withstand the impacts of all of these different types of storms, whether it's fires or hurricanes, and we want to be able to keep these communities energized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will that be a requirement for any federal support for the rebuild?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: It's not going to be a requirement for us unless it's part of their local code, right? And we want to be able to enforce the local codes that they have, and so we'll work closely with California. It's also using this as an opportunity. You know, even if it's not a requirement, is this something that they want to be able to do? We have additional ways that we can fund that through our programs as they begin the rebuilding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The governor has indicated he's looking at a number of executive orders. If local environmental regulations are loosened here in order to help quickly rebuild, does that concern you at all? And will it make it more complicated for people to obtain ob- insurance, which we already know is quite expensive and hard for many Californians to get.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, the insurance piece is a real concern. We've, you know, heard the stories of so many people that have lost their insurance prior to this event, and that's the number one resource that families have to help with their rebuilding process. And so what I think we want to be able to do is we want to be able to work with the governor's team to rebuild in a way that makes communities more resilient, that keeps insurance companies there, right, that we rebuild in a way that makes them stronger, and reducing the impact so they want to stay in these communities, and they don't have to to lose the insurance carriers. We have to be able to work together with the insurance industry to help find ways to- to keep this really valuable resource in place for so many families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, many of these policies were already canceled months ago, as we've been reporting. So should the government, though, be in the business of stepping in and helping people rebuild if the private market has deemed these areas just too risky?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: You know, our programs really help jump start the recovery process, but without insurance, families are going to have to find other means to be able to rebuild. But again, it's not necessarily just where you rebuild, it's going to be how. And we want to be able to do things that can encourage families to rebuild their homes in a way that make them more fire resistant. You know, we have a lot of science and technology out there that shows ways that we can make these homes stronger and more resistant against these fires. That's really where we need to focus our efforts as we move into the rebuilding phase.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said that 100% of the firefighting costs will be picked up for six months on the federal tab, but there is the separate issue of individual assistance to victims who lost their homes. We checked, and Congress set the maximum FEMA grant level at just short of $44,000. It's very expensive living in California. Does that need to be raised? Should Congress do that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: So again, our programs aren't designed to replace insurance. Our programs are designed to jump start the recovery process, and we know that in- in many areas, not just California, that you know that is not going to be enough to rebuild a home, which is why insurance is so important. We'll work with other partners, and one of our greatest partners is the Small Business Administration that can do low interest loans to these families to give them another resource to help rebuild. We'll also work with our nonprofit partners, philanthropic partners, bringing the whole society together so we can work with each family to help them figure out the right tools that they're going to need and the decisions that they're going to have to make as they go down this recovery journey",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're describing a really costly enterprise here. I've seen estimates on damages that range from $60 to $130 billion. Do you have any ballpark figure at this point\u2013",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: \u2013No\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Because it would seem, according to President Biden, that Congress is going to have to do more.",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I don't have any good estimates right now, and I think it's important to remember that these fires are still burning, which means damage is still happening. But the cost for this disaster, both from just the physical infrastructure, but also the economic losses, they're going to be significant. There's going to be other programs that congress can work through, like HUD's Community Development Block Grant for Disaster program, that can also help cover some of the things that FEMA's programs don't cover, or other parts of the insurance industry. There's a wide variety of different tools and resources that can be used that need to be authorized by Congress to really help this community on this road to recovery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Congress did just provide more emergency funding in the supplemental. So this is- this is not a one time problem. This seems to be a recurring need to get more and more federal money here. Can you update us on where we are with the recovery in North Carolina?",
      "08:43:19",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL: Yeah, I mean, I'm glad you mentioned the funding, because we really were worried about that as we were going into the recovery in North Carolina, but we got bipartisan support from Congress and $27 billion into our disaster relief fund so we can support the response and recovery efforts for this fire, but also the ongoing recovery efforts that are happening across the six states that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, as well as Hurricane Milton. You know, we're continuing to work with- with Governor Stein, now in- in North Carolina, as he's working through the recovery piece and, you know, working on getting the debris removal out of the way so families can rebuild their homes, helping them restore the infrastructure. We still have so many people engaged in North Carolina helping with this recovery process, because we know it's going to be complicated. It's going to be complicated here in California, but we're going to bring in the right experts and the right staff to support them throughout that journey.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Secretary Mayorkas recently told us that you all had to pull some federal workers out of the area, out of North Carolina, because of threats against them that's fueled by misinformation. Has that ended, or is that threat continuing?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL",
      "Yeah, I just want to be clear, we had one specific incident at one day during the response in North Carolina, where we pulled people from going door to door, but we always kept our facilities open, and we had people in all of those communities. But it's really unfortunate that we had to do that right because the misinformation was creating these harassing environments for our staff. We do- it is not like what we saw, you know, during those initial days in North Carolina, but we've put measures in place to make sure that our staff know that they're safe and that they're protected, and that we can continue to support people. They are going door to door, still talking to individuals, and we have these fixed facilities where individuals can come talk to us. But you know, this is going to be something we're going to have to face going forward is this level of misinformation that's going out there and getting people to know that they can access our programs, we're going to have to work closely with local officials on all these events to make sure we're getting the right information to the people that have been impacted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, we appreciate you joining us today to get the message out. Administrator Criswell, good luck to you.",

      "Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over two investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned, according to a Justice Department court filing submitted on Saturday.",
      "CBS News recently reported Smith would resign from the Justice Department after completing his work.",
      "According to court documents, Smith \"separated from the Department on January 10.\" The revelation was made in a federal court filing amid an ongoing dispute between Justice Department officials and defense attorneys tied to the president-elect over the release of one volume of Smith's two-volume report.",
      "Attorneys for Trump's former codefendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira have sought to extend an order by Judge Aileen Cannon barring the Justice Department from releasing a portion of Smith's report.",
      "Regulations require special counsels to submit a report to the attorney general detailing their investigative findings and prosecutorial decisions. Garland has pledged to release to the public all reports completed under his tenure and has so far done so, including after an investigation into President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Court filings earlier this week revealed Smith had submitted a two-volume report to Garland on Jan. 7, just days after attorneys for Trump and his codefendants reviewed a draft report. Trump's attorneys subsequently wrote a letter to Garland asking him to remove Smith from his post and prevent the release of the report, according to court filings.",
      "Following the review, attorneys for Trump's codefendants asked Cannon, who initially dismissed one of Smith's cases against Trump in July, and judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to stop Garland from releasing the report.",
      "Smith was appointed in November of 2022 to take over two Justice Department investigations into Trump, one related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and another tied to his handling of classified records after he left office. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Trump. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Smith's dual cases against Trump were ultimately closed last year after Trump won the presidential election. Prosecutors wrote that Justice Department regulations forbid the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The special counsel at the time opted to keep an appeal of Cannon's dismissal of the classified documents investigation open in the cases of Nauta and de Oliveira. It was in this case that their attorneys sought to prevent the release of the report, arguing doing so would prejudice their case.",
      "In response, the Justice Department revealed the attorney general would not release the volume of the report dealing with the classified documents probe until the case is completely closed, and instead make it available to a select group of members of Congress.",
      "Still, the defense attorneys and Trump's legal team have urged the federal courts to stop the release of the other portion of the report detailing Smith's probe into the 2020 election.",
      "Right now, the report remains unreleased after Cannon ordered the Justice Department to keep the report under wraps until at least Sunday. Judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump codefendants' bid to further enjoin prosecutors from releasing the report.",
      "Defense attorneys have now asked Cannon to extend her order forbidding the report's release, a move the Justice Department opposes.",

      "Appearing in court virtually from his Mar-a-Lago home Friday, President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced for his crimes in the\u00a0New York \"hush money\" case\u00a0and released with no restrictions.",
      "Justice Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0followed through on a promise made one week ago to give Trump a sentence of unconditional discharge, which includes neither jail time nor any other restriction that might impede Trump after his inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "Merchan said during sentencing Friday that he was granting that sentence because he believed it was the only legal option, just 10 days before Trump assumes the presidency.",
      "Merchan told the court that \"this has been a truly extraordinary case,\" even though once the courtroom doors closed, the trial itself had been in his estimation no more special or unique than any other.",
      "However, he told Trump, the same could not be said about the circumstances surrounding the president-elect's sentencing \"because of the office you once occupied and will soon occupy again.\" Merchan said that it was the legal protections afforded to the office of the president that were extraordinary, \"not the occupant of the office.\"",
      "Those legal protections were a factor that overrode all others, Merchan said, but they were not a mitigating factor. He said they did not reduce the seriousness of the crimes or erase the jury's verdict.",
      "Merchan said he determined that the only lawful sentence he could give, without encroaching on the highest post in the land, was an unconditional discharge.",
      "Donald Trump, the civilian, he said, might not have gotten so lenient a sentence.",

      "\"With all the horrible things that are going on, I got indicted for calling a legal expense a legal expense,\" Trump said, referring to the falsified reimbursements to a former lawyer, for a \"hush money\" payment at the core of the case.",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "\"The fact is I'm totally innocent,\" Trump said. \"I did nothing wrong.\"",
      "Ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Trump's actions in attacking the judicial system and prosecutors in this case \"constitutes a direct attack on the rule of law itself.\"",
      "\"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends, and to encourage others to reject the jury verdict that he finds so distasteful,\" Steinglass said.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" Steinglass said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was in attendance, in the gallery, but did not address the court.",
      "Blanche said that he strongly disagreed with Steinglass' assessment of the case and Trump's conduct. He claimed it was not just Trump and experts cited by Trump who felt the case should not have been brought, but the majority of the American people, referring to those who voted for the Republican in November.",
      "At every turn, Trump and his lawyers have fought Manhattan prosecutors since the beginning of the \"hush money\" investigation in 2018. They challenged prosecutors' subpoenas and rulings by Merchan, battling all the way to the Supreme Court multiple times, including an effort this week to stave off Friday's hearing.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court said it would not intervene on Trump's behalf, clearing the way for Merchan to issue his decision. Trump, soon after the high court's decision, said he had read it and \"thought it was a fair decision, actually,\" noting the Supreme Court justices pointed out he could appeal and that there would be \"really\u2026no penalty.\"",
      "\"But we're going to appeal anyway,\" he added in his remarks Thursday night.",
      "\"So, I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent,\" Trump said.",
      "Although there are no cameras in the courtroom, an audio recording of the proceedings will be released after the hearing concludes.",
      "While Trump's trial and arraignment brought crowds and overnight lines, on Friday morning, the general public line was sparse and no onlookers in the park across the street were visible before dawn.",
      "Trump was found guilty in May after a seven-week trial. A unanimous jury concluded he committed 34 felonies in authorizing a scheme in 2017 to falsify records, in order to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.",
      "Daniels testified during the trial, as did Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who received the falsified reimbursements for his wire to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen gave Daniels the $130,000 payment in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.",
      "Multiple witnesses testified that Trump was pleased voters did not learn of Daniels' story before the 2016 election.",
      "Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times during the trial for violations of a gag order barring him from making public comments about witnesses, court staff and others. In issuing the 10th contempt citation, Merchan \u2014 who frequently acknowledged the unique circumstances of the trial and its famed, powerful defendant \u2014 foreshadowed Friday's likely sentence.",
      "\"The last thing I want to do is to put you in jail,\" Merchan said.",
      "Merchan on Friday told Trump, \"the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching on the highest office in the land, is an unconditional discharge.",
      "\"Godspeed as you assume your second term in office,\" Merchan said.",

      "As wildfires spread across Southern California this week, President-elect Donald Trump cast blame on state leaders and called for California Gov. Gavin Newsom to resign in a series of Truth Social posts.",
      "Trump accused Newsom of prioritizing environmental policies over public safety, and claimed that FEMA lacked the funds to respond to the crisis. CBS News Confirmed looked into some of the claims. Here's what we know.",
      "Newsom disputes Trump's claim about a water restoration declaration",
      "Trump claimed Newsom \"refused to sign the water restoration declaration\" that he said would have directed millions of gallons of water to areas now burning, alleging he prioritized a small fish, called a smelt, over residents.",
      "In response, Newsom's office said, \"There is no such document as the water restoration declaration \u2013 that is pure fiction.\"",
      "Trump appeared to reference his administration's 2019 proposal to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Central Valley farms and Southern California urban areas.",
      "California officials and environmentalists successfully sued to challenge it in part because they argued the rules would endanger wildlife in the Delta, including the smelt fish.",
      "In December, President Biden's administration, in cooperation with Newsom, endorsed new regulations they said will allow more water to be pulled from the Delta to Southern California while also protecting local wildlife.",
      "An official who helps oversee Southern California's water supply refuted Trump's claim that his proposed changes could have mitigated the wildfires.",
      "Mark Gold, water scarcity director for the Natural Resources Defense Council and member of the Metropolitan Water District Board that provides water to 19 million people in Southern California, told CBS News, \"The issues have nothing to do with what amount of water we have stored within the region. The Metropolitan Water District has a record amount of water stored at this time.\"",
      "Southern California has ample water supply after previous years of decent rains, Gold said, but the lack of rain in the region in recent months dried out vegetation \u2014 something Trump's proposal wouldn't have helped with.",

      "Qui\u00f1ones said the tanks, which supply pressure for hydrants in the hilly Palisades, couldn't refill fast enough as firefighting efforts drained water faster than the main trunk line could supply it.",
      "L.A. Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said the LADWP proactively filled all available water storage tanks before the fires began. It followed some widely shared claims on social media that officials had refused or failed to fill the tanks.",
      "Mark Pestrella, director of the L.A. County Department of Public Works,\u00a0said that the municipal water systems for the impacted areas were overworked, partly because firefighters were unable to use air support due to high winds and poor visibility.",
      "\"The municipal water systems that service our homes and businesses continue to work effectively. However, they're not designed to fight wildfires. A firefight with multiple fire hydrants, drawing water from the system for several hours is unsustainable. This is a known fact,\" Pastrella said.",

Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland \u2014 a semiautonomous territory of Denmark \u2014 a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",

      "Trump's desire for Greenland has sparked anxiety in Denmark as well as across Europe. The United States is a strong ally of 27-nation European Union and the leading member of the NATO alliance, and many Europeans were shocked by the suggestion that an incoming U.S. leader could even consider using force against an ally.",
      "But Frederiksen said that she sees a positive aspect in the discussion.",

But it's a vast territory possessing natural resources that include oil, gas, and rare earth elements, which are expected to become more accessible as ice melts because of climate change. Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite. These rare materials are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries. China currently produces about 65% of the world's graphite.",

    "summary": "Two Georgia election workers asked a federal judge to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt for allegedly continuing to defame them in violation of a court order.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., found Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court Friday, saying that he violated a court order not to defame two former Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss.",
      "D.C. District Judge Beryl Howell said Friday that Giuliani had violated the consent judgment against him \"at least six ways.\" She said his statements \"accuse plaintiffs of improper, illegal conduct in relation to the 2020 election,\" in violation of the injunction.",
      "\"Mr. Giuliani engaged in the worst kind of defamation, wrongly accusing these two women, these plaintiffs, of engaging in serious election crimes,\" Howell said, although he had agreed not to make such statements.",
      "\"It is outrageous and shameful that Mr. Giuliani dares to suggest that he is the one being treated unfairly when his conduct has caused the plaintiffs real harm, as he heard about at the trial,\" the judge said.",
      "In 2023, a jury awarded Freeman and Moss $148 million in a judgment against Giuliani for falsely claiming the pair engaged in a fake ballot processing scheme in Fulton County, Georgia, during the 2020 election. District Judge Beryl Howell determined Giuliani was liable for defaming the two after they became focal points of his unfounded claims.",
      "Late last year, the women alleged Giuliani continued to defame them, claiming he had said on two broadcast shows that video showed them \"quadruple counting\" ballots and passing hard drives meant to \"fix\" voting machines. Court papers quote Giuliani saying in a Nov. 12, 2024 broadcast, \"I'm sorry they're going to sue me again for saying it, but what am I going to do but tell the truth?\"",
      "\"These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,\" attorneys for the women wrote in court filings.",
      "At the outset of Friday's hearing, Judge Howell told Giuliani, \"You're the most famous person in this courtroom right now. You've got a bigger audience. You've got a bigger public following than anybody in this courtroom. You have a respected public service history with that background.\"",
      "\"I had hoped that what you heard, sworn to under oath in this courtroom, would make you realize that what you were saying about the plaintiffs just wasn't true, and that you'd stop saying those things,\" she continued.",
      "Giuliani protested, \"No, I did not,\" when she said he'd sworn to not say anything to defame Freeman and Moss.",
      "Freeman and Moss' attorney, Michael Gottlieb, said of Giuliani's comment claiming the two passed hard drives to each other that \"this is a specific reference, referenced multiple times in the appendix to the injunction about his allegation, which is a false allegation that our clients were passing a hard drive in order to influence the machines.\"",
      "Gottlieb argued that it was clear Giuliani was talking about Freeman and Moss with the comment that the two were seen \"quadruple counting ballots,\" because there's only one video from the 2020 election in Georgia that Giuliani has ever alleged involved multiple counting of ballots, the video from the State Farm Arena, in Atlanta. This, he said, was \"a crystal clear reference\" to Freeman and Moss.",
      "Judge Howell pressed Gottlieb on how anyone would know Giuliani was specifically referring to Freeman and Moss, since he never referred to them by name. But Gottlieb responded that the average person should not be the standard applied in this case.",
      "\"The injunction was specifically written to avoid a situation where [Giuliani] might not use their names, but instead might talk obliquely in order to convey the same defamatory meaning, the same implications about the plaintiffs, without using their names directly,\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Giuliani's attorney, Eden Quainton, claimed Giuliani's legal team had not been told of the examples of defamation after the trial and claimed the allegations were not clear.",
      "\"When you look at the text of those videos, the fact that he had to bring in another video that wasn't previously brought to our attention as proof of what the November 12 said, that really undermines the idea that he had clear and convincing evidence to start with,\" Quainton said.",
      "Judge Howell stopped Quainton several times and at one point told him, \"This is really a waste of time.\"",
      "Freeman and Moss are seeking a $20,000 monetary compensation for each future violation of the consent judgement, paid to the court using Giuliani's exempt assets, such as his IRA account and Florida condominium. They're asking for an order specifying that Giuliani use any assets he claims as assets, some of which are currently being litigated in New York. Howell indicated she planned to rule on a motion Friday.",
      "Since the defamation trial, Giuliani has appeared in several separate court proceedings about his ability to pay the fine.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Manhattan held him in contempt for failing to turn over information about his assets to contribute to paying off the $148 million he owes. Court papers say he has handed over some possessions, including a car, but the court said he failed to give them access to his other assets and information. The litigation over his finances continues.",
      "Ahead of Friday's hearing in Washington, D.C., Giuliani had asked to appear virtually, citing health problems and safety concerns. He ultimately withdrew that request after the judge appeared skeptical of his claims.",
      "Giuliani and his defense team pushed back on the latest claims, alleging Freeman and Moss failed to \"present clear and convincing evidence of a violation,\" adding they did not consider \"Giuliani's substantial compliance with the consent judgment since its entry.\"",
      "His attorneys argued the alleged violations did not meet the standard of contempt and his statements had been unclear and lacked context.",
      "\"Giuliani has scrupulously avoided mentioning the names of the Plaintiffs and has, as noted, referenced the Georgia ballot counting irregularities in connection with his other legal issues, including a pending indictment in Arizona,\" they wrote.",
      "Freeman and Moss disputed these claims. Their attorneys urged the court to put Giuliani \"on notice that he will face fines for any similar conduct that occurs in the future.\"",
      "Throughout the days-long trial that resulted in the $148 million ruling, jurors heard directly from Freeman and Moss, who described the terror they felt after they were thrust into the public eye after the 2020 election. The mother and daughter both said their lives had been changed when they were publicly identified, and a barrage of racist threats followed.",
      "An investigation by the Georgia secretary of state later concluded that \"[a]ll allegations made against Freeman and Moss were unsubstantiated and found to have no merit.\"",

      "The Biden administration on Friday announced it would extend the temporary legal status of nearly 1 million immigrants from El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela, utilizing a program that is expected to be curtailed by the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The announcement will allow Salvadoran, Sudanese, Ukrainian and Venezuelan immigrants who currently have Temporary Protected Status to renew their work permits and deportation protections under the policy, which offers a legal reprieve to foreigners from countries beset by war, natural disasters or other emergencies that make deportations unsafe.",
      "The decision is set to benefit roughly 234,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the programs. The TPS program for El Salvador will be extended through March 2026, while the designations for Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela will be extended through October 2026.",
      "Friday's move is notable since TPS is expected to be scaled back by the President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to dismantle Biden administration immigration policy, enact tougher immigration rules and launch a mass deportation campaign. TPS designations can be revoked by the DHS secretary, as long as the government provides a 60-day notice.",
      "Trump and incoming Vice President JD Vance have both signaled their opposition to TPS, which Republican lawmakers and immigration hawks have long argued has been improperly extended, despite its temporary nature. During Trump's first administration, the government tried to end TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, though its efforts were stalled by legal challenges.",
      "While it announced the TPS extensions, the Biden administration on Friday declined to make new arrivals eligible for the temporary status, despite calls from progressive activists who say the move would make it harder for Trump to carry out his promised mass deportations. Redesignating the TPS program for Venezuela, for example, would make an additional 450,000 migrants eligible for the initiative, according to internal government estimates obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Biden administration has also faced pressure from advocates to allow hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants to apply for TPS ahead of Trump's inauguration. But officials are leaning against it, two people familiar with internal deliberations told CBS News, in part due to concerns about the move appearing like a politically motivated effort to hinder the incoming administration.",
      "Friday's move affects a diverse population of immigrants, with different legal circumstances.",

      "Most of the Venezuelans enrolled in the TPS program crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or entered the country under Biden administration programs designed to reduce illegal immigration over the past four years. They have arrived in the U.S. as part of a larger exodus from Venezuela that has seen 8 million people flee economic calamity and government repression in the South American nation.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to be released with no restrictions Friday after his criminal conviction in the\u00a0\"hush money\" case in New York.",
      "Though he'll receive no punishment under the unconditional discharge sentence, Trump and his attorney pledged to appeal his conviction as he prepares to take office in 10 days as the 47th president of the United States. Speaking virtually from his residence in Florida, Trump continued to insist during the hearing that he's \"totally innocent.\"",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "Prosecutors had also recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge, given Trump's impending inauguration, but not before blasting Trump's behavior and the precedent it sets.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.",
      "Listen to the Trump sentencing hearing audio",
      "Although cameras were not allowed in the courtroom to provide video of the hearing, after its conclusion the court released the audio, which can be heard in the player above.",
      "What was Trump sentenced for?",
      "The case stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 \"hush money\" payment\u00a0Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors claimed the payment was made to keep voters unaware of Daniels' allegation that she had sex with Trump years earlier, a claim Trump still denies.",
      "Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree, a felony in New York, and a jury convicted him on all 34 counts.",
      "What is an unconditional discharge?",
      "An unconditional discharge, the sentence Merchan imposed on Trump, allows release without any formal punishment or ability to impose punishment at a further date.",
      "That means no prison time, no community service volunteer time and no fines for his conviction. The maximum sentence, which a first offender would have been unlikely to receive, was four years in prison and several thousand dollars in fines for each of the 34 counts.",
      "\"This court has determined that the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching on the highest office in the land, is an unconditional discharge,\" Merchan told Trump, wishing him \"Godspeed\" on his second term.",
      "The sentence is a highly unusual one, which Merchan suggested he had imposed because of legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States.",

Another rioter took a photo of Vo standing next to his mother, Annie Vo, in the Capitol's Rotunda as he raised a flag above his head.",
      "Prosecutors allege Vo was inside the Capitol\u00a0for approximately 27 minutes, snapping photos and yelling \"Freedom!\" while moving through the Capitol complex.",
      "At a court hearing in April, prosecutors argued Vo had already demonstrated a pattern of defiance against the court system. Vo was accused of violating his pretrial release conditions by attending a protest outside of the Washington, D.C., jail in support of Jan. 6 rioters. The judge placed a curfew on Vo during his case, due to violations of court orders, according to the Justice Department's filings.",
      "In a court filing, prosecutors said, \"Vo's complete lack of remorse for his actions on January 6 should also animate the Court's decision regarding his sentence. Within minutes of leaving the Capitol building on January 6, Vo used text messages and social media to brag about intimidating\u00a0police officers, halting the vote count, and storming the building. His lack of contrition continued after his trial when he repeatedly used social media to dispute his guilt, where he called himself a 'J6 wrongful convict.'\"",

      "Find updates from the TikTok Supreme Court arguments here.",
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Atlanta on Thursday rejected a bid to block the release of a portion of\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigation and prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump stemming from an alleged plan to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied the request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, who were charged for their role in allegedly obstructing a separate federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records.",
      "The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election, and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.",
      "Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.",
      "But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public, arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the documents case, to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter, leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days, though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief, it could file a notice of appeal.",
      "On Thursday night, the Justice Department filed its appeal of Cannon's injunction. That appeal now also goes to the 11th Circuit.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment, as did lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira. Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in a statement that \"It is time for Joe Biden and Merrick Garland to do the right thing and put a final stop to the political weaponization of our Justice system.\"",
      "In filings with the 11th Circuit, the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public, but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.",
      "Separately, the president-elect's lawyers\u00a0urged Garland\u00a0in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.",
      "Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "In their own filing with the 11th Circuit, defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and, in the meantime, prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.",
      "\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" they wrote.",
      "Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.",
      "The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"",

Three fires are still raging, the president said, and 179,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.",

      "\"We are literally waiting to see which way the wind blows,\" she said.",

      "Officials Thursday said more than 1,300 structures have burned, with 60,000 structures threatened, as the blazes burn largely uncontained in densely populated and expensive neighborhoods of Southern California.",
      "Mr. Biden was supposed to speak in Thermal, California, earlier this week, but his remarks were canceled due to excessive high winds. He was briefed on the fires while in California instead. The president canceled a trip to Italy to see Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni this week so he could focus on the federal response to the blazes.",

      "A plea hearing to enable alleged 9/11 terror attack mastermind\u00a0Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\u00a0to avoid the death penalty will not go forward Friday, after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday to pause the proceedings to allow the court to receive full briefings and hear arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The court did not rule on whether Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has the power to reverse the plea agreements with Mohammed and other defendants, but instead said it needs more time to make that decision.",

      "According to the motion, the plea agreements reached over the summer, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them for their alleged roles in the terrorist attacks, in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty. The charges include murder, conspiracy and terrorism, as well as an eighth charge of intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",
      "Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including Mohammed's plea hearing Friday \u2014 while the request was being considered.",
      "Family members who travelled to Guantanamo Bay are devastated that the plea proceedings won't go forward Friday. Eight of them were speaking to reporters when the court granted the administrative stay. All eight supported the plea agreements, though they acknowledged other victims' families do not.",

      "Gates said of the trip with her mother, \"I see her in so much pain all the time, and this was the first time I got to be here to see it for myself.

      "Soon after the plea agreements were reached,\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0tried to revoke them, arguing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the power to approve the plea deals, rather than the subordinate authority who accepted the deals.",

Austin has since reiterated that he still feels he should be the person who makes the decision on the 9/11 plea deals.

      "New York Justice Juan Merchan rejected Trump's latest motions to dismiss the case, and set aside his conviction, which argued a president-elect is entitled to the same protections from criminal proceedings as a president. Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.",
      "New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune will now decide which, if any, amendments will be considered on the floor. Some Democrats who voted to proceed said they did so in order to offer changes to the legislation before deciding how they would vote on final passage.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security is mandated to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault. The Laken Riley Act would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes.",
      "Whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding is an open question. The agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress.",

      "A growing list of Democrats announced their plans to support the Republican-led measure ahead of Thursday's vote, including Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Fetterman and Gallego are co-sponsors in the Senate, and Slotkin voted for the legislation as a member of the House last year.",

This week, 48 House Democrats joined all voting Republicans to approve the measure \u2014 up from 37 who did so last year \u2014 despite pushback from some Democrats who have argued that the bill is merely political posturing.",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:08:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Blue Origin expects the New Glenn to provide a viable alternative to SpaceX's market-dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
    "story": [
      "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin readied the company's powerful New Glenn rocket for its delayed but long-awaited maiden flight early Monday, kicking off a high-stakes bid to compete head-to-head with Elon Musk's SpaceX and its industry dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
      "While more than one successful test flight will be needed to demonstrate the reliability needed for launches of costly NASA probes, high-priority national security payloads and other commercial spacecraft, the New Glenn, nearly 10 years after Bezos announced the project, is expected to be a viable alternative.",
      "Mounted atop pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the 321-foot-tall rocket is scheduled for blast off at 1 a.m. EST Monday, the opening of a three-hour window. Blue Origin had hoped to launch the rocket Friday, then Sunday, but both opportunities were ruled out due to rough seas in the booster landing zone.",
      "Mission managers expect better weather Monday.",
      "Like SpaceX's Falcon rockets, the first stage of the New Glenn, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines generating a combined 3.8 million pounds of thrust, was designed to be reusable.",
      "After boosting the rocket's upper stage out of the lower atmosphere three minutes and 10 seconds after launch, the 188-foot-tall first stage will separate and attempt to land on a 380-foot-long custom-built ship named after Bezos' mother, Jacklyn, that will be stationed downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "From launch to touchdown: nine minutes and 28 seconds. While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin is making the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. Appropriately enough, the company named the booster \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "While the 23-foot-wide first stage is powered by liquified natural gas, the 88-foot-tall upper stage is equipped with two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines that generate a combined 320,000 pounds of thrust. They can be restarted in space up to three times over 16 hours, enabling the stage to place payloads in especially demanding orbits.",
      "The New Glenn's carbon-composite nose fairing, which encapsulates payloads during the climb to space, provides 16,184 cubic feet of volume, large enough to house an entire New Shepard rocket, the booster Blue Origin uses to launch space tourists\u00a0on sub-orbital flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "For its maiden flight, the New Glenn will carry a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as Blue Ring, a sort of space tug that can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing onboard computer support and even servicing.",
      "The flight plan calls for the upper stage and the attached Blue Ring test vehicle to reach an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles. The mission is expected to last five hours and 50 minutes from start to finish.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet, with 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other payloads weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck. There are no such payloads on the initial \"pathfinder\" flight, but the spacecraft will be thoroughly checked out in orbit.",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and now dominates the global commercial launch market, firing off 134 Falcon-family rockets last year and five so far in 2025. SpaceX has successfully recovered first stage boosters 395 times.",
      "SpaceX also is building a gargantuan new rocket -- the Super Heavy-Starship -- with a seventh test flight on tap as early as Monday from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, launch site. A variant of the rocket's Starship upper stage is being built for NASA to carry astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface as part of the Artemis program.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019 with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "Amazon plans its own fleet of more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper. The company says it has booked up to 95 launches with Blue Origin, the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"Once deployed, the Kuiper System will serve individual households, as well as schools, hospitals, businesses, disaster relief efforts, government agencies and other organizations operating in places without reliable broadband,\" Amazon says on its website.",
      "Whether Amazon can succeed against SpaceX in the space-based internet services market remains to be seen. But Blue Origin's New Glenn will provide an alternative to SpaceX when it comes to launch services.",
      "The rocket was designed from the ground up to be \"human rated,\" enabling astronaut flights at some point in the future. If successful, the rocket will eventually be used to launch NASA space probes, classified military payloads, commercial satellites, lunar cargo ships and even piloted moon landers for NASA.",
      "\"The New Glenn rocket is all about significantly reducing the cost of access to space,\" said Syracuse University professor and former NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. \"This will give SpaceX some serious competition. ... These are exciting times in the space business.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",

      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",

But the posts weren't removed outright, according to Meta. What does get removed are severe content violations like posts supporting terrorism or promoting child sexual exploitation.",

    "summary": "Bankruptcy comes days after scathing Senate report on private equity impact on hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "A Los Angeles-based company that owns more than a dozen hospitals in four states filed for bankruptcy late Saturday night, the second major system acquired by private equity to collapse in less than a year.",
      "In an initial filing seeking Chapter 11 protections, Prospect Medical Holdings, which owns facilities in California, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, listed debts of more than $400 million. In a press release announcing its restructuring, the company said it would continue to operate as normal.",
      "\"Throughout the Cchapter 11 process, Prospect Holdings' hospitals, medical centers, and physicians' offices will remain open, and patient care and services will continue uninterrupted,\" the company wrote.",
      "Prospect Medical bankruptcy comes less than after the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care, another major hospital system once-backed by private equity.\u00a0 CBS News documented how Steward, along with private equity investors, extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from before that company, potentially leading to shortages of life-saving medical equipment.",
      "Along with Steward, Prospect Medical has been a one focus of an ongoing CBS News investigation revealing how private equity investors have siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from community hospitals with devastating public health consequences.",
      "From 2010 to 2021, private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners controlled a majority stake in Prospect Medical. CBS News has reported on a series of financial moves the company took to issue leadership a $457 million dividend in 2018. Prospect Medical's CEO Sam Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid $257 million.",
      "Among the similarities between Prospect Medical and Steward\u2013 both companies sold off the land and buildings to a real estate investment firm prior to its executives issuing themselves large payouts. The transactions resulted in onerous lease agreements that diverted funds away from direct patient care.",
      "Last week, a powerful, bipartisan Senate committee found what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" as Leonard Green and Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, causing hospitals serving vulnerable communities to cut services or close altogether. The Senate committee's findings were part of a 162-page report report that concluded private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "Both Prospect Medical and Leonard Green disputed the findings by Senate investigators.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",

    "story": [
      "An investigation is underway to find the operator of a private drone that collided with a firefighting aircraft battling the blazes in Los Angeles on Thursday, the FBI said.",
      "The unauthorized drone damaged the aircraft, known as a \"super scooper,\" as it was working to suppress the massive Palisades Fire that has so far engulfed more than 23,000 acres of land in western L.A. County.",
      "Laura Eimiller, a spokesperson for the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said in a statement to CBS News on Sunday that the drone violated temporary flight restrictions enacted by the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the blazes.",
      "The restrictions are set to remain in place through Jan. 25 and currently apply to areas around the Palisades Fire and Eaton Fire, which has scorched at least 14,000 acres as of Sunday. Providing \"a safe environment for firefighting aviation operations\" is the purpose of those temporary orders, the FAA said.",
      "The super scooper was able to land safely after being hit on Thursday, said Eimiller, although the drone left a 3-by-6-inch hole in the aircraft's left wing. Authorities were able to recover parts of the drone, which was \"heavily damaged,\" after it crashed.",
      "\"While we have conducted a significant investigation working with our partners, we are seeking the public's help in order to identify the operator of the drone,\" Eimiller said.",
      "Officials have asked anyone with information about the person or group behind the drone collision to contact the FBI's Los Angeles office or submit tips through a dedicated line.",
      "California state officials said there have been at least 40 incidents where unauthorized drones have forced firefighters to pause air operations since the wildfires broke out last week. Crews battling the blazes have used air tankers to dump thousands of gallons of flame retardant, and super scoopers, as well as helicopters, to drop water over the blazes.",
      "\"When people fly drones near wildfires, fire response agencies often ground their aircraft to avoid the potential for a midair collision,\" the FAA writes on its website. \"Delaying airborne response poses a threat to firefighters on the ground, residents, and property in nearby communities, and it can allow wildfires to grow larger.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:51:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The first congestion pricing plan in the U.S. has begun, charging most drivers $9 a day to enter the lower half of Manhattan. The long-debated plan is projected to raise up to $800 million a year for the city's aging public transit system. Will it work?",
    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",
      "Fourteen hundred cameras keep tabs on the roughly 150,000 commuters entering the zone by car.",
      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",
      "New Jersey drivers were none too happy; they already pay more than $15 in bridge and tunnel tolls to get into the city.",
      "Singapore began congestion pricing in 1975, and Stockholm in 2006. But New York based its plan on London's, which rolled out in 2003.",
      "Opponents in New York say this is just a cash grab \u2013 another tax that will hurt mainly working people.",

      "What to know about New York City's new congestion pricing program",
      "\"Congestion Pricing\" passes in New York as other states consider the plan for themselves",
      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here. And I think having New York be a more productive city, I think he'll appreciate it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Andrea Pasinetti was in San Francisco for work and his wife, Sixuan, was overseas when the Palisades Fire broke out on Tuesday, devastating neighborhood after neighborhood \u2014 including their own. Their dogsitter was stuck in the roads leading to their block, leaving the Pasinettis' three dogs waiting at home as the flames began ravaging their street, Lachman Lane.",
      "Bundled with anxiety and not knowing the fate of his beloved pets, Pasinetti said he jumped on a flight to Los Angeles, hoping to make it home in time to get Alma, Archie and Hugo out of danger.",
      "\"The flight into [Los Angeles] was definitely very, very hard because we just didn't have any information,\" he told CBS News from a hotel room.",
      "Pasinetti's friend picked him up with a car full of fire retardant materials and blankets, in case he would need them when rescuing the pets, and they sped over to the Palisades. But when they were about eight minutes out, Pasinetti said they struggled to find a way in with \"cops at most intersections.\"",
      "\"It's this feeling of helplessness and devastation and also just the unknown,\" he described. \"Wanting to maintain hope, but also kind of bracing for the worst.\"",
      "While on the phone with his wife, Pasinetti said he determined there were two options they could move forward with \u2014 either he finds a way to the house, or someone else needs to. That's when Sixuan saw CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti reporting from Palisades Charter High School, which was a short distance from their residence.",
      "\"We started wracking our brains to see if we knew anyone who might be able to get in touch with Jonathan, and we were tweeting at him and eventually we found a friend and sort of colleague of his, who was able to get a message through,\" Pasinetti said.",
      "That colleague was CBS News producer Christian Duran, and the two-man team decided to help, heading over to the house that was \"on its last legs,\" according to Pasinetti \u2014 despite the risk involved.",
      "\"We knew it was a tall order to extract all three dogs from the house,\" he said. \"Obviously, Jonathan didn't have a key to the house, so I told him to break whatever window he could and he managed to get into the house.\"",
      "Alma, Archie and Hugo are rescue dogs, and as a result, \"pre-wired with a lot of anxiety,\" Pasinetti explained. The three of them were likely in separate areas of the house \u2014 with Alma right at the entrance and Hugo likely under a bed, he said, potentially making the rescue even more difficult.",
      "\"They managed to wrangle [Alma] somehow and I think they threw a blanket over her and kind of got her covered, then they proceeded to the second pup, Archie,\" he said. \"I imagine they had to lift the bed in the primary bedroom and extract Hugo.\"",
      "\"The circumstance probably couldn't have been any more dramatic. The house was surrounded by flames,\" Pasinetti continued. \"I think it burned down a few hours after he was able to get the pups.\"",
      "Pasinetti said he was almost in disbelief when he found out all three had been rescued from the house safely.",
      "\"I have never felt that mixture of joy and relief and exhaustion and despair and gratitude towards someone,\" he said. \"The generosity and kindness and risk that they put themselves through to get the dogs was really \u2014 I think it's the best that humanity has to offer.\"",
      "The Pasinettis still have a long road ahead \u2014 picking up the pieces of a lost home, something they haven't even had an opportunity to comprehend yet, he said. The Palisades Fire has destroyed nearly 23,000 acres and continues to burn with little containment.",
      "Pasinetti added that the experience has reminded them about what's important in life.",
      "\"I think we go through life accruing so much stuff and curating our belongings, but at the end of the day, it's all stuff \u2014 and while it's sad to lose, I think the possibility and prospect of losing something much more important, just put it into perspective,\" he shared.",
      "Pasinetti also emphasized he was grateful for the efforts that first responders and firefighters had been tirelessly putting in to save lives and homes. One firefighter even offered to take him to his home that night amidst the chaos, he said.",
      "\"I think all the plaudits and all the commentary on the firefighters and the first responders really, really is very much deserved and they put themselves in harm's way to try to save what they could,\" he said. \"They were sort of in the line of fire, literally, for many hours and days often without water.\"",

      "But former prosecutor Lisa Andrews says it is not certain that only two shots struck her. The medical examiner thought it was possible Patricia's wounds were the result of three shots \u2014 one to the left chest, one to the right arm, and a third to her right chest.",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",

      "CBS News recently reported Smith would resign from the Justice Department after completing his work.",
      "According to court documents, Smith \"separated from the Department on January 10.\" The revelation was made in a federal court filing amid an ongoing dispute between Justice Department officials and defense attorneys tied to the president-elect over the release of one volume of Smith's two-volume report.",
      "Attorneys for Trump's former codefendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira have sought to extend an order by Judge Aileen Cannon barring the Justice Department from releasing a portion of Smith's report.",
      "Regulations require special counsels to submit a report to the attorney general detailing their investigative findings and prosecutorial decisions. Garland has pledged to release to the public all reports completed under his tenure and has so far done so, including after an investigation into President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Court filings earlier this week revealed Smith had submitted a two-volume report to Garland on Jan. 7, just days after attorneys for Trump and his codefendants reviewed a draft report. Trump's attorneys subsequently wrote a letter to Garland asking him to remove Smith from his post and prevent the release of the report, according to court filings.",
      "Following the review, attorneys for Trump's codefendants asked Cannon, who initially dismissed one of Smith's cases against Trump in July, and judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to stop Garland from releasing the report.",
      "Smith was appointed in November of 2022 to take over two Justice Department investigations into Trump, one related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and another tied to his handling of classified records after he left office. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Trump. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Smith's dual cases against Trump were ultimately closed last year after Trump won the presidential election. Prosecutors wrote that Justice Department regulations forbid the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The special counsel at the time opted to keep an appeal of Cannon's dismissal of the classified documents investigation open in the cases of Nauta and de Oliveira. It was in this case that their attorneys sought to prevent the release of the report, arguing doing so would prejudice their case.",
      "In response, the Justice Department revealed the attorney general would not release the volume of the report dealing with the classified documents probe until the case is completely closed, and instead make it available to a select group of members of Congress.",
      "Still, the defense attorneys and Trump's legal team have urged the federal courts to stop the release of the other portion of the report detailing Smith's probe into the 2020 election.",
      "Right now, the report remains unreleased after Cannon ordered the Justice Department to keep the report under wraps until at least Sunday. Judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump codefendants' bid to further enjoin prosecutors from releasing the report.",

    "story": [
      "The company behind Los Angeles' emergency alert technology said it has added safeguards to prevent further inaccurate wildfire evacuation alerts from being sent to residents amid deadly, devastating wildfires.",
      "The first erroneous alert was sent on Thursday. It was meant for people near the Kenneth Fire, but was instead sent to all 10 million residents of Los Angeles County, sparking panic. Some residents received a follow-up message telling them to \"disregard\" the inaccurate alert. Other erroneous alerts telling people to evacuate when they weren't in fire zones were reported later Thursday and on Friday. City officials said they were investigating the issue and are determined to get to the bottom of it.",
      "Genasys, the company that provides the alert technology to the county, said it has \"not been able to replicate this error.\" The company also said it has \"added safeguards into the software to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "How do Genasys emergency alerts work?",
      "When wildfires ignite, it is local emergency managers and law enforcement that send evacuation alerts to a community. Genasys' algorithm draws \"alert polygons\" that determine who gets the message.",
      "\"If you're in the polygon, you're going to get an alert,\" said Genasys' Lisa Bernard.",
      "To make those polygons, the algorithm considers things like population density, hazard areas and how people can get out. Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management Director Kevin McGowan said Friday that the alerts are sent automatically, and emphasized that there isn't a person sitting at a desk sending the alerts.",
      "\"Having those predefined areas really speeds up that process of defining the area that's being evacuated and then communicating that out to the public,\" Bernard explained.",
      "Those areas can be extremely targeted. Sometimes, the algorithm can alert one side of the street and not the other because of the conditions. That happened on Wednesday when the Eaton fire approached a polygon in the Pasadena area. That can happen because of natural fire breaks, like if one side of the street is lined with homes backed against a tree-covered hillside, and the other side is concrete parking lots.",
      "Los Angeles officials said Friday that varying factors, including where a phone is registered, may have affected who received the message.",

He explained, \"If the United States is not engaged, if we're not leading, then probably either someone else is (and probably not in a way that reflects our interests and our values), or maybe just as bad, no one is. What we've done over the last four years is, we've re-engaged.\"",
      "As for Ukraine, he told the press in Brussels, \"All told, the U.S. has provided $102 billion in assistance to Ukraine, our allies and partners $158 billion. This may be the best example of burden-sharing that I've seen in the 32 years that I've been doing this.\"",
      "President-elect Trump wants to end Russia's war with Ukraine, critics fear not to Ukraine's advantage. Ever the diplomat, Blinken won't say he's trying to Trump-proof the potential outcome. \"For any of us to really speculate at this point, I don't think makes a lot of sense,\" Blinken said. \"What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it's on Ukraine or anything else.\"",
      "Sixty-two years old, Antony Blinken was practically born to be secretary of state.\u00a0 His father, financier and philanthropist Donald Blinken, served as ambassador to Hungary. His stepfather, international lawyer and humanitarian Samuel Pisar, was a Holocaust survivor from Poland. \"He was on a death march out of the camps, and he and some friends managed to escape the death march itself, hid out in the Bavarian woods,\" Blinken said. \"They saw a tank with a five-pointed white star. And the hatch opened up, and a very large African American GI looked down at him, and he got down on his knees and said the only words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war: 'God bless America.' And the GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into the United States. Those are the stories that I grew up hearing, and it made me feel that there was something special about our country.\"",
      "Blinken grew up in Paris. He went to Harvard, Columbia Law School, and in 1993, during President Clinton's first term, began his diplomatic career at the State Department. During one administration after another, Blinken was always in \"the room where it happens.\" There he was (right, background) in the famous picture when President Obama took out Osama bin Laden.",
      "Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. The two are exceptionally close. \"One of the things that's been an immense privilege is to have the kind of relationship where he would seek my counsel,\" said Blinken, \"and I always felt with him the ability to speak my mind.\"",
      "It was reported in Bob Woodward's recent book, \"War,\" that after President Biden's shaky debate performance last July, Blinken met with the president and asked him to consider whether he \"wanted to be doing this another four years?\"... adding, \"I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized.\"",
      "Blinken and Biden's legacies are inevitably linked, for better or worse. Blinken has defended the chaotic U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan on their watch, reminding the world that the first Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban, forcing the withdrawal.",
      "On their rocky relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the devastation of Gaza, in response to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the appearance that Netanyahu is not respecting the role that the United States is trying to play (and has helped to finance) in its support of Israel, that calls to protect and feed people have been ignored, Blinken said this: \"The quickest way, the most effective way to get people what they need is actually through what we've been trying to achieve for many months now, and that's a ceasefire, with the hostages coming home, massive assistance going in.\"",
      "Even this late in the game, Blinken is hoping a deal can be reached before Inauguration Day. But if not? He said, \"When that agreement is reached, it will be on the basis of what President Biden put forward.\"",
      "And who will get the credit? \"You know, ultimately, it doesn't matter,\" Blinken said. \"What really matters is whether the United States can bring real change, real change to people's lives.\"",
      "He still sounds idealistic. There's something a bit square about Antony Blinken. After all, he's the guy who promoted music diplomacy by performing the Muddy Waters blues standard, \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" in a suit and tie:",
      "What will he do now? He's vague on that. As he left NATO headquarters for the last time as secretary of state, I asked, \"You can't not have strong feelings knowing that you're leaving this building?\"",
      "\"Sure,\" Blinken said. \"Look, there'll always be a moment. Someone says something to you, there's some generous recognition, and for about 30 seconds you feel that. You take it to heart. But then, it's back to work. That really is my focus. Now, talk to me on January 21.\"",

      "\"This area particularly, you know, I've lived here for over 20 years and it's just, slowly getting, like, soulless. I would say 50% of the buildings are here just for temporary use, you know, for rentals,\" he said.",

      "Barcelona's City Hall has launched a program to install energy efficient heat pumps and solar panels in all of the city's 170 public schools over six years.

    "summary": "Greenland's prime minister said he hasn't spoken to President-elect Donald Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what \"unites us.\"",
    "story": [
      "Greenland's prime minister said Friday that the mineral-rich Arctic territory's people don't want to be Americans, but that he understands U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's interest in the island given its strategic location and he's open to greater cooperation with Washington.",
      "The comments from the Greenlandic leader, M\u00fate B. Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland \u2014 a semiautonomous territory of Denmark \u2014 a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S. Melting sea ice has\u00a0opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic, and Western powers have\u00a0already voiced concern about\u00a0Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "Egede acknowledged that Greenland is part of the North American continent, and \"a place that the Americans see as part of their world.\" He said he hasn't spoken to Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what \"unites us.\"",
      "\"Cooperation is about dialogue. Cooperation means that you will work towards solutions,\" he said.",
      "Egede has been calling for independence for Greenland, casting Denmark as a colonial power that hasn't always treated the Indigenous Inuit population well.",
      "\"Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic,\" he said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen.",
      "Trump's desire for Greenland has sparked anxiety in Denmark as well as across Europe. The United States is a strong ally of 27-nation European Union and the leading member of the NATO alliance, and many Europeans were shocked by the suggestion that an incoming U.S. leader could even consider using force against an ally.",
      "But Frederiksen said that she sees a positive aspect in the discussion.",
      "\"The debate on Greenlandic independence and the latest announcements from the U.S. show us the large interest in Greenland,\" she said. \"Events which set in motion a lot of thoughts and feelings with many in Greenland and Denmark.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our closest ally, and we will do everything to continue a strong cooperation,\" she said.",
      "Frederiksen and Egede spoke to journalists after a biannual assembly of Denmark and two territories of its kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The meeting had been previously scheduled and wasn't called in response to Trump's recent remarks. Trump's eldest son also made a visit to Greenland on Tuesday, landing in a plane emblazoned with the word TRUMP and handing out Make America Great Again caps to locals.",
      "The Danish public broadcaster, DR, reported Friday that Trump's team encouraged homeless and socially disadvantaged people in Greenland to appear in a video wearing the MAGA hats after being offered a free meal in a nice restaurant. The report quoted a local resident, Tom Amtof, who recognized some of those in a video broadcast by Trump's team.",
      "\"They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,\" he said.",
      "Greenland has a population of 57,000. But it's a vast territory possessing natural resources that include oil, gas, and rare earth elements, which are expected to become more accessible as ice melts because of climate change.

      "Caracas \u2014 Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, in power since 2013, was sworn in for a third six-year term on Friday despite a global outcry that brought thousands out in protest on the eve of the ceremony.",
      "Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who came out of hiding to lead a demonstration in Caracas on Thursday, was briefly detained after the rally according to her team, reigniting international condemnation of Maduro's alleged vote steal and cowing of critics.",
      "The government denied arresting Machado, but the vocal critic of Maduro was\u00a0detained by security forces who intercepted her\u00a0convoy following an anti-government rally in Caracas, her team said. Witnesses reported gunfire as her motorcycle was forced off the road and she was forcibly taken away.",
      "Standing before officials on Friday, Maduro was sworn in at Venezuela's legislative palace.",
      "\"I swear by Bolivar, by Sucre, by Urdaneta, by Manuela Saez, by the eternal memory of our eternal commander Hugo Chavez ... I swear by history, I swear by my life,\" Maduro said.",
      "In a fiery speech following his swearing-in, Maduro accused external powers of \"attacking\" Venezuela, taking digs at the U.S. government and foreign critics, and he promised to guarantee \"peace and national sovereignty.\"",
      "\"Today more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\" he said. \"I have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\"",
      "Trump, other world leaders react to Machado's detention",
      "In a social media post, President-elect Donald Trump branded Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia \u2014 the man who took her place on the ballot and is widely accepted to have beaten Maduro in elections on July 28 \u2014 as \"freedom fighters.\"",
      "They \"should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE,\" he wrote on his Truth Social network.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump tightened punitive measures against the Maduro government for anti-democratic actions. The sanctions were partly lifted, then reimposed, by his successor President Biden, and may well be hardened during Trump's next term, which begins in just 10 days.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a post on X that the U.S. stands \"ready to support a return to democracy in Venezuela.\"",
      "\"The Venezuelan people and world know that Nicolas Maduro clearly lost the 2024 presidential election and has no right to claim the presidency today,\" Blinken said.",
      "Ecuador denounced what it called the Maduro \"dictatorship,\" while Spain expressed \"total condemnation\" of Machado's detention, albeit brief.",
      "Colombia, whose leftist President Gustavo Petro is historically an ally of Maduro, also condemned the \"systematic harassment\" of Machado, 57.",
      "Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Friday denounced \"another unacceptable act of repression\" in Venezuela, without mentioning Machado specifically.",
      "\"The news coming from Venezuela represents another unacceptable act of repression by the Maduro regime, whose proclaimed electoral victory we do not recognize,\" Meloni said in a statement. \"We intend to continue working for a democratic and peaceful transition.

      "The United Nations voiced alarm this week at reports of arbitrary detention and intimidation.",
      "More than 2,400 people were arrested, 28 killed and about 200 injured in protests that met Maduro's claim of election victory last year. He has since maintained a fragile peace through massive military and police deployments and with the help of paramilitary \"colectivos\" \u2014 armed civilian volunteers accused of quelling protests through a reign of neighborhood terror.",
      "Former diplomat Gonzalez Urrutia, 75, had voiced tentative plans to fly to Caracas this week to take power, but the plan is deemed unlikely to go ahead.",
      "\"Wanted\" posters offering a $100,000 government reward for his capture have been plastered all over Caracas.",
      "Gonzalez Urrutia has been on an international tour seeking to pile pressure on Maduro, 62, to relinquish power. It has included a stop in Washington to meet Mr. Biden, who called for a \"peaceful transfer back to democratic rule.\"",
      "Maduro has been in power since 2013, following the death of left-wing firebrand Hugo Chavez, his political mentor. His re-election in 2018 was also widely rejected as fraudulent but he managed to cling to power through a mix of populism and repression, even as the economy imploded.",
      "Maduro enjoys support from Russia and Cuba, as well as a loyal military, judges and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.",
      "Thousands of ruling party loyalists held a rival demonstration in central Caracas on Thursday, vowing to prevent any attempt to thwart Maduro's return to office.",
      "Sanctions against Venezuela",
      "In response to Maduro taking office for a third term on Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Israeli military strikes killed more than 600 people in the Gaza Strip in the first 10 days of 2025, pushing the death toll over 46,000 since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry, and one new estimate suggests it could be much higher. Israel launched the war after Hamas carried out its unprecedented terrorist attack, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "The total number of dead in Gaza represents a little more than 2% of the tiny enclave's population, with an average of about 3,000 people killed each month or 100 killed each day since Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel 15 months ago.",
      "Israel has rejected the figures provided by Palestinian officials and blames Hamas for all deaths in Gaza, accusing the group of using civilians as human shields. But new research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests the figure provided by the Gazan health ministry for the first nine months of the war could have been understated by as much as 40%.",
      "Gaza death toll an underestimate, Lancet study suggests",
      "From the beginning of the war through June 30, 2024, Gaza's heath ministry said just under 38,000 people had been killed by traumatic injuries, but the Lancet's estimate \u2014 published in a peer-reviewed study based on data from health authorities, social media obituaries and an online survey \u2014 was that more than 64,000 people had been killed during that time.",
      "CBS News is unable to independently verify the numbers, and Israeli authorities have prevented Western journalists from entering Gaza to report independently since the war started.",
      "The Lancet noted that its estimate does not include thousands more people still believed to be buried under rubble, or those who have died from a lack of access to food, water or medical care during the war.",
      "\"I am broken inside after losing my family,\" 21-year-old Mahmoud Sukkar told CBS News' local team in Gaza. All 17 members of his family were killed, including his mother, father and twin brother, when an Israeli strike hit their home in Gaza City in the first month of the war.",
      "Sukkar, the only survivor, now lives alone in a tent camp in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.",
      "\"I don't have any wishes,\" Sukkar said. \"I want to visit my family's graves. My only wish is to visit their graves.\"",
      "Israel continues attacking Houthis in Yemen",
      "As Israel continues its strikes against the remnants of Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces said Friday that its naval and air forces had struck multiple Houthi rebel targets on Yemen's west coast and inland, including ports and a power station.",
      "The Houthis, like Hamas, are backed by Iran, and they've launched repeated missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. and Israeli military vessels and Israeli territory in support of their allies since the war in Gaza began. The U.S. has also carried out many strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen over the last year.",
      "\"The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world,\" said the IDF in a statement.",
      "\"As we promised \u2014 the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a separate statement.",
      "Progress, but no breakthroughs in ceasefire talks",
      "Iin Doha, Qatar, meanwhile, American and Arab negotiators have made \"real progress\" this week toward a deal between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage release in the waning days of the Biden administration, the U.S. president said Thursday, but it has not appeared sufficient for any major breakthrough to be announced, or to warrant higher-level officials flying back to the region.",
      "\"We're making some real progress, I met with negotiators today,\" Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange right now, but I think we may be able to get that done, we need to get it done.\"",
      "U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk had been working to hammer out the technical details of a proposal, but Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea did not fly to Doha this week as Israeli media had said he might, and there was no indication that CIA chief William Burns was in Qatar, either. Both men have joined the talks repeatedly when there's been hope of a potential agreement.",
      "One apparent sticking point in the talks has been the unconfirmed condition of 34 Israeli hostages in Gaza who were listed on a document that Hamas resurfaced this week after it first emerged last summer. Israel has demanded to know who on the list is still alive and who is dead. Hamas demanded a four-day ceasefire to contact its network of militants across Gaza to confirm the hostages' condition, saying Israel's ongoing operations made it impossible for the group to assess otherwise.",
      "Family members and friends of the hostages have protested regularly in Israel to demand that Netanyahu's government strike a deal to bring them all home at the same time. Israeli officials believe about 100 hostages are still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza, though at least 30 are believed to be dead.",
      "If a ceasefire does take shape, the first phase would involve a swap of hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, along with a surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza.",
      "But another major hurdle is Hamas' consistent demand that Israeli forces completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip \u2014 something Israel has thus far refused to accept.",
      "Some Israelis and Palestinians hope for \"help from Donald Trump\"",
      "If a deal is not achieved by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, some Israelis \u2014 and Palestinians \u2014 hope he will bring a needed change to the negotiations, potentially for the better.",
      "\"He is unpredictable and he is brave,\" Ilay David, brother of 24-year-old hostage Eyvatar David, told CBS News at a rally in Jerusalem on Friday afternoon. \"We have to think out of the box, and Trump can bring that change.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is known for being mostly a businessman,\" said 19-year-old Palestinian cybersecurity student Ameen Abu Fkheida at Birzeit University in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"I don't think he will be a friend [of Palestinians], but I do think there will be some sort of help from Donald Trump regarding the case of Gaza, which could probably be a ceasefire or an exchange of prisoners or something to deescalate the current situation in Gaza.\"",

      "Berlin\u00a0\u2014 Poland's government adopted a resolution on Thursday that would enable Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attend events in the country later this month to mark 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz Nazi death camp without facing the risk of arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant. It was presented as a largely symbolic policy, as Netanyahu is not expected to attend the event.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the move by his government, which doesn't refer directly to Netanyahu or the ICC arrest warrant against him, but rather issues a blanket guarantee of security to all senior Israeli officials to attend the Auschwitz memorial service.",
      "Tusk told reporters Thursday that, per information from the Israeli embassy in Warsaw, Israel plans to send its education minister to represent the nation at the 80th commemoration of the Auschwitz liberation, so the resolution could be considered a \"political demonstration.\"",
      "\"I confirm, whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister \u2014 as it is currently declared \u2014 of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained,\" Tusk said.",
      "President Andrzej Duda had called for a special exemption to let Netanyahu visit Poland for the Auschwitz memorial service, which will take place eight decades after Allied forces seized the notorious death camp from German troops and liberated the surviving prisoners on January 27, 1945. Duda had sent a letter to Tusk urging an exemption for Netanyahu, who's attend the annual event several times previously, according to a statement confirmed by the Polish president's office.",
      "Duda highlighted the significance of the 80th Auschwitz memorial service, saying any representatives from Israel, particularly those in leadership positions, should be able to participate without legal obstacles.",
      "The ICC issued arrest warrants in November for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas leader Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and the war in Gaza that followed.",
      "Israel's government has vociferously rejected the indictment of its leader as a miscarriage of justice, insisting that it has remained within its rights to self-defense in carrying out the war against Hamas.",
      "As a signatory nation to the United Nations treaty that established the ICC, Poland is obligated to detain any individual with an outstanding warrant issued by the court if they enter its territory.",
      "Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski had already dismissed speculation about any potential arrest of the Israeli leader, saying Netanyahu was not expected to visit Europe anyway.",
      "The issue came up amid strained relations between Duda, Poland's conservative, nationalist leader, and Tusk's centrist, pro-European administration, which took office in December 2023.",
      "In Poland, the president is the country's top official, and the person in the role has the power to veto legislation brought by the government, which is led by the prime minister, but a presidential veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the parliament.",
      "Auschwitz, constructed by the Nazi regime in occupied Poland, became a powerful symbol of the atrocities of the Holocaust.",
      "More than 1.1 million people, primarily Jews, were killed through forced labor, starvation, disease and mass executions in gas chambers at Auschwitz before it was liberated. Poland's Jewish population was decimated, with more than three million killed during World War II, accounting for nearly half of all Holocaust victims.",

      "Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting of about 50 allies at the American military's Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the last such gathering before Trump takes office on January 20. His imminent return to the White House has cast doubt on future American support for Ukraine's war effort, given previous favorable remarks about Russia's authoritarian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's vow to quickly end the war nearly three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "While he's offered no clear indication as to how he intends to achieve that, many in Ukraine and across Europe are concerned Trump could make good on the promise by withholding aid to Ukraine and pushing Zelenskyy to negotiate a truce that lets Russia maintain control over some of the vast territory is has occupied in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.",
      "\"It's clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world \u2014 just 11 days from now, a time when we have to cooperate even more, rely on one another even more, and achieve even greater results together,\" said Zelenskyy, adding that he saw it \"as a time of opportunities.\"",

      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn't know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source's associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \"unparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\"",

      "\"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa \u2014 who U.S. prosecutors say is a leader of Japan's notorious Yakuza mafia \u2014 told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \"ethnic insurgent group\" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \"the isotope composition of the plutonium\" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "Last year, prosecutors posted photos of the purported nuclear materials allegedly sent by Ebisawa.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Ebisawa conspired to sell 500 kilograms of methamphetamine and 500 kilograms of heroin to an undercover agent to be distributed in New York. He also allegedly worked to launder $100,000 in purported narcotics proceeds from the U.S. to Japan.",
      "\"As he admitted in federal court today, Takeshi Ebisawa brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York. \"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma and laundered what he believed to be drug money from New York to Tokyo.\"",

It attributed the decline largely to legislation passed to combat organized crime that includes measures like barring members of designated groups from opening bank accounts, renting apartments, buying cell phones or insurance.",

      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",

      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",

      "Approximately 15.5 million U.S. adults are currently diagnosed with ADHD, according to CDC data. (iStock)",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with multiple mental health experts, who identified the most common signs and symptoms of ADHD in adults.",
      "1. Impulsive behaviors",
      "Adults with ADHD have difficulty managing impulsivity, according to Zo\u00eb Kahn, a licensed psychotherapist and ADHD therapist in Pasadena, California.",
      "\"This can look like blurting out answers in a classroom setting, interrupting in conversation and difficulty thinking through the long-term consequences of choices,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD AFFECTS 1 IN 9 KIDS IN US, NEW REPORT REVEALS: \u2018SHAME AND STIGMA\u2019",
      "Impulsivity can also lead to making snap decisions without considering long-term consequences, Anderson added.",
      "\"It might also manifest subtly, like overspending on impulse purchases or having trouble waiting your turn in group discussions,\" she said.",
      "2. Difficulty focusing or staying on task",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, Anderson noted.",
      "\"You might struggle to start tasks, even when vital, or abandon them halfway through,\" she said. \"You might jump between tasks without finishing anything or focus on smaller, less urgent tasks while the bigger, more critical ones remain untouched.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a persistent challenge that affects work, relationships and daily responsibilities.\"",
      "It's not about laziness, Anderson noted, but about feeling overwhelmed by what needs to be done.",
      "\"ADHD-related daydreaming is persistent and often disruptive, especially when it happens during crucial tasks or conversations,\" she said.",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, experts said. (iStock)",
      "\"This isn\u2019t just about occasionally zoning out during a long meeting \u2014 it\u2019s a persistent challenge that affects work, relationships and daily responsibilities.\"",
      "3. Trouble with time management",
      "People with ADHD may struggle to manage their schedules, often underestimating how long it will take to complete a project or reach a destination.",
      "\"Deadlines might sneak up on you, or you might feel perpetually behind on tasks, no matter how early you started,\" Anderson told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS",
      "\"This can create a constant cycle of stress and underachievement, leaving you feeling frustrated with yourself.\"",
      "4. Mental fatigue",
      "Mental fatigue and burnout are widespread in individuals with ADHD, according to Anderson.",
      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track,\" she said.",
      "\"ADHD-related daydreaming is persistent and often disruptive, especially when it happens during crucial tasks or conversations.\" (iStock)",
      "\"This constant effort to stay focused and organized can leave you feeling drained, even after relatively short periods of productivity.\"",
      "5. Forgetfulness",
      "Another sign of ADHD in adults is general disorganization, Kahn said, which can lead to an inability to follow through on tasks, meet important deadlines, pay bills on time or keep appointments.",
      "\"The ADHD brain often works in overdrive, juggling competing thoughts and struggling to stay on track.\"",
      "They may also find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys.",
      "\"Adults with ADHD have a hard time finding and keeping focus, which could look like not paying attention in conversation, missing key details, being easily distracted in certain settings, or even focusing on the wrong details,\" Kahn added.",
      "6. Inability to sit still",
      "People with ADHD often find themselves fidgeting and feeling generally restless, according to Dr. Michelle Dees, a board-certified psychiatrist at Luxury Psychiatry Clinic in Chicago.",
      "People with ADHD may find themselves misplacing important items, like car keys. (iStock)",
      "\"In adults, this may present as inner disquietude or incomplete calmness,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "Anderson reiterated this common symptom, noting that in children, it often takes the form of physical hyperactivity.",
      "DEPRESSION COULD BE PREVENTED WITH SPECIFIC DAILY STEP COUNT, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"It often transforms into internal restlessness in adults, where you feel like you can\u2019t fully relax or sit still without feeling jittery,\" she said. \"This constant sense of being \u2018on edge\u2019 can become exhausting over time.\"",
      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, which can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, according to Anderson. This can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.",
      "\"Many people with ADHD describe feeling like their emotions are more intense and more challenging to control than those of others around them,\" she added.",
      "When to seek help",
      "If you\u2019ve experienced several of the above signs and they interfere with your daily life, experts recommend seeking help.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"ADHD is not a flaw nor something to be ashamed of \u2014 it\u2019s simply a different way of processing information and interacting with the world,\" said Anderson.",
      "The first step is to speak with a health care professional specializing in ADHD, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or even your primary care physician, she suggested.",
      "\"They can provide a proper evaluation and help you explore treatment options, including therapy, medication or lifestyle adjustments,\" Anderson noted.",
      "Potential solutions include mindfulness exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help people with ADHD to improve their organization, time management and emotion regulation, the same source stated.",

      "It is important to be assessed by a psychiatrist or mental health clinician if you experience multiple ADHD symptoms, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "\"ADHD has overlapping symptoms with other disorders and is often comorbid with other diagnoses,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "As you seek out the right support and strategies, Anderson emphasizes the importance of being kind to yourself.",

      "But with opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado calling on Venezuelan citizens to join her on the streets to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be installed as the rightful president of Venezuela, the stage is now set for a confrontation with the Maduro regime.",

      "2. Freeze your credit: If your Social Security number or other sensitive details were compromised, consider placing a credit freeze with major credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This prevents potential identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.",

      "You can blame hackers for this breach, but PowerSchool shares the responsibility for failing to adequately protect sensitive data. The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion.

      "\"Priming\" is the insider term for telling a chatbot exactly what you want from it. With ChatGPT or any other, the more constraints you give, the better your answer. Examples: \"Limit your response to 250 words,\" \"Give me the list in bullet points,\" \"Format the results as a table,\" \"Use this data to create a bar chart.\"",
      "Remember, AI can\u2019t read your mind. It only knows what you tell it. Use \"do\" and \"don\u2019t\" in your prompts to get the results you want. Say you\u2019re cooking for friends, and some have allergies. Say, \"Create a recipe for six people. Do include protein, fruits, vegetables and carbs. Don\u2019t include dairy products, shellfish or nuts.\"",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",

      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

It charges your devices while you're chilling outdoors. What makes it special? Perovskite solar cells that are seriously impressive. These cells are about 30% more powerful than traditional solar cells in bright sunlight and perform twice as well in low light. The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler. So you could literally keep your drinks cold and your phone charged at the same time. While they haven't announced the price yet, you can expect to see this tech to hit stores sometime in spring or summer.",

The charging case is just 0.47 inches thick and is designed to stick to the back of your MagSafe-compatible phone. No more digging through bags or forgetting your earbuds at home.

These earbuds pack some serious battery power, up to 10 hours of listening time per charge and a total of 30 hours when you include the charging case. For those without MagSafe phones, Artronic promises \"adjustable options,\" but let's be real: The magnetic attachment is where the magic happens. Want to get your hands on these?

Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",
      "In some cases, developers themselves may unknowingly include data-gathering code as part of a monetization software development kit, which stealthily exfiltrates detailed browsing data. This makes it difficult to determine whether a compromise is the result of a hacking campaign or an intentional inclusion by the developer.",

      "1) Verify emails and links before clicking:\u00a0Many attacks begin with\u00a0phishing emails that impersonate trusted entities like Google Chrome Web Store Developer Support. These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Having strong antivirus software is an essential line of defense against malicious software. These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",

      "\"The helicopters can carry enough water to put out fires, of course, depending on the size of the fire. They also can saturate the ground to prevent fire from spreading.

      "Blinken made his rulings, he stated, because \"the RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians, have systematically murdered men and boys\u2014even infants\u2014on an ethnic basis, and (have) deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.\"",
      "The Secretary continued,\u00a0\"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "Blinken added that the African nation is suffering through \"a conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, leaving 638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan\u2019s recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead.\"",
      "Risch has held out that the situation in Sudan has been catastrophic for well over a year, and called into question the timing of Blinken\u2019s declaration. In a statement earlier this week, he wrote, \"It has been nearly a year since I introduced a resolution calling the atrocities in Sudan what they are: a genocide. Additionally, I first called for Global Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed against the RSF and Hemedti 263 days ago \u2013 and yet these sanctions still have not been leveraged.\"",

The U.S. already had sanctioned five RSF leaders, including two of Hemedti\u2019s brothers. We also determined in December 2023 that members of the RSF committed ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

      "Aides to Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was detained Thursday, followed moments later by official denials, in a confusing episode that capped a day of protests seeking to block President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from clinging to power.",
      "It's not clear exactly what transpired after Machado bid farewell to hundreds of supporters, hopped on a motorcycle and raced with her security convoy through the empty streets of eastern Caracas to an undisclosed location.",
      "At 3:21 p.m. local time, Machado\u2019s press team said in a social media post that security forces \"violently intercepted\" her convoy. Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",
      "THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS TAKE TO THE STREETS AHEAD OF MADURO'S THIRD INAUGURATION",
      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\"Of course, there\u2019s fewer people,\" said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \"There\u2019s fear.\"",
      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",

      "Negotiations to free the hostages are ongoing, after President-elect Trump vowed that there would be \"all hell to pay\" if the hostages are not released before he enters office. However, Levy's brother Or is reportedly not \"on the lists\" because he is a young man and therefore not considered a \"humanitarian case.\" Michael explained that his brother has a 3-year-old son who, after losing his mother on Oct. 7, has only his father left. \"If this is not a humanitarian case, I don\u2019t know what is,\" he said.",

      "He reportedly said his security forces had arrested\u00a0125 foreign mercenaries from 25 different countries who he claimed had entered the country with the intent \"to practice terrorism against the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the State Department flatly rejected Maduro\u2019s claims and told Fox News Digital, \"Any claims of U.S. involvement in a plot to overthrow Maduro are categorically false.\"",

      "Wildfires have decimated more than 37,000 acres of the Los Angeles metropolitan area over the last several days, charring more than 12,000 structures, displacing over 150,000 residents and leaving at least 16 people dead.",
      "On Tuesday, when the fires first started, the White House made federal disaster assistance available to the state of California to aid the state\u2019s recovery efforts. The disaster has also prompted an outpouring of donations from around the world.",
      "Follow along for live updates.",
      "As the fires rage on and as Los Angeles looks ahead toward an eventual recovery, here are ways you can most effectively help the city\u2019s recovery efforts.",
      "Long-term giving",
      "Patricia McIlreavy, the president and CEO of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, stressed that the Los Angeles community will need donations to last beyond the immediate aftermath of the wildfires. She compared the disaster relief to the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIn the early days, people would have said, well, we just need protective gear and we need a vaccine, and that\u2019s all we need. But as we went longer into that crisis, we had a much greater understanding that what everyone needed to move on from Covid was so different,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some people, it was child care. For others, it was elderly care. For some it was, you know, their children were falling behind in school. It varied in so many ways, what we all need it to kind of move beyond.\u201d",
      "McIlreavy encouraged donating to organizations focused on preventing\u00a0the Los Angeles community from falling behind due to the devastation, in addition to those providing immediate, lifesaving resources.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a warm meal and access to a pantry and kitchen of your own? A warm meal is great. It\u2019s wonderful to be provided a warm meal after your family has suffered a disaster. But access to a kitchen, access to being able to prepare your own meal, to feed your children with food, and in a way, and in a time that you choose, that\u2019s about dignity, that\u2019s about agency.\u201d",
      "Be specific with your donation",
      "Brea Burkholz \u2014 a spokesperson for Direct Relief, a California-based nonprofit that provides medical resources for disaster recovery \u2014 cautioned against bringing\u00a0large bags of miscellaneous items directly to shelters. While doing so is well-intentioned, Burkholz said, Los Angeles shelters often lack the capacity to handle the sudden influx of donations.",
      "\u201cA lot of the time, the system can get overwhelmed with donations of clothing and the material things because they\u2019re not set up and they don\u2019t have the space to take all of that in,\u201d she said.",
      "Burkholz suggested people volunteer their time instead or assist specific families in need of particular items or housing.",
      "\u201cIf you can make a direct connection to a family who is in need, that is a much better approach, because you know exactly who it\u2019s going to and there\u2019s a place for it,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of these people who have been displaced, they don\u2019t have a space. They don\u2019t have a home.\u201d",
      "Wendy Escobedo, the emergency operations manager of food relief nonprofit World Central Kitchen, echoed Burkholz\u2019s sentiment.",
      "\u201cIn the beginning, it was just an influx of people bringing everything and anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to start focusing on really, \u2018You know what? What are the needs?\u2019\u201d",
      "Escobedo said the city\u2019s shelters are in need of more toiletries, including diapers, wipes, towels and hairbrushes.",
      "Beware of scammers",
      "At a press conference on Saturday, California officials warned Los Angeles about a surge of scammers taking advantage of the crisis.",
      "\u201cTo anybody who would take advantage of people for their greedy gain, who see dollar signs, I have a message for you: You will be held responsible,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. \u201cYou will be prosecuted.\u201d",
      "Experts advise doing thorough research before opening your wallet.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re saying that they can do something that trusted organizations can\u2019t do or won\u2019t commit to, there may well be a reason for that, and it isn\u2019t always that they\u2019re creative and ahead of the curve,\u201d McIlreavy said.",
      "Escobedo suggested people donate directly to organizations or shelters. World Central Kitchen, for example, only accepts donations through its website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not accepting donations in any other way, or from any other sources,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way, we should avoid any of those issues.\u201d",

The diner was a local staple dating back to 1955, and Rosenbluh first laid eyes on its charred husk this week through a Facebook video that was sent to him after the Eaton Fire swept through the area.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say [we\u2019re] exchanging one restaurant for another, but that\u2019s kind of how it\u2019s going to transpire,\u201d Rosenbluh recalled thinking on the 14-hour drive back to Altadena. \u201cWe literally just closed escrow on Tuesday when all this stuff started to go down.\u201d",

The region was free of stormy weather this week. The area near the Temescal Ridge Trail also appears to be free of power lines or transformers, which rules out another potential cause.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "That leaves the source of most wildfires: people. But was it a result of arson? Four experts interviewed by NBC News said it was a possibility, but they thought the fires were more likely not set on purpose.",
      "\u201cThis is what we call inaccessible, rugged terrain,\u201d said Rick Crawford, former battalion chief for the Los Angeles Fire Department. \u201cArsonists usually aren\u2019t going to go 500 feet off a trailhead through trees and brush, set a fire and then run away.\u201d",
      "Fires break out in the wooded areas on the edges of Los Angeles all the time \u2014 many of them caused unintentionally by homeless people.  The fires almost never grow into a destructive blaze due to the lack of high winds. The combination of ferocious winds and a parched landscape created ideal conditions for the fast-moving fires that have consumed large swaths of Los Angeles this week.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a gang of arsonists to go out there and be starting fires because nature is taking care of that for you,\u201d said Scott Fischer, a retired federal law enforcement arson investigator.",
      "\u201cThere are arsonists out there,\u201d he added, \u201cbut are there a band of arsonists running around Los Angeles right now? Not likely.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen you get a large fire event like this being experienced in Los Angeles, you sometimes trigger people to go out and light a fire,\u201d said Terry Taylor, a retired wildland fire investigator who now works as an instructor. \u201cIt\u2019s a copycat thing. ... It happens from time to time.\u201d",

      "Eaton Fire",
      "The Eaton Fire, the second largest to wreak havoc in Los Angeles, is not one of those likely to have been started by an arsonist, the experts say. It erupted Tuesday evening in an area east of Altadena where an array of high-voltage transmission lines hovers overhead.",
      "Given the area and weather conditions, the fire experts said their first thought was power lines. Whipping winds can cause the lines to slap together, shedding small balls of superhot molten metal.",
      "\u201cIf the ground is really dry and the wind is blowing and poof \u2014 you have a fire,\u201d said Ed Nordskog, a retired detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department who spent his career investigating arsonists.",
      "But that\u2019s just one potential scenario. It\u2019s also possible that it was started by a person operating a camping stove or a car or lawn mower that ejected a hot spark onto dry grass, Nordskog said.",
      "As for the possibility it was intentionally set, Nordskog said it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, these fires are not arson,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no data supporting winds bringing out arsonists.\u201d",

      "Identifying the cause of a fire is a highly specialized and painstaking endeavor, experts say.",
      "The first step is pinpointing where it began. Things like burn patterns and charred debris can provide crucial clues.",
      "Then comes the most detailed and labor-intensive part of the process. The investigators will lay out a grid at the scene, typically with string, and literally crawl around on their hands and knees in search of footprints or other clues.",
      "The investigators often use metal detectors and magnifying glasses or even binoculars to help with their search.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll go inch by inch by inch, and it will take hours,\u201d said Nordskog. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun.\u201d",
      "In the case of the Eaton Fire, the investigators are likely to use magnets to help them hunt for the tiny, melted pieces of metal that could have been shed by power lines if they slapped together. But the existence of the metal doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that\u2019s how the fire started, Nordskog said.",

It showed that the most common causes of wildfires from 1992 to 2020 were mishaps related to vehicles and other equipment.",
      "\u201cMore than 95% of these are human-ignited fires,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cArson is among the causes, but most human-caused fires are not intentional.\u201d",
      "\u2018The best players out there\u2019",
      "The prospect of arsonists torching Los Angeles gained traction on social media Thursday when a group of people in Woodland Hills detained a man they suspected of setting a trash fire. The man was arrested, but there was not enough probable cause to charge him with arson, police officials said Friday. He was arrested on a felony probation violation instead.",
      "In addition to the Palisades and Eaton fires, four others have burned across Los Angeles. The causes remain under investigation.",
      "A law enforcement task force has been set up to uncover what caused the fires. The local agencies involved \u2014 the Los Angeles Fire Department, Police Department and county Sheriff\u2019s Department, as well as Cal Fire \u2014 are considered to be among the most skilled in the country. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is leading the probe.",
      "\"Everything is absolutely on the table,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said at a Saturday press conference.",

      "The New England Patriots have hired former Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel as their head coach, the team announced Sunday.",
      "Vrabel, 49, went 54-45 in six seasons as the Titans\u2019 coach, plus a 2-3 record in the playoffs. He is also a former player for the Patriots, playing linebacker for the team from 2001-2008, winning three Super Bowls.",
      "Vrabel was hired to replace Jerod Mayo, another former New England linebacker, who was fired after only one season with the team. Mayo went 4-13 in his lone year at the helm.",
      "During the 2024 season, Vrabel was a coaching consultant for the Cleveland Browns before his contract expired on Dec. 30 in anticipation of possible head coaching interviews.",
      "Vrabel was a coveted coaching candidate during this year\u2019s hiring cycle. He interviewed with the New York Jets and Chicago Bears before ultimately agreeing to a deal with the Patriots.",
      "Vrabel had a successful start to his tenure in Tennessee. His teams posted winning records in each of his first four seasons and made the playoffs in three straight seasons from 2019 to 2021. Under Vrabel, the Titans made the AFC Championship Game after the 2019 season. In 2021, Tennessee was the No. 1 seed in the AFC and had a first-round bye.",
      "The Titans missed the playoffs in Vrabel\u2019s last two seasons, however, and their win total decreased from seven to six from 2022 to 2023. In his six years with the team, Tennessee had six different starting quarterbacks.",
      "Vrabel\u2019s coaching career began in college with the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2011. He made the jump to the NFL in 2014, joining the Houston Texans\u2019 defensive staff. He was defensive coordinator for one season in 2017 before taking the Titans job.",
      "As a player, Vrabel started his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1997 after the team selected him in the third round of that year\u2019s draft. He spent four years with the Steelers before joining New England as a free agent.",
      "Vrabel became a franchise legend during his eight seasons with the Patriots as one of the best players on a defense that played a major role in the early years of New England\u2019s dynasty. Vrabel was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2023.",
      "New England should offer a more stable quarterback situation for Vrabel in his second head coaching stop. The team selected Drake Maye in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, and he played well in his rookie season.",
      "In addition to Maye, the Patriots will have the fourth pick in the upcoming draft as well as over $130 million in cap space, per Spotrac."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department, officials said in a court\u00a0filing Saturday.",
      "The move was expected ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Smith\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in 2020 election interference is expected to be released soon. Trump has denied the allegations.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,\u201d a government court filing said in a footnote.",
      "The footnote was part of a Justice Department filing in which the government asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, not to extend a restriction that is temporarily blocking part of Smith\u2019s report from being released.",
      "Trump had been indicted on charges related to allegations that he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He had entered a not guilty plea before the case was dropped. The federal charges, brought by Smith, were dismissed after Trump was elected in 2024. The Justice Department has a long-standing policy not to prosecute a sitting president.",
      "Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland said at the time that appointing Smith was in \u201cthe public interest\u201d because Trump had announced his candidacy and Biden was also planning to run for a second term. Garland, who had been appointed by Biden, said in 2022 that his selection of Smith \u201cunderscores the Department\u2019s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters.\u201d",
      "Smith oversaw investigations into Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as allegations that he mishandled classified documents.",
      "The former president was indicted in the classified documents case as well, though Cannon dismissed the case in July 2024, deciding that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded. Trump had pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "The president-elect frequently criticized Smith, and he said in October that he would \u201cfire him within two seconds\u201d of taking office.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court ruled that the Justice Department could release Smith\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The court, however, kept in place Cannon\u2019s order that the report\u2019s release must be delayed for three days to allow for Trump to consider whether to appeal the decision further.",
      "Cannon said in a Saturday order that the Justice Department must submit a filing by 10 a.m. on Sunday confirming that the volume of Smith\u2019s report about alleged election interference does not discuss Walt Nauta or Carlos De Oliveira, two co-defendants in the classified documents case. Although the classified documents case against Trump was dropped, Nauta and De Oliveira still face charges.",
      "Smith has said that he would not release the second volume of his report regarding the classified documents case as charges against the co-defendants are pending."

    "summary": "Across the spectrum of American society, leaders who once shunned Trump or battled him are now seeking to bolster their ties or extend olive branches.",
    "story": [
      "In the weeks and months after Donald Trump won his shock election victory in 2016, business and tech leaders began a steady march leftward, adopting policies and postures to counter his influence on America.",
      "Media outlets reckoned with what some saw as their leading role in helping Trump get elected and pledged to be ruthless and unintimidated in their coverage of him and his administration.",
      "And Democrats, boosted by a grassroots \u201cresistance,\u201d readied for their biggest fight yet.",
      "That couldn\u2019t be any more different from the run-up to Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Now, executives are bending policies \u2014 and bending a proverbial knee \u2014\u00a0by abandoning their social and environmental agendas in manners that could appeal to Trump. Leaders of multiple major media platforms appear to be reorienting their coverage to be less antagonistic. And Democrats, without much of an active resistance to underpin them, have taken a wait-and-see approach to a new president with whom they already have eight years of experience.",
      "\u201cWe should treat him like a normal president,\u201d a senior aide to a Democratic senator said. \u201cBecause this is what normal presidents look like in America now.\u201d",
      "The shift is due in no small part to how Trump won last fall. Whereas in 2016 many saw a fluke, Trump this time swept the swing states and won the popular vote. His victory came after episodes like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his criminal indictments \u2014 headwinds many believed were insurmountable.",
      "What\u2019s more, much of his opposition, at least for now, appears to be drained after having fought him for nearly a decade. Now, Democrats feel they must pick their spots better.",
      "\u201cMy mission: be purposeful,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., whose profile soared as a leading Trump adversary during the president-elect\u2019s first term, wrote to NBC News. \u201cDon\u2019t chase the crazy. Bring it all back to \u2018how does that (ahem, invading Greenland) lower the cost of eggs?\u2019\u201d",
      "In turn, Trump is basking in a relatively warm embrace. His inaugural committee has raised so much money that it has run out of perks to give donors, The New York Times reported. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which banned Trump from those social media platforms after the 2021 attack on the Capitol, has donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. So has Amazon, which this week announced it will release a Melania Trump documentary through its Amazon Prime platform. The incoming first lady is listed as an executive producer of the project, which Amazon licensed for $40 million, Puck News reported.",
      "On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg cited the political climate\u2019s shift back toward Trump as his company made a flurry of moves indicating a desire to get right with the right. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s potential anti-regulatory agenda in a new term. And five of the country\u2019s biggest banks have in recent weeks announced their withdrawals from a pandemic-era climate coalition, the latest pullback from the environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, initiatives that became a major target for criticism on the right.",
      "\u201cMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but it is a little concerning that everybody sort of just said, \u2018We've got to give this guy what he wants,\u2019 right?\u201d a Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where the backstop is here.\u201d",
      "Trump views the dynamic more charitably.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to be my friend,\u201d he said in December.",
      "NBC News spoke with more than a dozen Democratic and Republican operatives and lobbyists, granting many of them anonymity to speak openly about the shifting energy that has followed Trump\u2019s win.",
      "A Republican lobbyist said the significant donations to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund and the abandonment of left-leaning corporate policies come as executives are \u201cscared to death\u201d of what the incoming administration could mean for them.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to pretend like they\u2019re in control,\u201d this person said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re just kind of nervous about being shut out entirely.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re pulling out of work from home. ESG. DEI,\u201d this person continued, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. \u201cThey\u2019re bending to his will, not the other way around.\u201d",
      "\u2018Surrender, or acceptance\u2019",
      "Meta\u2019s moves are among the most noteworthy. The company plans to elevate Republican Joel Kaplan to lead its global policy team, and on Monday it added Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump ally, to its board. Meta also announced it was ending a fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to the one Trump ally Elon Musk\u2019s X uses. And Zuckerberg boasted that the company was relocating content moderators from liberal California to ruby red Texas.",
      "\u201cRemember, at the start of Trump\u2019s first term, the mantra on the left is to not normalize,\u201d a veteran tech industry lobbyist said. \u201cDo not normalize. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s not just a question for the tech companies, but a larger societal, cultural and political issue,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of surrender, or acceptance.\u201d",
      "Eight years ago many top tech executives treated Trump as something of a curiosity. Meetings with him were more perfunctory and for show. Relationships soon worsened. Trump stridently criticized Bezos and the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post. Zuckerberg, too, was a frequent target, including last year, when Trump threatened him with \u201clife in prison\u201d if he did anything Trump viewed as illegal during the campaign. Both men have met privately with Trump in recent weeks, as have Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin.",
      "A source close to Trump said tech executives like Zuckerberg and Bezos are \u201csmart to play ball\u201d with him in a way they weren\u2019t eight years ago.",
      "\u201cThey know the anti-Trump side lost, and they know if they aren\u2019t playing nice with him, he\u2019ll try to bust them up,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a mix of fear, a mix of times-are-changing.\u201d",
      "A Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle described corporate America\u2019s response to the 2024 election as the exact inverse of its response after 2016.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that culturally, [Meta] and other companies feel like \u2018You know what? We actually don\u2019t need to be bullied by activists anymore,\u2019\u201d the operative said.",
      "Against that backdrop, intense disputes have broken out at a number of leading news organizations, including Bezos\u2019 Post as the newsroom navigates Trump\u2019s return to power.",
      "The Post, even though its editorial page staff drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, declined back a presidential candidate \u2014 a widely criticized decision that sources attributed to Bezos \u2014 just two weeks before the election. Last week, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit the paper after editors refused to publish her drawing depicting Bezos and other corporate leaders bending the knee to Trump. The Post\u2019s editorial page editor said the cartoon was rejected because the content was too similar to a recent column and that the decision was not a \u201creflection of a malign force.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, prompted resignations last year when he killed his editorial board\u2019s planned endorsement of Harris. Soon-Shiong has since proposed instituting a \u201cbias meter\u201d to evaluate the paper\u2019s published opinions while trying to steer a more moderate direction.",
      "At broadcast and cable outlets, there has been turmoil, too. ABC paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit with Trump. And at MSNBC, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who have been known for their critical stance toward Trump in recent years, traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with him after the election. Both episodes drew some criticism. While ABC did not elaborate on its decision to settle the suit, Scarborough and Brzezinski have defended their meeting with Trump as a useful reporting trip that helped inform their viewers.",
      "\u2018No one\u2019s quite sure what to do\u2019",
      "For Democrats, this is a confusing time. Many state-level leaders say they will find areas to work together with the administration while they push back against efforts they believe are harmful. In Congress, Democrats have expressed openness to some of Trump\u2019s more controversial Cabinet selections, like his pick for the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Others signed onto a Republican-backed immigration bill that advanced in the Senate on Thursday, the Laken Riley Act, which would allow the Department of Homeland Security to detain noncitizens who are charged with certain crimes.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s quite sure what to do,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything yet that shows me anybody\u2019s quite ready for this.\u201d",
      "Democrats, including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, have even expressed openness to Trump\u2019s calls to annex Greenland or rename the Gulf of Mexico \u2014\u00a0if other conditions are met first. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has expressed more openness to Trump than his Democratic colleagues, announced Thursday that he will soon meet with Trump, becoming the first sitting Democratic senator to do so since Trump won last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary to commit to cooperation with him at this point,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to gain from that.\u201d",
      "In a video posted to social media on Thursday, many Senate Democrats laid out their posture entering a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe are not here because of who we are against,\u201d the senators read. \u201cWe are here because of who we are for. \u2026 We are here to fight for Americans. We will work with anyone if they want to make life better for you. But if Donald Trump and Senate Republicans do things to hurt you, we will fight.\u201d",
      "The Republican operative close to Trump\u2019s circle said it\u2019s clear that this time around the Democratic response is \u201c100% different\u201d from what it was after Trump\u2019s 2016 win.",
      "\u201cThe resistance is dead,\u201d this person said. \u201cThere is no resistance anymore.\u201d",
      "But without Trump\u2019s even having taken office yet, some Democrats say it\u2019s far too soon to write off the anti-Trump opposition. Once he begins enacting policies, Democrats and outside allies will have more to push back on.",
      "Amanda Litman, a co-founder and the president of Run for Something, a grassroots progressive candidate recruitment group, said more than 12,000 people have signed up to run for offices since Trump\u2019s victory, a number she said nearly matched the total number of people who signed up in 2017, its launch year.",
      "\u201cA lot of the big \u2018resistance\u2019 stuff didn\u2019t really start happening until after Trump actually took office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels really early to say the resistance is fake or is dead. I think it\u2019ll look different. I think it\u2019ll feel different.\u201d",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans also urged caution on the olive branches and calls for bipartisanship Democrats have offered in recent weeks, noting that after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, Schumer also laid out areas in which the incoming administration and Democratic leaders could work together \u2014\u00a0an effort that in no way stunted the anti-Trump backlash.",
      "But for Democrats who were working in Washington during Trump\u2019s last transition, there was acknowledgment that something very different is happening now \u2014\u00a0and that there is a wider array of policies Democrats will be more likely to work with Trump and his allies on, with the Laken Riley Act serving as an early example.",
      "\u201cThere is an openness here this time that just did not exist last time,\u201d said the senior aide to a Democratic senator. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s especially [true] on immigration.\u201d",
      "This person said the driving force was the election itself. Democrats viewed 2016 as \u201ca freak accident\u201d compared with 2024, amounting to having \u201cflat-out lost.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got to sit here in the corner for a little bit until they start doing their thing, and we\u2019ll figure out our footing from that point,\u201d this person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any agreement on what Democrats should be doing right now.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Democrats will stand by idly during, say, Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort, as a former senior staff member for Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden said. This person said China policy, infrastructure, drug pricing and reshoring manufacturing are all policy areas in which Democrats will seek to work with Trump while fighting \u201ctooth and nail against mass deportations\u201d or any efforts to \u201cweaponize\u201d the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cThe party is going through a moment of disbelief that they lost,\u201d this person said.",

Governors including Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Gavin Newsom in California \u2014 whom Trump has spent days blaming for devastating wildfires around Los Angeles \u2014 Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania and JB Pritzker in Illinois try to toe a fine line.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all working together, obviously, but there\u2019s a little bit of an island\u201d for each governor, said a senior aide to a Democratic governor. \u201cObviously Pritzker\u2019s got the safeguarding democracy thing. Gavin Newsom is calling special sessions. I think everybody\u2019s trying to individually find their path forward, to be unique in a way that doesn\u2019t draw unnecessary attention but highlights that you know they care about their own particular state.\u201d",
      "Democratic pollster John Anzalone said newfound bipartisanship \u201cis a winning equation for everyone\u201d in this moment, particularly at the state level. He praised remarks by Whitmer.",
      "\u201cLook at Whitmer, she basically said Trump loves Michigan, too, and we will work with him to get done what is needed for Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to stand up when he is wrong and just as important to come together and get things done.\u201d",
      "But that approach has roiled some on the left, who struggle to believe Democrats can be taking such a wait-and-see approach to a president whose actions and governance aren\u2019t mysteries.",
      "\u201cTo see some Democrats saying, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just wait and see\u2019 \u2014 no, we actually don\u2019t need to wait and see,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, a progressive grassroots group. \u201cWe have the better part of a decade of evidence and all his campaign promises to tell us what he intends to do.\u201d"

      "Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote.",

      "Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss.",
      "So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk \u2014 but it\u2019s not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said.",
      "There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it\u2019s gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also \u201cmakes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst,\u201d she added.",
      "BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there\u2019s a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the \u201crisk of potentially rapid price plunges\u201d and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute\u00a0wrote\u00a0in early December.",

      "Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote.",
      "\u201cWhile crypto has been classified as a commodity, it\u2019s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio,\u201d wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm\u2019s Financial Advisor Services unit.",
      "Dollar-cost average and hold for the long term",
      "Ultimately, one\u2019s total crypto allocation is a function of an investor\u2019s appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors.",

      "Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth.",
      "\u201cI think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it\u2019s not for everyone and it will remain volatile,\u201d Boneparth said. \u201cAs far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be winners.\u201d",

      "\u201cI buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that way I\u2019m not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously.\u201d",
      "It\u2019d also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said.",

    "summary": "Why is Robbie Williams a monkey in the biopic Better Man? The pop star opened up about the decision and the director explained why. Here is the meaning.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.K., Robbie Williams is a major megastar \u2014 and has been for decades. But not so much in the U.S. For whatever reason, Williams\u2019 charming, edgy pop tunes and self-deprecating sense of humor never have quite clicked with Americans.",
      "That might change with the new biopic about Williams, \u201cBetter Man,\u201d which first opened in theaters on Dec. 25 but is about to go wide on Jan. 17.",
      "Following the beats of a classic biopic, \"Better Man\" has a major twist: Williams \u2014 who voices and sings the character \u2014 is portrayed as a computer-generated chimpanzee.",
      "Let\u2019s find out why.",
      "Who is Robbie Williams?",
      "Williams, now 50, got his start in a big boy band that debuted in the 1990s called Take That. They were huge in the U.K., and still rock out today with three members (but not Williams).",
      "Williams left in 1995 and went solo, releasing his debut album, \u201cLife thru a Lens\u201d in 1997. His single \u201cAngels\u201d was a hit in the U.K., but only charted at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. \u2014 though it\u2019s since been covered by artists ranging from Jessica Simpson to Josh Groban.",
      "Williams has since gone on release 14 studio albums, with seven No. 1 singles in the U.K., and broke a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in one day to his \u201cClose Encounters Tour.\u201d",
      "His life hasn\u2019t been all broken records and chart-toppers. He\u2019s had to overcome mental health issues and addictions over the years, as the movie depicts.",
      "He is now married to the American actor Ayda Field and they live in Los Angeles with their four children.",
      "What is \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "\"Better Man\" is a live-action biopic about Williams in which he's portrayed as a chimpanzee, unlike everyone else in the film. No characters comment on his appearance, however.",
      "The movie follows his story of great fame and great talent, battling with emotional pain, illness and estrangement with his father.",
      "Williams is his own narrator and singer in the film, while Jonno Davies plays the chimp form. The movie is directed by Michael Gracey, who also directed Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron in 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Showman.\u201d",
      "Weta FX, the special effects team behind the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d reboots, are behind the movie magic.",
      "Why is Robbie Williams an ape in \u2018Better Man\u2019?",
      "First off, let\u2019s be clear: Chimpanzees are not monkeys \u2014 even if that's the word often used to describe the \"Better Man\" character. Chimps are apes. (The quickest way to tell between an ape and a monkey? Whether the animal has a tail. Apes don't have them; monkeys generally do)",
      "As to why Williams is a chimp? Well, it\u2019s a metaphor.",
      "In a promotional video where Williams and Gracey interview each other, Gracey told his star, \u201cIn your own words you would refer to being dragged up on stage to perform like a monkey. I immediately thought of portraying you not as we see you, but as how you see yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith your voice and that monkey, I\u2019m going to see you and relate to you in a way that is going to be more engaging than yet another musical biopic,\u201d Gracey added.",
      "In an interview with the Associated Press, Williams said that he\u2019s identified with primates for a long time.",
      "\u201cMy MO has been cheeky,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cheeky monkey all my life. There\u2019s no more cheekier monkey than the coke-snorting, sex-addict monkey that we find in the movie.\u201d",
      "Plus, Williams said, the gimmick was a way for the audience to better identify with him.",
      "\u201cWe care for animals more than we care for humans, most of us,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to USA Today, Williams also called the premise \"genius\" in the way that it hooks audiences.",
      "The decision \u201chas done what it was supposed to do, which is to get people talking and be contentious. I would say it\u2019s about eight to 12 minutes where the audience is going, \u2018What?\u2019 and then you completely forget and you\u2019re taken on a ride that you\u2019ve never seen,\u201d he said."

But I know a lot of other moms don't have that support, or don't feel like they do, so I can't imagine how that night turns out for them. It's frightening and sad.",

Having a kid is the hardest thing. When I talk to other moms about it, I'm like, \"Isn't this traumatic and crazy?\" And we're expected to walk around like we're fine. That's why I want to share my own experience \u2014 to show other moms that they're not alone, and also to encourage them to ask for help and seek support. That means being honest about my own support system."

      "The collaboration commenced with Season 4, Episode 9, of \"Abbott Elementary\" and will continue with a follow-up episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" expected to air in the show's upcoming Season 17.",
      "Part 1 of the Philadelphia-centric crossover premiered on ABC Jan. 8 and saw the \"It's Always Sunny\" gang spar with the teachers at Abbott while volunteering to fulfill a community service requirement.",
      "Here's everything to know about the episode, and when to expect a Part 2.",
      "Where to watch the 'Abbott Elementary' episode, featuring the 'It's Always Sunny' cast",
      "Part 1 of the \"Abbott Elementary\" and \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" crossover coincided with the midseason premiere of \"Abbott Elementary.\" The shows air on different networks but share the setting of Philadelphia.",
      "As of Jan. 9, the episode is available to stream on Hulu.",
      "The second crossover is expected to be an episode of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" which has aired on FXX since 2013.",
      "When does the crossover air?",
      "Part 1 of the \"Abbott Elementary\" and \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" crossover aired on Wednesday, Jan. 8, at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT.",
      "The second crossover is expected later in 2025, but Season 17 of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" has yet to get a premiere date.",
      "Rob McElhenney told Rolling Stone in an interview that the second crossover with \"Abbott Elementary\" will air \"four or five months\" after the first.",
      "What happened in Part 1 of the crossover?",
      "According to a description of the episode, Ava (Janelle James) \"announces the school district is sending a group of volunteers to help out at Abbott.\" Unfortunately, \"things don't go as planned\" when they arrive.",
      "In the episode, called \"Volunteers,\" the \"It's Always Sunny\" crew arrives at Abbott to fulfill a community service requirement after a crime spree.",

Janitor Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) and newcomer Frank (Danny DeVito) fight over how best to repel raccoons in the school's garden and fittingly exchange insults over who is more \"trash\"-like.",
      "But the groups don't completely disagree. Charlie (Charlie Day) spends time with Jacob (Chris Perfetti), Melissa (Lisa Ann Walter) and Barbara (Sheryl Lee Ralph), and the teachers realize he struggles to read. After helping him sound out words in a picture book, Charlie is honored at a \"moving up\" ceremony to show his mastery of the kindergarten reading level.",

      "In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, McElhenney said he and Brunson were eager to do a two-part crossover.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s what we keyed in on very early. That would be the most fun because we get to play the same characters in the tone of 'Abbott,' and they get to play the same characters from 'Abbott' in the tone of 'Sunny.' That\u2019s what will allow us to satisfy the authenticity of each show but then also stretch and do something different,\" he said.",
      "What will happen in the second crossover episode?",
      "Part 2 of the crossover will air at a later date since production on Season 17 of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" recently finished, per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "When determining which episode would air first, McElhenney said it made the most sense to start with \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think just by nature of the schedule. In some ways, you look at the \u2018Abbott\u2019 episode, and it stands on its own, and it\u2019s so great, and it\u2019s a fully realized story,\" McElhenney said.",
      "But the \"It's Always Sunny\" episode will cast the episode \u2014 and its jokes \u2014 in a new light.",
      "\"Then when you see our episode, it feels like it\u2019s almost like a giant setup, and then this is the punchline,\" he said. \"But then you can watch them in either order, and they both make sense.\"",
      "The crossover episode of \"Abbott Elementary\" ended with the gang meeting their volunteer hours requirement and leaving the school, to the Abbott teachers' relief.",
      "The next crossover will be told through the \"prism of 'Sunny,'\" McElhenney said.",
      "Could the \"Abbott Elementary\" cast stop by Paddy's Pub? After all, Melissa has already been\u00a0\u2014 though she called it \u201cthe skeeviest bar\u201d she's ever been to."

    "summary": "What is the meaning of Zendaya's engagement ring? Jewelers break down the meaning, style, setting carats and price of the diamond. Inside the east west diamond.",
    "story": [
      "When Zendaya walked the Golden Globes red carpet on Jan. 5, it wasn\u2019t her and long-time stylist Law Roach\u2019s ability to perfect a look that caught people\u2019s attention.",
      "It was the diamond rock perched on her left ring finger.",
      "Fans began speculating Zendaya was wearing an engagement ring, indicating she and Tom Holland had decided to take the next step in their relationship.",
      "TMZ and People reported the engagement on Jan. 6, citing sources close to the couple. TODAY.com has reached out to Zendaya and Holland for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Zendaya is keeping mum \u2014 but her ring tells a story, jewelry experts say.",
      "Laura Taylor, an engagement ring specialist at the U.K. based jewelry brand Lorel Diamonds, estimates the diamond in Zendaya\u2019s ring comes in at about five carats. The stone has a horizontal, or \u201ceast-west,\u201d orientation and is set a Georgian-style cut-down, also called a button-back setting. The ring is two-tone, featuring both gold and silver-hued metals.",
      "The effect, Taylor says, is the perfect example of \u201cOld Hollywood glamour with a modern twist.\u201d The cushion-cut diamond and the button-back setting give the ring vintage familiarity, whereas the east-west orientation and mixed metals make it feel edgy.",
      "Typically found in antiques, the button-back setting is unique because the jewel is fully encircled with metal and prongs (in this case, six), allowing it to sit lower on the band. Taylor calls the low setting a \u201cpractical\u201d choice with an heirloom feel.",
      "The east-west orientation, an alternative to the more typical vertical style, also gives the ring an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle yet confident way to say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this our way,\u2019\u201d Taylor says.",
      "The east-west orientation also symbolizes \u201cequal partnership and commitment,\u201d Julia Briggs Parsons, founder and CEO of luxury jewelry brand Incredible Rising, says.",
      "Jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 believes the ring was designed by Jessica McCormack. TODAY.com has reached out to the jeweler for comment. \u201cShe\u2019s giving quiet luxury \u2014 Jessica McCormack is very, \u2018If you know, you know,\u2019\u201d Chaf\u00e9 says.",
      "Based on the brand and the size of the stone, Chaf\u00e9 estimates the ring cost over $200,000.",
      "Initially, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised the ring was not designed by Bulgari, as Zendaya is an ambassador for the luxury brand. In fact, Zendaya and Bulgari\u2019s long relationship was a clue into the engagement. At the Golden Globes, Bulgari took credit for all of Zendaya\u2019s jewelry \u2014 except the ring on her left hand.",
      "The seemingly deliberate choice by the couple makes the ring all the more personal. \u201cThis engagement ring looks like it\u2019s been handed down through generations of love stories,\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Uniquely theirs, jewelers also predict features in Zendaya's ring, like the button-back setting and east-west orientation, will rise in popularity, just like Selena Gomez's recent engagement ring may do for marquise cuts.",

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which are uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "The number of people killed in Gaza during Israel's deadly offensive in the Palestinian enclave is significantly higher than the figures reported by local health authorities, researchers at a leading health university in Britain have found.",
      "In a peer-reviewed study published Thursday in The Lancet journal, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said they estimated that as many as 64,260 people were killed in \"traumatic injury deaths\" in Gaza between Oct. 7, 2023 and June 30, 2024.",
      "The authors of the study estimate that the death toll for the first nine months of the war was around 41% higher than the figure of 37,877 reported by the Palestinian health ministry.",
      "Women, children under the age of 18 and people over 65 accounted for 59.1% of the 28,257 deaths for which age and sex data were available. Researchers did not provide an estimate of the number of Palestinian combatants killed. Health authorities in Gaza also do not publish data on militants killed."

      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work.

      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",

      "Orilas Jean Francois was also forced to leave Haiti, under extenuating circumstances, he said. Back home he owned construction and finance businesses, which provided a stable life for his family, he said. But in early 2024, Francois started to conceive an escape plan from the violence and economic collapse that define the island nation today.",

      "Port-au-Prince is facing a surge in violence, with at least 5,600 killings and nearly 1,500 kidnappings reported last year, according to the United Nations. A December massacre in Cit\u00e9 Soleil claimed at least 207 lives, with victims mutilated, burned or dumped at sea by the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie gang.",
      "Political unrest and gang violence delayed his departure from Haiti multiple times, even after he was authorized to enter the U.S. under the Humanitarian Parole Program.",
      "\u201cIn March, I had my ticket and my documents ready to travel, but a massive prison break left the streets unsafe and flights were canceled,\u201d Francois said. His trip was delayed so many times that his initial authorization expired, forcing him to petition USCIS for an extension. \u201cThe stress was unbearable.\u201d",
      "Francois finally arrived in the U.S. in July under the program.After living with his family in New York City for a few months, Francois said he is focused on learning English and finding steady work.",

      "Francois and Dolcine both emphasized their commitment to self-sufficiency, pushing back on rhetoric about migrants relying on government aid.",
      "The temporary programs, however, come with issues. Last year, the Humanitarian Parole Program was briefly paused after at least 101,000 applications were filed by so-called serial sponsors, repeatedly using the same contact information and Social Security numbers, according to USCIS.",
      "Nonetheless, Dolcine highlighted the contributions of Haitian migrants in the United States, who are predominantly employed in service-related occupations, with a significant presence in health care support roles.

      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, which provides help for Haitians locally and in their home country, underscored the emotional toll of living in limbo.",

      "As Trump threatens to dismantle programs that provide a lifeline for migrants like Dolcine and Francois, they remain steadfast, drawing strength from their faith and dreams. \u201cHe talks a lot,\u201d Dolcine said with a smile, referring to the president-elect. \u201cI\u2019m just going to live in the moment and let things be.\u201d"

      "Maduro accused the opposition of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war,\u201d and said the faction\u2019s failure to stop the inauguration was \u201ca great Venezuelan victory.\u201d He accused external powers of \u201cattacking\u201d Venezuela, specifically the U.S. government, and promised to guarantee \u201cpeace and national sovereignty.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\u201d",
      "The opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines following the July 28 election, posted the tallies online and said they show Gonz\u00e1lez won twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election on the government\u2019s invitation, declared the opposition-published tallies legitimate. Other election experts that the government allowed to witness the vote said polling records posted online by the opposition appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",
      "On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials who had a role in the country\u2019s 2024 election, including the president and vice president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, the electoral agency and others. The 27-nation bloc said those officials have put the nation\u2019s democracy at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department also slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, including the president of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Maduro\u2019s transportation minister and state-owned airline, among others.",
      "On Thursday, as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, aides to opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she was briefly detained by security forces and coerced into recording videos.",
      "The popular former lawmaker, whom the government has barred from running for office, had emerged from months of hiding to join the rally to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be sworn in instead of Maduro.",
      "Machado addressed the rally then left on a motorcycle with her security convoy. Machado\u2019s press team later announced on social media that security forces \u201cviolently intercepted\u201d her convoy. Her aides confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner was detained.",
      "Leaders in the Americas and Europe condemned the government for suppressing opposition voices and demanded her release. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "\u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Maduro\u2019s supporters denied that Machado was arrested, saying government opponents were spreading fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "The brouhaha ahead of Maduro\u2019s inauguration added to the litany of allegations of electoral fraud and brutal repression to silence dissent.",
      "Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 also filled with allies of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela \u2014 to audit the election results. The court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory without providing thorough evidence and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But neither the council nor the ruling party produced any evidence that Maduro had won, even though their voting center representatives also were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The dispute over the results prompted international outrage and nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest and many protesters reported being tortured in custody.",
      "Outside Friday\u2019s inauguration ceremony, Maduro\u2019s supporters were overjoyed. One of them was Maricarmen Ruiz, 18, who couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have words to express my emotion, I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said, expressing relief that opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez wasn\u2019t \u201cimposed\u201d instead as president.",
      "It is unclear how many heads of state attended Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, hosted by the ruling party-controlled National Assembly. Cameras showed Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega and Cuba\u2019s Miguel Diaz-Canel, and Maduro greeted delegates from what he said numbered more than 120 nations.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, said he would skip the event citing the detentions earlier in the week of another longtime Venezuelan opposition member and a human rights defender.",
      "Maduro\u2019s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. The 2018 election was widely considered a sham after his government banned major opposition parties from participating.",
      "And it remains unclear if Gonz\u00e1lez, who left for exile in Spain in September, will fulfill his promise to return to Venezuela by Friday.",
      "Government officials have repeatedly threatened Gonz\u00e1lez with arrest should he step on Venezuelan soil. On Tuesday, Gonz\u00e1lez said his son-in-law Rafael Tudares had been kidnapped in Caracas. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s daughter, Mariana Gonz\u00e1lez de Tudares, suggested in a statement that the government was behind her husband\u2019s disappearance.",
      "\u201cAt what point did being related to Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia become a crime?\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "In the final weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House, the focus of his public remarks has not been about the confirmations of his Cabinet picks or on key parts of his campaign agenda like mass deportations or lowering prices.",
      "Instead, Trump \u2014 who has criticized U.S. military involvement in other countries \u2014 is advocating for America to gain more global territory, including by force, if necessary. Call it his annexation agenda.",
      "In recent days, Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea that he will take over Greenland from Denmark, reclaim the Panama Canal after the United States returned it to the Panamanian government decades ago and absorb Canada into the United States. Trump said he is keeping the option of using the military to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal on the table while saying he will exert \u201ceconomic force\u201d to pressure Canada to join the United States. He has also said he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, North America\u2019s tallest peak.",
      "Panamanian, Danish and Canadian leaders have all shot down Trump\u2019s wishes, with responses ranging from no to not \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s willingness to provoke longtime U.S. allies and throw out unexpected demands gives a glimpse of the domestic, and global, shakeup he hopes to accomplish. Democrats and Republicans who spoke to NBC News, including close Trump allies, said some of his recent demands are serious and some are ways to gain leverage for other parts of his agenda, while others are just trolling.",
      "Greenland is an island Trump very much desires. A person familiar with the discussions said Trump has never given up on acquiring Greenland, which he tried to purchase during his first term for defense reasons and was rebuffed.",
      "This person added that Trump also enjoys the way the effort gets people spun up. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took a trip to Nuuk, the largest population center on the island of about 57,000 people, and the president-elect called in to deliver a message to Greenlanders.",
      "Acquiring the Panama Canal falls into the category of something Trump may want but is also using as an economic pressure campaign.",
      "For years, he has felt that President Jimmy Carter should not have returned the Panama Canal to Panama. But John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser who has since broken with him, told NBC News in an interview that while he served under Trump he didn\u2019t hear any talk of acquiring the Panama Canal (or making Canada the 51st state). The person familiar also said reclaiming the canal was not a focus during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "But it is now on the table because of another part of Trump\u2019s agenda: combating the influence of China.",
      "According to this person and a second person familiar with the discussions, Trump allies have shown the president-elect data they argue shows Chinese encroachment in the Western Hemisphere, including the accusation that Panama has the ability to prioritize Chinese over American shipping. The second person familiar with the discussions said Trump\u2019s threat to take the canal is \u201ca negotiating tool\u201d to get Panama to get more favorable treatment for U.S. shipments.",
      "On Canada, Trump\u2019s remarks amount to \u201can epic troll,\u201d the first person said, adding that he is not serious about absorbing the country into the United States. Yet, this person said, Trump believes his trolling could get some policies to cut his way and help with negotiations. Last month, Canadian officials announced a plan to increase spending on border security, which was a focus of the Republican presidential primary campaign last year.",
      "\u201cI split those into two buckets,\u201d a senior aide to a GOP senator said, noting that the propositions to reclaim the Panama Canal and acquire Greenland are \u201cmore serious,\u201d pointing to Trump Jr.\u2019s visit to Greenland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t take Canada as seriously,\u201d this person added. \u201cHe\u2019s just making fun of [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, some of Trump\u2019s earliest ambassador picks were for Canada, Denmark and Panama, and his statements announcing the latter two included references to Greenland and the Panama Canal.John D. Feeley, who was the U.S. ambassador to Panama under President Barack Obama and Trump before he resigned over policy disagreements with Trump, said Trump\u2019s public push will put incoming ambassadors behind the eight ball.",
      "\u201cIf Trump attempts to operationalize the threats made to Panama, Canada and Greenland \u2026 it\u2019s going to put any ambassador in the most difficult position I can conceive of: telling a treaty ally your boss plans to take their sovereign homeland,\u201d Feeley said.",
      "Countering China's influence",
      "Trump and his allies have pointed to national security as the rationale for why the U.S. should acquire Greenland, with Trump posting on his Truth Social platform last month that American \u201cownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\u201d The island, which has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century, was fully integrated into Denmark in 1953 under the country\u2019s constitution, and it became a self-governing territory in 1979. Greenlanders have full citizenship in Denmark.",
      "Greenland is closer to New York than Copenhagen, and the United States briefly occupied it during World War II. It is home to a large U.S. Air Force base and major mineral reserves. In recent years, China has sought to make inroads on the island.",
      "Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Denmark, said the Danes simply do not have the capacity to properly defend the island, while China\u2019s attempts to boost ties with Greenland have had American officials on high alert.",
      "\u201cWe are great partners and allies with Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had diplomatic relations with them for 200 years. They\u2019re founding members of NATO. So we\u2019re good friends, but good friends sometimes have to have tough conversations. And one of the conversations was, \u2018How are you going to defend Greenland, part of your kingdom, when you can\u2019t even defend Denmark proper?\u2019\"",
      "\u201cThe only capabilities that Denmark controls for Greenland are defense and foreign policy; everything else Greenland controls,\u201d Sands added. \u201cAnd that makes Greenland really, really vulnerable to bad actors, because they want economic growth.\u201d",
      "But Rufus Gifford, the ambassador to Denmark in the Obama administration and finance chair of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, said gaining Greenland would not be anywhere near as simple as Trump may make it seem.For starters, Gifford said, \u201cany Danish prime minister that loses Greenland in this day and age would be the laughingstock of the country, and would be forever.\u201d And, he added, Greenlanders may not want to give up their \u201cfairly privileged place in Danish society.\u201d",
      "As far as national security concerns go, Gifford said any military incursion into Greenland would invoke NATO\u2019s Article Five, which requires the alliance\u2019s members to defend it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly concern about Chinese influence in Greenland, and there should be,\u201d he said, adding, though, \u201cthe only reason why you would say that, for national security reasons, Greenland needs to be American would be if you\u2019re threatening to pull out of NATO. And that part is all the scarier.\u201d",
      "When it comes to the Panama Canal, Trump has framed his own focus on U.S. ships being \u201covercharged\u201d to use the waterway, as he said Tuesday, while he believes Chinese ships are getting preferential treatment. Trump also said he long believed Carter was mistaken to have negotiated treaties that turned over control of the canal to Panama.",
      "A Hong Kong-based company operates two of the five ports that serve the canal. China, via its 2020 national security law, has extended its influence over Hong Kong.",
      "Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who said in December that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to be so,\u201d denied last month that China has influence over the waterway, which the Panama Canal Authority administers.",
      "\u201cIn the president\u2019s universe of alternate facts, he can huff and puff and maybe Panama will return him the canal,\u201d Feeley said. \u201cIn the real world, however, Panama is not about to return the canal. What he has done, in practical political terms, is solidify tremendous support among the 4.3 million Panamanians around Mulino, a relatively new president.\u201d",
      "'A full-on takedown'",
      "Trump has mocked the Canadian government for weeks after he met with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, to discuss the potential for tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods imported into the United States. He has called Trudeau, who announced his resignation this week, \u201cGov. Trudeau\u201d and suggested Canadians would love to be the 51st state. He has even called for hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, a famous Canadian who has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago, to run for prime minister.",
      "At his news conference Tuesday, Trump said he would use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to merge Canada with the United States, describing the northern border as an \u201cartificially drawn line.\u201d He lamented the United States\u2019 \u201cspending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada,\u201d a NATO ally that also shares a military alliance with the United States through North American Aerospace Defense Command.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s comments, Trudeau said on X: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\u201d",

Trudeau\u2019 and talk about Canada as the 51st state. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much thought beyond that.\u201d",
      "Bolton said it would be wrong to look at Trump\u2019s interest in acquiring foreign territory and conclude he is rolling out a new strategic vision for the United States.",
      "\u201cThere is no philosophy\u201d behind Trump\u2019s statements,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThere is no strategy. This is this week\u2019s series of neuron flashes.\u201d",
      "Coupled with calls from Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and Trump\u2019s sidekick, to replace leadership in the United Kingdom and Germany, Trump is putting immense pressure on some of America\u2019s closest allies before he even takes office. Trudeau\u2019s resignation was, in part, connected to Trump\u2019s pressure campaign and calls to implement sweeping tariffs.",
      "\u201cYou could make the argument that he took down Justin Trudeau just now,\u201d Gifford said, adding: \u201cMusk is trying to do the same in both the U.K. and Germany right now. So this isn\u2019t just like diplomatic pressure. This is like a full-on takedown of some of our best allies.\u201d",
      "Conservative media has boosted Trump\u2019s annexation effort in recent days. On Fox News, prime-time host Sean Hannity has promoted it as a wise endeavor. Then, the New York Post, one of Trump\u2019s favorite publications, highlighted the \u201cDonroe Doctrine\u201d on its Wednesday cover, a play on President James Monroe\u2019s 19th century outline of the U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Congressional Republicans are already pushing legislation to advance the agenda. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., plans to introduce a bill Thursday that would allow Trump to \u201center into negotiations for the reacquisition of the Panama Canal.\u201d And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced moments after Trump called to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America\u201d on Tuesday that she would introduce legislation in the House to do so.",
      "The first person familiar with the discussions told NBC News that Trump first expressed interest in changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico last month and that the president-elect was fixated on the idea, though people close to him do not believe he can do much it. But this person said Trump\u2019s push to rename Denali back to Mount McKinley is serious, and unlike changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, changing the name is fully within the power of the U.S. government. Obama changed the name from Mount McKinley to Denali, its earlier name, in 2015.",
      "Democrats have offered a mixed response to the agenda. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday on X that he \u201cwould welcome\u201d Greenland as the 53rd state \u201cright after we admit Puerto Rico and Washington DC.\u201d And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that he would \u201cagree to working with Donald Trump on renaming the Gulf of Mexico, only if he first agrees to work with us on an actual plan to lower costs for Americans.\u201d",
      "But with Democrats struggling to find their footing in the second Trump administration, a Pennsylvania Democrat expressed worry that Trump\u2019s effort, if it succeeds, could be detrimental to the party\u2019s chances at the ballot box.",

      "This month, Danish King Frederik changed the historic royal coat of arms to emphasize the Greenlandic symbol of the polar bear, telling viewers in his New Year's address that \u201cwe are all united ... all the way to Greenland.\u201d",
      "Connected or not, the president-elect has repeatedly discussed the idea of purchasing Greenland, having eyed the territory \u2014\u00a0with its large U.S. Air Force base and pristine rare mineral reserves \u2014 since his first term in office.",
      "Trump's comments in a post on his Truth Social platform this week, that \u201cGreenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,\u201d appeared to impress at least some Greenlanders.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s parliament elected army chief\u00a0Joseph Aoun\u00a0head of state on Thursday, filling the vacant presidency with a general who enjoys U.S. approval and showing the diminished sway of the Iran-backed\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0group after its devastating war with Israel.",
      "The outcome reflected shifts in the power balance in Lebanon and the\u00a0wider Middle East, with Shi\u2019ite Muslim Hezbollah badly pummeled from last year\u2019s war, and its Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad toppled in December.",
      "It also indicated a revival of Saudi influence in a country where Riyadh\u2019s role was eclipsed by Iran and Hezbollah long ago.",
      "U.S. ambassador to\u00a0Lebanon\u00a0Lisa Johnson said she was \u201cvery happy\u201d over Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun\u2019s election as president on Thursday, ending a more than two-year vacuum in the post.",
      "Johnson and other foreign envoys had attended Thursday\u2019s session at the Lebanese parliament in which Aoun was elected.",
      "The election of a new Lebanese president turns a new page for the country and must now be followed by the appointment of a new government capable of carrying out reforms, France\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.",
      "Foreign ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine said that a new government will have carry out reforms necessary for\u00a0Lebanon\u2019s economic recovery, stability, security and sovereignty, and added that France calls on all Lebanese political leaders and authorities to work towards those goals.",
      "The presidency, reserved for a Maronite Christian in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system, has been vacant since Michel Aoun\u2019s term ended in October 2022, with deeply divided factions unable to agree on a candidate able to win enough votes in the 128-seat parliament.",
      "Aoun fell short of the 86 votes needed in a first round vote, but crossed the threshold with 99 votes in a second round, according to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, after lawmakers from Hezbollah and its Shi\u2019ite ally the Amal Movement backed him.",
      "Momentum built behind Aoun on Wednesday as Hezbollah\u2019s long preferred candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, withdrew and declared support for the army commander, and as French and Saudi envoys shuttled around Beirut, urging his election in meetings with politicians, three Lebanese political sources said.",
      "\u201cThere is a very clear message from the international community that they are ready to support Lebanon, but that needs a president, a government,\u201d Michel Mouawad, a Christian lawmaker opposed to Hezbollah who voted for Aoun, told Reuters before the vote. \u201cWe did get a message from Saudi of support,\u201d he added.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election is a first step towards reviving government institutions in a country which has had neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet since Aoun left office.",
      "Lebanon, its economy still reeling from a devastating\u00a0financial collapse\u00a0in 2019, is in dire need of international support to rebuild from the war, which the World Bank estimates cost the country $8.5 billion.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s system of government requires the new president to convene consultations with lawmakers to nominate a Sunni Muslim prime minister to form a new cabinet, a process that can often be protracted as factions barter over ministerial portfolios.",
      "Aoun has a key role in shoring up a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0between Hezbollah and Israel which was brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces.",
      "He told lawmakers on Thursday that he will work to ensure the state has the exclusive right to carry arms, in his first speech at parliament after he was elected.",
      "His comments were seen partly as a reference to Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal, which he had not commented on publicly as the former army commander.",
      "Aoun, 60, has been commander of the U.S.-backed Lebanese army since 2017. On his watch, U.S. aid continued to flow to the army, part of a long-standing U.S. policy focused on supporting state institutions to curb Hezbollah\u2019s influence."

      "The\u00a0pope\u00a0also addressed conflicts in places including Sudan, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Nicaragua and reiterated his frequent calls for action to confront the impacts of global climate change, and the spread of misinformation on social media."
